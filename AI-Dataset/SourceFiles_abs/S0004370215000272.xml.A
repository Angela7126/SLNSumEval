      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      When considering knowledge-based agents, it seems natural to think that the beliefs of the agent are precisely those that follow from the assumption that the knowledge base (KB) is all that is known.{sup:1} Think, for example, of an agent whose KB has a secret p, and nothing else. The agent, then, should not only infer that she knows a secret, which is p, but also that she does not know of any other secrets. In some situations it may be possible to fully specify the beliefs and non-beliefs of an agent, in which case classical epistemic logic suffices [1]. But in general, as has been argued elsewhere [2], [3], a perspicuous characterization of the agent's epistemic state is very useful. This is especially significant from the perspective of a designer of some putative agent who would be representing the agent's beliefs in terms of a KB.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Levesque [4] was among the first to capture such a notion explicitly in his logic of “only knowing.” His proposal, the logic {a mathematical formula}OL, is very simple. He augments a logic of belief [5], [6], where (say) the modality K denotes knowledge, with a modality O to capture the notion of only knowing. Beliefs are reasoned about in terms of valid sentences of the form:{a mathematical formula} which is to be read as “if KB is all that is believed by the agent, then the agent knows α.” What is particularly interesting about the new modality is that it not only allows one to draw conclusions about what is known but also about what is not. For example, {a mathematical formula}Op⊃¬Kq and, by introspection, {a mathematical formula}Op⊃K¬Kq both come out valid. Note that this is quite different from classical epistemic logic, in the sense that if we replace O by K, then neither of these sentences is valid. Thus, an agent is able to reason about its own ignorance, without having to be told explicitly what it does not know. Remarkably, the new modality has very intuitive (and simple) truth conditions: roughly a semantics is specified wrt a set of worlds e, where worlds are truth valuations; a KB is only known just in case it is true in all worlds in e and one cannot add more worlds without falsifying at least one of the formulas of the KB. These ideas have since been applied to a number of knowledge representation problems, including, for example, reasoning about dynamical systems [7].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      When the KB itself refers to an agent's beliefs, then only knowing also exhibits a form of nonmonotonic reasoning. For example, consider the infamous Tweety default formulated as the following sentence δ:{a mathematical formula} which says that birds fly unless believed otherwise. Then, {a mathematical formula}O(Bird(Tweety)∧δ)⊃KFly(Tweety) is a valid sentence in Levesque's logic, and so Tweety is formally off the ground (as desired).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Readers may note that the nonmonotonicity exhibited by only knowing feels similar in spirit to Moore's autoepistemic logic (AEL) [8]. Levesque substantiated this by proving that Moore's stable expansions of a KB α, which are defined meta-theoretically using fixpoints, correspond precisely to the beliefs of an agent who only knows α. Thus, a reconstruction of a major branch of nonmonotonicity happens entirely within a monotonic logic. Levesque also proposed an axiomatization that characterizes the semantics in the propositional case, which allows, among other things, formal proofs of its flavor of nonmonotonicity. In his axiom system, to better understand the relationship between O and K, he interprets {a mathematical formula}Oα to syntactically denote {a mathematical formula}Kα∧N¬α using a new modal operator N. Here, {a mathematical formula}N¬α is to be read as “at most α is known,” which can be contrasted with the usual {a mathematical formula}Kα that, in fact, could be read as “at least α is known” since {a mathematical formula}Kα does not preclude {a mathematical formula}K(α∧β) from holding, in general. With this new operator in hand, Levesque shows that by treating K and N to be fully introspective, the following axiom is all that is needed to completely characterize the semantics:{a mathematical formula}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      This is clearly a novel axiom, and while it gives only knowing the intended properties, it also raises concerns when considering generalizations (as we shall shortly see). We remark that Levesque also proposed an axiomatic characterization for the first-order case, but this was shown to be incomplete by Halpern and Lakemeyer [9]. In fact, Halpern and Lakemeyer proved a stronger result: there cannot be a complete and recursive axiomatization.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Levesque's logic, however, only deals with a single agent. It seems perfectly natural to consider only knowing in the context of multiple agents. For example, imagine Alice having a secret p. It is reasonable to imagine that she believes the following:{a mathematical formula} If this sentence and p is all that Alice knows, then it should come out that Alice believes that Bob does not know her secret p. More generally, of course, one would often like to perspicuously characterize the beliefs of agents in multiagent settings, and here too, an account of only knowing would prove useful.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Motivated by such scenarios, a number of attempts have been made over the years to extend only knowing to the many agent case [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. That is, in contrast to classical epistemic logic where multiagent extensions are immediate [1], generalizing only knowing has been shown to be very challenging [12]. In a sense, this is because an interesting technicality: the modality O has a subtle relationship to the classical operator K which makes extensions non-trivial. Moreover, proposing an accompanying axiomatization is also challenging: notice that the multiagent version of A5 cannot be restricted to propositional formulas, since this would preclude us from performing derivations with nestings of only knowing operators. Unfortunately, this leads to a circularity: we would like such an axiom to hold for any consistent (not necessarily objective) formula, but to deal with consistency we would need an axiom system.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We discuss the aforementioned attempts in greater detail in the subsequent sections, but basically, we show that all of them have undesirable properties:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="•">
       Early propositional proposals by Lakemeyer [10] and Halpern [11] are shown to exhibit unintuitive features about only knowing. In fact, in later work, Halpern and Lakemeyer [12] argue why neither of these proposals satisfactorily capture only knowing.
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="•">
       To remedy some of the shortcomings of their proposals, Halpern and Lakemeyer [12] developed a revised account that does seem to successfully model multiagent only knowing. But it has proof-theoretic notions in the semantics. Precisely for this reason, that proposal is not natural. Most significantly, it is not clear how their ideas would generalize to the first-order case. That is, as we already noted above, there cannot be a complete first-order axiomatization of only-knowing even for a single agent. Hence we cannot even get off the ground envisaging a semantics that appeals to its own proof theory as in [12]. Finally, for generalizing A5, they define the semantic notion of validity directly in the language as a modal operator, which adds considerable complexity to the axiomatization for technical reasons only.
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="•">
       Lastly, an approach by Waaler [13] avoids such an axiomatization of validity, but by appealing to a sequent calculus formulation. To characterize the truth conditions for this axiom system, they provide a rather involved model-theoretic account formulated over Kripke structures that are required to satisfy a number of non-trivial constraints. Moreover, here too, only a propositional language is considered.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      It is worth noting that all these attempts appeal to arbitrary Kripke structures, and thus already deviate from Levesque's simple model theory that understands worlds as truth valuations.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In sum, despite the many attempts, it has remained an open question whether there is a natural semantics for only knowing in the multiagent setting for a first-order language. Provided such a semantics can be found, a second question is whether there is a proof theory for the propositional subset which avoids the complications introduced in [12]. The crucial item on the agenda, of course, is an appropriate generalization of A5. A third question is if this line of work would lead to a first-order multiagent generalization of AEL.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In this work, we answer in the affirmative for all three questions.{sup:2} We show that for a quantified language with equality, there is indeed a semantics for multiagent only knowing that extends Levesque's approach in a natural way. There is a caveat, however. The semantics is not defined for simultaneously satisfying an infinite set of sentences with unbounded nestings of modal operators, the implications of which are discussed later. But we are willing to give this up since in return, we get (for the first time) a very simple possible-world style account of multiagent only knowing. For the propositional subset, there is also a sound and complete axiomatization that faithfully generalizes Levesque's proof theory. Different from [12], we do not enrich the language any more than necessary (modal operators for each agent), and we do not make use of Kripke models. Interestingly, for the propositional subset, we establish a precise relationship with [12], and this shows that we avoid their problems in a reasonable manner. Finally, we obtain a first-order multiagent generalization of AEL, defined using notions of classical logical entailment, as an analogue to Levesque's result.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We are organized as follows. We begin by reviewing Levesque's logic of only knowing.{sup:3} Following [12], we then emphasize some salient features of only knowing. Next, we define a semantics for multiagent only knowing with so-called k-structures, and discuss how the salient features are captured in our framework. We then turn to an axiomatization in the propositional case, which is treated in two steps: we first discuss an axiomatization for a restricted fragment of the language, developed by Lakemeyer [10], and then show how that should be extended for the full language. We demonstrate our axiomatization using examples exhibiting nonmonotonicity. Next, we establish a relationship to [12], before turning to a multiagent version of AEL. Finally, we discuss related work and conclude.

     {a mathematical formula}OL: the logic of only knowing
     <paragraph>
      Levesque's logic {a mathematical formula}OL is a first-order modal dialect with equality and a countably infinite set of standard names, which are like constants syntactically but will also serve as the universe of discourse in the semantics.{sup:4} More precisely, the logical symbols of the language consist of the following sets:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="•">
       a countably infinite supply of (individual) variables, written as x, y, or z, possibly with subscripts or superscripts;
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="•">
       a countably infinite supply of standard names, written schematically as n or m, possibly with subscripts or superscripts;
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="•">
       the equality symbol, written =;
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="•">
       modal operators K and N;
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="•">
       the usual logical connectives {a mathematical formula}∀,∨,¬, parenthesis, and punctuation, such as comma and period.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Other connectives like ∧, ⊃, ≡, and ∃ are taken for their usual syntactic abbreviations.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The non-logical symbols of {a mathematical formula}OL consist of predicate symbols (of every arity), written schematically as P or Q, and intended to be domain specific properties and relations. To keep matters simple, function symbols are not considered in this language.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We call a predicate other than =, applied to first-order variables or standard names, an atomic formula or atom. A ground atom is an atom whose arguments are standard names only. We write {a mathematical formula}αnx to mean that all occurrences of the free variable x are substituted in α by standard name n. A formula without free variables is called a sentence. A formula not mentioning any modalities is called objective. A formula is called subjective if every atom is in the scope of a modality.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The semantics is defined wrt worlds, which are simply sets of ground atoms. The set of all possible worlds is denoted as {a mathematical formula}W. The standard names are thus rigid designators, and denote precisely the same entities in all worlds. An epistemic state e is any set of possible worlds over {a mathematical formula}W. A pair {a mathematical formula}(e,w), where w is a world and e an epistemic state, is called a model and the truth of sentences in {a mathematical formula}OL is defined as follows:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="1.">
       {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨p iff {a mathematical formula}p∈w for a ground atom p,
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="2.">
       {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨(m=n) iff m and n are identical standard names,
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="3.">
       {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨¬α iff {a mathematical formula}e,w⊭α,
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="4.">
       {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨α∨β iff {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨α or {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨β,
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="5.">
       {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨∀x.α iff {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨αnx for all standard names n,
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="6.">
       {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨Kα iff for all {a mathematical formula}w′∈e, {a mathematical formula}e,w′⊨α,
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="7.">
       {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨Nα iff for all {a mathematical formula}w′∉e, {a mathematical formula}e,w′⊨α.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      As mentioned earlier, we read {a mathematical formula}Kα as “at least α is believed.” Of course, this is the classical knowledge operator, and (at least) α is believed iff it is true at all worlds considered possible. We read {a mathematical formula}N¬α as “at most α is believed” since if the agent knows more than α, he would not consider all worlds where α holds epistemically possible. Thus, (at most) α is believed to be false iff it is true at all worlds considered impossible. Now we say that an agent only knows α, written {a mathematical formula}Oα, to mean:{a mathematical formula} where worlds in e are precisely those where α is true. That is,
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="•">
       {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨Oα iff for all {a mathematical formula}w′, {a mathematical formula}w′∈e iff {a mathematical formula}e,w′⊨α.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Note that the only difference to the semantics for K is that an “if” becomes an “iff”.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Validity and satisfiability are defined as usual, that is, a formula α is valid (⊨α) iff for every set of worlds e and every {a mathematical formula}w∈W, {a mathematical formula}e,w⊨α.{sup:5}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      It is not hard to show that {a mathematical formula}Oα⊃Kα is a valid sentence in {a mathematical formula}OL. Moreover, the operators K and N enjoy the usual properties of K45 modalities [1]. For example, both {a mathematical formula}Kα⊃KKα and {a mathematical formula}¬Nα⊃N¬Nα are valid sentences in {a mathematical formula}OL.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      As we mentioned earlier, for the propositional case the semantics can be understood in terms of the following proof theory:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Axioms:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item>
       A1. All instances of propositional logic,
      </list-item>
      <list-item>

       A5. {a mathematical formula}Nα⊃¬Kα if ¬α is a propositionally consistent objective formula.

     <paragraph>
      Inference Rules:

     <list>
      <list-item>

       NEC. From α infer {a mathematical formula}Kα and {a mathematical formula}Nα.{sup:6}
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Essentially, axioms {a mathematical formula}A2–A4 tell us that K and N separately have all properties of a K45 modal operator. In addition, the axiom A4 tells us that K and N are mutually introspective, that is, {a mathematical formula}Kα⊃NKα is valid. Perhaps, the most interesting axiom is A5 which establishes the connection between K and N, and gives O the desired properties.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Let us now conclude our review of {a mathematical formula}OL by focusing on three properties of the semantics outlined by [12], which should provide guidance when considering extensions to {a mathematical formula}OL:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item>
       Evaluating formulas of the form {a mathematical formula}Nα does not affect an agent's possibilities, i.e. the epistemic state e remains fixed.
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
       A union of the epistemically possible worlds in e, wrt which K is evaluated, and the impossible worlds, wrt which N is evaluated, is absolute and independent of e, and is the set of all conceivable worlds {a mathematical formula}W. The intuition is that the exact complement of an agent's possibilities is used in evaluating N.
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
       For every set of conceivable worlds, there is always a model where precisely this set is the epistemic state.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      A closer look informs us that P1 is essential for the soundness of A4 in Levesque's proof theory. Indeed, since this axiom makes {a mathematical formula}Kα⊃NKα valid, it follows that an epistemic state that interprets {a mathematical formula}Kα is also one where {a mathematical formula}NKα is true. P2 is essential for the soundness of A5 in Levesque's proof theory. This can be reasoned as follows. Suppose α is any non-valid formula and {a mathematical formula}Nα is satisfied in a model {a mathematical formula}(e,w). By axiom A5, {a mathematical formula}¬Kα is also true at {a mathematical formula}(e,w). That is, since α is true in all the impossible worlds, and since ¬α is satisfiable by assumption, there must be a possible world that satisfies ¬α. Therefore, α is not believed at {a mathematical formula}(e,w). Finally, P3 allows the possibility to only know any objective formula.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Interestingly, although these notions seem clear enough in the single agent case, generalizing them to the many agent case is non-trivial. Roughly speaking, the problem is that in the single agent case a possible state of affairs is simply captured by an objective formula, but that is no longer true in the multiagent case. When multiple agents are in the picture, a possibility, intuitively, should not only talk about what is true in the world but also about what others may believe. So p is just as objective in agent i's perspective as {a mathematical formula}Kjp (read: “j believes p”). Therefore, the appropriate generalization of possibility are i-objective formulas, by which we mean formulas such as p and {a mathematical formula}Kjp (defined formally below). We return to analyze the faithfulness of our approach wrt these properties after introducing a semantics in the next section.{sup:7}

      Multiagent only knowing
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      We begin by extending the language. Let {a mathematical formula}OLn be a first-order modal language that enriches the non-modal subset of {a mathematical formula}OL with modal operators {a mathematical formula}Ki and {a mathematical formula}Ni for each agent i. For ease of exposition, we only consider two agents A (Alice) and B (Bob), that is, let {a mathematical formula}i∈{A,B}. Extensions to more agents are straightforward. By analogy to the single agent case, we freely use {a mathematical formula}Oi, such that {a mathematical formula}Oiα abbreviates {a mathematical formula}Kiα∧Ni¬α, and is read as “all that i knows is α.” The terms objective and subjective are now understood relative to an agent i. A formula is called i-objective if all epistemic operators which do not occur within the scope of another epistemic operator are of the form {a mathematical formula}Mj for {a mathematical formula}i≠j, where M denotes K or N. A formula is called i-subjective if every atom is in the scope of an epistemic operator and all epistemic operators which do not occur within the scope of another epistemic operator are of the form {a mathematical formula}Mi. Intuitively, i-subjective formulas refer to what is true about i's beliefs about the world whereas i-objective formulas refer to what is true about the world from i's perspective, which may include beliefs about what other agents believe. We will continue to call a formula objective if it does not contain any modal operators. A formula is basic if it does not mention any {a mathematical formula}Ni for {a mathematical formula}i∈{A,B}.
     </paragraph>

      In the following it will be useful to refer to the degree of nestings of modal operators within a formula, where we lump together consecutive nestings of operators for the same agent.

       A semantics
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The purpose of a semantics is to interpret i-subjective and i-objective formulas. Knowledge in multiagent systems is traditionally modeled by means of a generalization of Kripke structures to n agents [1]; Fig. 1 depicts a simple structure of this sort. However, such structures do not share the simplicity of Levesque's semantical framework that treats worlds as truth valuations.{sup:8} Most significantly, as mentioned earlier, there do not seem to be natural ways to capture all the necessary features of multiagent only knowing in a first-order setting with such structures [9], [12].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Our approach will be based on a simple notion called k-structures, where the idea is to keep separate the worlds A believes from the worlds she considers B to believe, and so on, to k levels.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Formally, let the set of all possible worlds {a mathematical formula}W be defined exactly as before. Then:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 3">
       Given {a mathematical formula}k≥0, we define {a mathematical formula}Ek inductively:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="•">
        {a mathematical formula}E0={{}};

       <list-item label="•">
        {a mathematical formula}Ek=2W×Ek−1.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       Intuitively, a k-structure determines knowledge of depth k. For example, {a mathematical formula}e0 is an epistemic state where everything is (vacuously) believed. On the other hand, a (nonempty) {a mathematical formula}e1 is of the form {a mathematical formula}{(w,{}),(w′,{})} which describes an agent whose beliefs about the world are determined by w and {a mathematical formula}w′. However, such an agent is fully ignorant of what the other agent believes, and so has nothing interesting to say about the other agent. Analogously, a (nonempty) {a mathematical formula}e2 is a set of the form {a mathematical formula}{(w,e1),(w′,e′1),…} which states that at w an agent, say A, believes B to consider worlds from {a mathematical formula}e1 possible, and at {a mathematical formula}w′ she believes B to consider worlds from {a mathematical formula}e′1 possible; Fig. 2 depicts such an epistemic state for A. This captures the intuition that A has partial information about B, and so her beliefs about B differ at different worlds. In the sequel, we often drop the index and simply use e, when it is clear from the context.{sup:9}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       When modeling a k-structure, say {a mathematical formula}ek, for A we denote it as {a mathematical formula}eAk. Analogously, when modeling a j-structure, say {a mathematical formula}ej, for B we denote it as {a mathematical formula}eBj. We define a k-structure {a mathematical formula}ek for A, a j-structure {a mathematical formula}ej for B and a world w as a {a mathematical formula}(k,j)-model{a mathematical formula}(eAk,eBj,w).

       We now show that the validity of formulas of maximal {a mathematical formula}A,B-depth {a mathematical formula}k,j can be inspected in terms of {a mathematical formula}(k,j)-models alone, that is, no models of higher depths are necessary. More precisely, if a formula of maximal {a mathematical formula}A,B-depth {a mathematical formula}k,j is true at all {a mathematical formula}(k,j)-models, then the formula is also true at all {a mathematical formula}(k′,j′)-models, for {a mathematical formula}k′≥k and {a mathematical formula}j′≥j. To demonstrate this property, we construct for every {a mathematical formula}eAk′, a k-structure {a mathematical formula}eA↓kk′, such that they agree on all formulas of maximal A-depth k. Analogously, a j-structure that agrees on all formulas of maximal B-depth j can be constructed for every {a mathematical formula}eBj′.

      <paragraph>
       Having demonstrated this feature, let us for the moment reflect on the relation between a knowledge base and k-structures. Suppose A only knows Σ, of depth k. Using k-structures alone allows us to reason about what is believed and what is not believed, up to depth k. Moreover, as already observed in Example 10, the logic correctly captures that A is ignorant about beliefs at depth greater than k. That is, using the simple example of an agent who only knows TRUE of depth 1, we saw that both the sentences {a mathematical formula}OA(TRUE)⊃¬KA¬KBα and {a mathematical formula}OA(TRUE)⊃¬KAKBα are valid. So, although the KB has finite depth, we are able to ask queries α of any depth in the sense of determining whether {a mathematical formula}OiΣ⊃Kiα is valid.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For most purposes, this restriction of having a parameter k seems harmless in the sense that agents usually have a finite knowledge base with sentences of some maximal depth k and they should be ignorant about what is known at depths higher than k. But there is one aspect which we cannot handle: a knowledge base entailing positive beliefs of unbounded depth. One prominent instance of such a property is the notion of common knowledge. To illustrate the idea briefly, let us write {a mathematical formula}Eα to syntactically mean {a mathematical formula}KAα∧KBα. The intuitive reading of {a mathematical formula}Eα is that both A and B know α, that is, “everybody knows α”. Now, let {a mathematical formula}E0α be an abbreviation for α, and let {a mathematical formula}Ek+1 be an abbreviation for {a mathematical formula}EEkα. Then α is said to be common knowledge, written {a mathematical formula}Cα, if {a mathematical formula}Ekα for {a mathematical formula}k=1,2… . While the nature of C is infinitary, in the sense that it essentially corresponds to an infinite conjunction, it can nonetheless be given a finite axiomatic characterization [1], making it a useful operator for reasoning in distributed systems and games.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Thus, if we were to include the notion of common knowledge in a logic, then we would get entailments about what is known at arbitrary depths. With our current model, however, this cannot be captured.{sup:11} While this is certainly a restriction, we are willing to pay that price because in return we get, for the first time, a very simple possible-world style account of only knowing for many agents.

      Generalizing the features of {a mathematical formula}OL
      <paragraph>
       In this section, we intend to demonstrate that our semantics for {a mathematical formula}OLn generalizes the features of {a mathematical formula}OL, namely {a mathematical formula}P1–P3, in a suitable manner.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We begin by briefly summarizing the substantiation by earlier proposals. Lakemeyer [10] and Halpern [11] independently attempted to extend {a mathematical formula}OL to the many agent case. Both approaches provide a semantics by means of multiagent Kripke structures.{sup:12} There are some subtle differences in these proposals, but the main restriction is that they only allow a propositional language.{sup:13} Besides that, the model theory for these proposals has problems. For example, Lakemeyer's approach is based on a {a mathematical formula}K45ncanonical model, which is a Kripke structure whose worlds are all maximally consistent (wrt the axioms of the modal logic {a mathematical formula}K45n) subsets of basic formulas (cf.Definition 20). Canonical models are often criticized for being overly proof-theoretic since truth is based on the notion of consistency. So the approach is not “natural” in the usual sense where a semantics independently justifies truth in a logic. That notwithstanding, [12] further show that the analogue of P3 does not hold in the Lakemeyer proposal. Similarly, in the proposal by Halpern, the analogue of P2 does not hold. Consequently, these approaches show some peculiar properties, which we will look at shortly. Ergo, apart from their propositional restriction, they do not truly generalize {a mathematical formula}OL's properties. Henceforth, following [12], we will refer to the Lakemeyer proposal as the canonical model approach, and to the Halpern proposal as the i-set approach. (While the details of Halpern's proposal need not concern us here, it is based on the idea of constructing models where epistemic states correspond to sets of maximal i-objective formulas, or i-sets for short.)
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We will now show that in the first-order case, the analogues of all three properties hold in our proposal. The first item on the agenda is clarifying the notion of an epistemic possibility. As discussed earlier, the appropriate generalization of a possibility in the many agent case is a set of i-objective formulas. The question, then, is which set of i-objective formulas represent the epistemic possibilities of the agent? To answer that, we define the following:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 12">
       Suppose {a mathematical formula}M=(eAk,eBj,w) is a {a mathematical formula}(k,j)-model. We define {a mathematical formula}obji(M) as follows:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="1.">
        {a mathematical formula}objA(M)={A-objective ϕ of B-depth≤j|M⊨ϕ};

        {a mathematical formula}objB(M)={B-objective ϕ of A-depth≤k|M⊨ϕ}.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       To see the intuition behind the definition, suppose that we are interested in the set of A-objective formulas true at the model M. Clearly, the objective formulas true at w are to be included in this set, as are the B-subjective formulas that hold wrt the j-structure {a mathematical formula}eBj in M. Note that these formulas do not actually capture A's possibilities, which are, in fact, determined strictly by the k-structure {a mathematical formula}eAk. Hence, we define {a mathematical formula}ObjA(eAk) as the set of all A-objectives formulas that A considers possible, which is obtained from the set of all k-structures {a mathematical formula}(w,e)∈eAk. With this elaborated, let us look at the generalizations of {a mathematical formula}P1–P3:

       When a single agent is involved, this property ensures that epistemic possibilities are not affected when evaluating N. To see why this idea holds for {a mathematical formula}OLn in a straightforward manner, consider any model {a mathematical formula}M=(eAk,eBj,w). Then, A's possibilities are given as {a mathematical formula}ObjA(eAk). Now, to evaluate formulas of the form {a mathematical formula}NAα, we are interested in the set of models{a mathematical formula} Observe that A's possibilities in every {a mathematical formula}M′∈M are still given by {a mathematical formula}ObjA(eAk). Therefore, epistemic possibilities are not affected on evaluating {a mathematical formula}Ni.

      <paragraph>
       Generalizing P2:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Here we are concerned with the property that the evaluation of {a mathematical formula}Kiα and {a mathematical formula}Niα is wrt the set of all possibilities. Moreover, the set of all possibilities is independent of the epistemic state.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To demonstrate this property, let α be any A-objective formula, say of maximal B-depth k, which represents a possibility in A's view. Then let {a mathematical formula}eAk+1 be any epistemic state satisfying {a mathematical formula}KAα. By analogy to the single agent case, the set of models used to interpret {a mathematical formula}NAα must be the exact complement of {a mathematical formula}eAk+1, in the sense that these models together with {a mathematical formula}eAk+1 is the full set of conceivable states. Now since epistemic notions are defined wrt the depth of formulas, the set of conceivable states of depth {a mathematical formula}k+1 is {a mathematical formula}Ek+1. It is then easy to show that wrt {a mathematical formula}Ek+1, structures considered for the interpretation of {a mathematical formula}KAα and {a mathematical formula}NAα are truly complements of each other. Moreover, {a mathematical formula}Ek+1 is independent of {a mathematical formula}eAk+1.

      <paragraph label="Proposition 13">
       Let α be A-objective of B-depth k. Then, the set of{a mathematical formula}(k+1)-structures that evaluate{a mathematical formula}KAαand{a mathematical formula}NAαis{a mathematical formula}Ek+1. (Analogously stated for B.)

       Generalizing P3:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The third property, by analogy to the single agent case, must allow us to characterize epistemic states from any set of i-objective formulas. Intuitively, given such a set of formulas, we must have a model where precisely this set represents the beliefs of an epistemic state.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       A proof-theoretic strategy to proving this property consists of showing that there is an epistemic state corresponding to every set of maximally consistent sets of formulas [12]. This arises from the observation that every set of formulas can be extended to a maximally consistent set of formulas, and so the strategy proves P3. However, this is fraught with difficulty in a first-order setting. We have, for one, no clear understanding of what the axiom system should look like in the first-order case even for a single agent [9].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The alternative is to consider a purely semantic notion of a complete description of a possibility, analogous to the proof-theoretically characterized notion of a maximally consistent set of formulas. That is, we consider the equivalent notion of a maximally satisfiable set of formulas. More precisely, let Σ be a satisfiable set of A-objective (not necessarily basic) formulas, of maximal B-depth k. Let γ be any A-objective formula such that {a mathematical formula}|γ|B≤k. If {a mathematical formula}Σ∪{γ} is satisfiable, then let {a mathematical formula}Σ1=Σ∪{γ}. Otherwise, let {a mathematical formula}Σ1=Σ. By considering all A-objective formulas of maximal B-depth k, construct {a mathematical formula}Σ2,… , iteratively and let {a mathematical formula}Σ⁎ be the limit. We term a set of formulas constructed in this fashion as an A-set of B-depth k. (There may be many A-sets corresponding to Σ depending on our choice of γ and the subsequent formulas added.)
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We now show that given any set of i-sets of a certain depth, there is a model where precisely this set characterizes the epistemic state.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 14">
       Let σ be a satisfiable objective formula,{a mathematical formula}SAany set of A-sets of B-depth k, and{a mathematical formula}SBany set of B-sets of A-depth j.

      <paragraph label="Proof">

Let{a mathematical formula} It is immediate to verify that {a mathematical formula}ObjA(e⁎Ak+1)=SA. In an analogous fashion construct {a mathematical formula}e⁎Bj+1 from {a mathematical formula}SB.

      <paragraph>
       To summarize, generalized variants of Levesque's properties are satisfied in the semantical framework. To add further support to this claim, we now present the unintuitive properties exhibited by the canonical model and the i-set approaches. Meanwhile, we show that our approach does not suffer from these problems.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Lakemeyer [10] noted that certain types of epistemic states cannot be constructed in his approach. This is a consequence of the approach not satisfying P3. More precisely,

      <paragraph label="Proposition 15">
       (See[10].) For any proposition p and{a mathematical formula}i≠j,{a mathematical formula}¬Oi¬Ojpis valid in the canonical model approach.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       {a mathematical formula}OA¬OBp says that all that Alice knows is that Bob does not only know p. Lakemeyer [10] admits that the validity of {a mathematical formula}¬OA¬OBp is unintuitive because after all, Bob could honestly tell Alice that he does not only know p. The main reason for this peculiarity, it turns out, is that by proposing a semantics based on {a mathematical formula}K45n canonical models, agents only entertain basic i-objective possibilities. In contrast, we show that {a mathematical formula}¬Oi¬Ojp is not valid in our approach. This is a consequence of Theorem 14 that shows that P3 holds.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 16">
       For any proposition p and{a mathematical formula}i≠j,{a mathematical formula}Oi¬Ojpis satisfiable (in a model of appropriate depth).

       Let i be A. (The argument is symmetric if i is B.) Let {a mathematical formula}Wp={(w,{})|w⊨p} and let {a mathematical formula}E=E1−{Wp}.

Then {a mathematical formula}eA2,{},w⊨OA¬OBp. □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       While the i-set approach satisfies P3 because of which the satisfiability of {a mathematical formula}Oi¬Ojp can also be confirmed for the framework, it does not satisfy P2. In fact, it can be shown that:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 17">

      <paragraph>
       Recall that P2 requires the evaluation of {a mathematical formula}Kiα and {a mathematical formula}Niα to consider all conceivable states. In effect, the satisfiability of the above sentence leaves open the question as to why {a mathematical formula}Ojp is not considered since {a mathematical formula}¬Ojp is true at all conceivable states. We now prove that the sentence is not satisfiable wrt our semantics:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 18">
       For any proposition p and{a mathematical formula}i≠j,{a mathematical formula}Ni¬Ojp∧Ki¬Ojpis not satisfiable.

       Let i be A, with the other case being symmetric. Suppose {a mathematical formula}eAk,{},w⊨KA¬OBp for any w. Then for all {a mathematical formula}(w′,e)∈eAk, {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w′⊨¬OBp. Since {a mathematical formula}OBp is satisfiable, there is an {a mathematical formula}e⁎ such that {a mathematical formula}{},e⁎,w″⊨OBp for any {a mathematical formula}w″. By assumption {a mathematical formula}(w″,e⁎)∉eAk. Therefore {a mathematical formula}eAk,{},w⊨¬NA¬OBp. □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       With the i-set approach the problem seems to be that {a mathematical formula}Ki and {a mathematical formula}Ni do not interact naturally, and that the full complement of epistemic possibilities is not considered in interpreting {a mathematical formula}Ni. However, since a semantics with k-structures faithfully complies with P2, we get that {a mathematical formula}NA¬OBp∧KA¬OBp is not satisfiable, as should be the case. This concludes the justifications about the appropriateness of the semantics.

      Proof theory
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Naturally, the next question is if there are axioms that characterize the semantics in the propositional case. We show that the answer is affirmative. However, obtaining such an axiomatization is not entirely straightforward. Let us begin by recalling Levesque's proof theory from Section 2, and taking notice, in particular, of the following axiom:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item>
       A5. {a mathematical formula}Nα⊃¬Kα if ¬α is a propositionally consistent objective formula.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Note that the soundness of A5 appeals to falsifiability in classical propositional logic. Precisely for this reason, generalizing only that axiom is problematic. Basically, for the multiagent case, we have to extend the applicability of this axiom from consistent objective formulas to consistent i-objective formulas. Unfortunately, establishing the consistency of i-objective formulas is non-trivial and even circular, since to have a notion of consistency implies that we have already defined an axiom system.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      To this end, Lakemeyer [10] proposes to resolve the circularity by appealing to the existing logic {a mathematical formula}K45n. That is, his variant of a generalized A5 is the axiom {a mathematical formula}Niα⊃¬Kiα, where α is any formula that is falsifiable in (classical) {a mathematical formula}K45n. Of course, this means that he has to restrict his attention to basic formulas.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Axioms:

      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Clearly, Lakemeyer has appropriately generalized all of Levesque's axioms, except for A5. Let us refer to the above set of schemas as {a mathematical formula}AXn. But one significant consequence of restricting to basic formulas in {a mathematical formula}A5n is that {a mathematical formula}AXn is not complete for formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLn. However, {a mathematical formula}AXn is sound and complete for a sublanguage {a mathematical formula}OLn−⊊OLn wrt both the canonical model and the i-set approach, which is defined as follows:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 19">
      {a mathematical formula}OLn− consists of all formulas α in {a mathematical formula}OLn such that no {a mathematical formula}Nj may occur in the scope of a {a mathematical formula}Ki or an {a mathematical formula}Ni, for {a mathematical formula}i≠j.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      For example, {a mathematical formula}NAKA¬NAp is in {a mathematical formula}OLn−, but {a mathematical formula}NANBp is not. In particular, this precludes us from deriving properties of sentences such as {a mathematical formula}OAOBp.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We now show that {a mathematical formula}AXn is sound and complete for formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLn− wrt our semantics as well. We shall then leverage that result to obtain a proof theory for the full language.
     </paragraph>
     <section label="4.1">
      {a mathematical formula}AXn is complete for {a mathematical formula}OLn−
      <paragraph>
       The soundness of {a mathematical formula}A5n appeals to consistency wrt {a mathematical formula}K45n. But precisely because our semantics is not formulated using Kripke structures, stating that {a mathematical formula}K45n-consistent formulas are satisfiable is not immediate. Therefore we propose a construction known as a correspondence model. Intuitively, a correspondence model is a {a mathematical formula}(k,j)-model obtained from a given Kripke structure. It is a well-known property in modal logic that every consistent formula is satisfiable in the canonical model [16]. Therefore our idea will be to show that if a formula (of a certain depth) is satisfiable in the canonical model then it is also satisfiable in an appropriate correspondence model, and vice versa.

      <paragraph>
       For this section, since we will need to deal with worlds as considered by Levesque on one hand, and Kripke worlds on the other we refer to the former as propositional valuations. Let us begin by recalling the notion of a canonical model [16]:

       That is, a correspondence model constructs epistemic states by appealing to the accessibility relations in the canonical Kripke structure. For instance, a 1-structure for A has precisely those propositional valuations corresponding to the worlds {a mathematical formula}{w′|w′∈KAc(w)}. Analogously, a k-structure is the set of all {a mathematical formula}({an inline-figure},ek−1), where {a mathematical formula}w′∈KAc(w) as before and {a mathematical formula}ek−1 for {a mathematical formula}k&gt;0 is constructed inductively (to the appropriate depth) from all {a mathematical formula}w″∈KBc(w′).

       To show that {a mathematical formula}AXn is also complete for formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLn−, it suffices to show that every {a mathematical formula}AXn-consistent formula is satisfiable. We simplify this treatment by appealing to a result by Halpern and Lakemeyer [12] who prove that every formula {a mathematical formula}α∈OLn is equivalent to one in a certain normal form, which we call NF. Our idea, then, will be to reduce every {a mathematical formula}AXn-consistent formula to one in NF and use its simple structure to prove that it is indeed satisfiable.{sup:14}

       It is sufficient to prove that every {a mathematical formula}AXn-consistent formula α is satisfiable. Let us reduce α to one in NF, as in Lemma 26, that is, to a disjunction of formulas of the form:{a mathematical formula} where σ is a propositional formula, and {a mathematical formula}ϕiz,ψiz are basic i-objective formulas (since {a mathematical formula}α∈OLn−). The idea will be to show that α in NF is satisfiable in some {a mathematical formula}(k′,j′)-model.Suppose {a mathematical formula}{ϕA0,ψA0,ϕAz,ψAz}, {a mathematical formula}z≥1 are of maximal B-depth k. Let {a mathematical formula}ΓA be the set of all {a mathematical formula}K45n-consistent basic A-objective formulas of the form {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧ψA0∧¬ϕAz or {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧ψA0∧¬ψAz, {a mathematical formula}z≥1. Let γ be a basic A-objective formula independent (wrt {a mathematical formula}K45n) of all formulas in {a mathematical formula}ΓA, which exists by way of Lemma 28. Since the formulas in {a mathematical formula}ΓA are of maximal B-depth k, then note that such a γ by way of the construction from Lemma 28 is of B-depth {a mathematical formula}2k+2. By only considering A-objective basic formulas of maximal B-depth k, let {a mathematical formula}ΣA be the set of all consistent sets of formulas containing {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧(¬ψA0∨(ψA0∧γ)).Since each {a mathematical formula}Σ′∈ΣA is basic and A-objective, they are satisfiable by Corollary 24. Let{a mathematical formula} We now show that the A-subjective formulas in the normal form are satisfiable wrt {a mathematical formula}eA2k+3:

For suppose not. Then {a mathematical formula}¬ϕA0∨ϕAz is provable. Therefore {a mathematical formula}KAϕA0⊃KAϕAz is provable, which contradicts the consistency of {a mathematical formula}KAϕA0∧¬KAϕAz. Now given that {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧¬ϕAz is consistent, it follows that either {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧¬ϕAz∧ψA0 or {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧¬ϕAz∧¬ψA0 is consistent. When the former, by the choice of γ, we also have that {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧¬ϕAz∧ψA0∧γ is consistent. Since {a mathematical formula}ΣA consists of all consistent sets containing {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧(¬ψA0∨(ψA0∧γ)), it follows that there is a {a mathematical formula}Σ′∈ΣA containing {a mathematical formula}¬ϕAz.

In addition, either {a mathematical formula}ψA0∧¬ψAz∧ϕA0 or {a mathematical formula}ψA0∧¬ψAz∧¬ϕA0 must be consistent.

      {a mathematical formula}AXn is not complete for {a mathematical formula}OLn
      <paragraph>
       The soundness of {a mathematical formula}AXn in Theorem 25 is easily lifted for all formulas {a mathematical formula}α∈OLn. The only interesting case is the {a mathematical formula}A5n schema. But because the application of the schema is restricted to basic formulas, the argument given holds immediately also for {a mathematical formula}OLn. To show that {a mathematical formula}AXn is not a complete axiomatization, we simply need to find a formula in {a mathematical formula}OLn such that it is valid but not provable using {a mathematical formula}AXn.

      <paragraph>
       However, it is not possible to prove this formula using {a mathematical formula}AXn[12, see Theorem 4.7]. Therefore {a mathematical formula}AXn is not complete for formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLn. The validity of the non-provable formula {a mathematical formula}¬Oi¬Ojp∈OLn wrt the canonical model approach demonstrates in a similar spirit that {a mathematical formula}AXn is also not a complete axiomatization in that approach.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Part of the problem is {a mathematical formula}A5n. It has to somehow go beyond basic formulas. But this is a problem of circularity. On the one hand, we would need {a mathematical formula}Niα⊃¬Kiα to hold for any consistent i-objective α. On the other, to deal with consistency we have to clarify and define an axiom system.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The approach taken by Halpern and Lakemeyer [12] is to introduce the semantic notion of validity, and the dual notion of satisfiability, into the language as modal operators. The motivation is that, by syntactically representing satisfiability, the notion of consistency can be inductively defined from propositional formulas to modal ones. Not surprisingly, a new set of axioms is needed to characterize this feature, by way of which the axiomatization is significantly different from Levesque's formulation for the single agent case. We give the details in the next section but for now let us refer to their axiomatic proposal as {a mathematical formula}AXn′.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Halpern and Lakemeyer show that the axioms {a mathematical formula}AXn′ characterize an infinite model, very much in the spirit of the canonical model from Definition 20. There are differences to Definition 20, however. First, the worlds are defined as maximally consistent {a mathematical formula}AXn′-consistent formulas. Second, {a mathematical formula}Ki and {a mathematical formula}Ni are treated as separate modal operators, which results in two separate accessibility relations. Owing to this difference, the model is referred to as the extended canonical model.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       One approach towards an axiomatization for our semantics is to perhaps show that valid formulas wrt our approach coincides with the extended canonical model. But having to axiomatize validity does not seem natural. One of the principal reasons for axiomatic formulations is to have an insightful view on valid formulas in a logic, independent of semantic notions. Further, the proof theory is difficult to use. Lastly, we would still understand the axioms to characterize a semantics bridged on proof-theoretic elements.

       The proof is by an induction on t. It is sufficient to prove that every {a mathematical formula}AXnt-consistent formula α is satisfiable. The base case, i.e. when t is 1, is already established in Theorem 30. For the induction hypothesis, assume that every {a mathematical formula}AXnt−1-consistent formula {a mathematical formula}α∈OLnt−1 is satisfiable.Suppose {a mathematical formula}α∈OLnt is {a mathematical formula}AXnt-consistent. Without any loss of generality, let us suppose that it is in NF, as in Lemma 26.{sup:16} That is, α is equivalent to a disjunction of formulas of the form{a mathematical formula} where σ is a propositional formula and {a mathematical formula}ϕiz,ψiz for {a mathematical formula}z≥1 are i-objective (not necessarily basic) formulas. Further, by the definition of {a mathematical formula}OLnt, {a mathematical formula}ϕiz,ψiz∈OLnt−1.The remainder of the proof uses formal ideas similar to the ones used in Theorem 30, the only exception being that we do not restrict our attention to basic formulas. Suppose now {a mathematical formula}{ϕA0,ψA0,ϕAz,ψAz} are of maximal B-depth k. Then, let {a mathematical formula}ΓA be the set of all {a mathematical formula}AXnt−1-consistent A-objective formulas of the form {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧ψA0∧¬ϕAz or {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧ψA0∧¬ψAz, {a mathematical formula}z≥1. Let γ be a formula that is independent of all formulas in {a mathematical formula}ΓA, which exists by way of Lemma 35. As in Lemma 28, there is a formula γ whose maximal B-depth is {a mathematical formula}2k+2.Now, only using A-objective formulas of maximal B-depth k, let {a mathematical formula}ΣA be the set of all {a mathematical formula}AXnt−1-consistent sets of formulas containing {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧(¬ψA0∨(ψA0∧γ)). By the induction hypothesis, each {a mathematical formula}Σ′∈ΣA is satisfiable. Then let{a mathematical formula} We claim that all the A-subjective formulas in α (in NF) are satisfied wrt {a mathematical formula}eA2k+3. An analogous construction of an epistemic state for B satisfies the B-subjective formulas in α. Finally, a world {a mathematical formula}w⁎ satisfies the consistent propositional formula σ by definition. Thus a model for α is found. We only prove the case of {a mathematical formula}¬KAϕAz below, since the argument for the other cases is pursued in the same fashion as done in Theorem 30.

Further, since {a mathematical formula}ϕA0,ϕAz∈OLnt−1, the formula must be consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt−1. For if not, they cannot by definition be consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt. This means that either {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧¬ϕAz∧ψA0 or {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧¬ϕAz∧¬ψA0 is consistent. If the former is consistent, then so is {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧¬ϕAz∧ψA0∧γ. Since {a mathematical formula}ΣA consists of all {a mathematical formula}AXnt−1-consistent sets of formulas containing {a mathematical formula}ϕA0∧(¬ψA0∨(ψA0∧γ)), there is clearly a {a mathematical formula}Σ′∈ΣA such that {a mathematical formula}¬ϕAz∈Σ′.

       Thus, we have a sound and complete axiomatization for propositional {a mathematical formula}OLn. In comparison to Lakemeyer's proof theory {a mathematical formula}AXn, the current axiomatization goes beyond a language that restricts the nesting of {a mathematical formula}Ni. In contrast to Halpern and Lakemeyer [12], the axiomatization does not necessitate the use of semantic notions in the proof theory. In the next section, we consider examples of formal derivations with our proof theory.

      <paragraph>
       As a closing remark, let us draw comparisons to one other attempt to capture multiagent only knowing. An axiomatization by Waaler [13] considers an interesting alternative to deal with the circularity in a generalized A5. The idea is to first define consistency by formulating a fragment of the axiom system in the sequent calculus. Quite analogous to having t-axioms, they allow us to apply the {a mathematical formula}Nivs.{a mathematical formula}Ki relationship on i-objective formulas of a lower depth, thereby avoiding circularity without the need to appeal to satisfiability as in [12]. Interestingly, Waaler shows that provability in the Halpern and Lakemeyer system, to be discussed in Section 4.5, coincides with his [13, Theorem 15]. Building on this, in later work, Waaler and Solhaug [14] then define a semantics for multiagent only knowing which does not appeal to canonical models. Instead, they define a class of Kripke structures which need to satisfy certain constraints. Unfortunately, these constraints are quite involved and, as the authors admit, the nature of these models “is complex and hard to penetrate.”

       Axiomatizing validity
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       We already discussed that both [10] and [11] fail to capture the intuitions of multiagent only knowing. Besides, Lakemeyer's proof theory is restricted to formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLn−. Extending this work, Halpern and Lakemeyer [12] proposed a multiagent only knowing logic that does handle the nesting of {a mathematical formula}Ni operators. However, as discussed, there are two undesirable features. The first is a semantics based on canonical models, and the second is a proof theory that axiomatizes validity. Although such a construction is far from natural, we now show that they do indeed capture the desired properties of only knowing. More precisely, we show that this proposal and our framework agree on provable formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLn. This mainly instructs us that our axiomatization avoids such problems in a reasonable manner.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We begin by presenting the essential formal features of their approach. More precisely, this involves enriching {a mathematical formula}OLn with a new modal operator V, for validity. We read {a mathematical formula}Vα as “α is valid”. A modal operator S, for satisfiability, is freely used such that {a mathematical formula}S(α) syntactically denotes {a mathematical formula}¬V(¬α). Let {a mathematical formula}OLn+ be the addition of V to {a mathematical formula}OLn.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To handle the circularity of consistency, Halpern and Lakemeyer propose an axiom system, which we will denote as {a mathematical formula}AXn′, that has the following set of schemas:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>

      <paragraph>
       The axioms may seem somewhat mysterious but intuitively, they allow us to extend the notion of consistency from propositional formulas to modal ones. To see this, consider the axiom V2 which allows us to include satisfiable propositional formulas in the scope of S. V3 then allows us to construct consistent i-subjective formulas from i-objective ones. Note also that the generalized A5 in this proof theory is {a mathematical formula}A5n′. This then allows us to invoke the {a mathematical formula}Nivs. {a mathematical formula}Ki relationship on all falsifiable i-objective formulas, that is, the formulas α for which {a mathematical formula}S(¬α) is provable from the given premises. The axiom V1 and the inference rule {a mathematical formula}NECV make the modality V a normal modal operator[16].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We mentioned in Section 4.2 that {a mathematical formula}AXn′ characterizes the extended canonical model. We do not present the details of this structure here since we will not directly make use of it.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In order to enable comparisons with the {a mathematical formula}AXn′ approach, it seems obvious that we need to extend our logic to handle the enriched language {a mathematical formula}OLn+.{sup:17} However, it turns out that there is a much simpler alternative, which rests on the following result proved by Halpern and Lakemeyer:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 41">
       (See[12].) Every formula{a mathematical formula}α∈OLn+is provably equivalent (wrt{a mathematical formula}AXn′) to some formula{a mathematical formula}α′∈OLn.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The theorem essentially tells us that as far as we are concerned regarding derivations of {a mathematical formula}AXn′, it suffices to restrict our attention to the language {a mathematical formula}OLn. Now, to obtain a correspondence between the two axiom systems, we first demonstrate that {a mathematical formula}S(α), where {a mathematical formula}α∈OLnt, is provable by {a mathematical formula}AXn′ iff α is consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt. This will then allow us to use Theorem 41 to establish the agreement on provable formulas.

      <paragraph label="Proposition 42">

       If {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(σ), {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(ζ) and {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(ξ), we can use V4 to get {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(σ∧ζ) because σ is A-objective and ζ is A-subjective. We can then use V4 again to get {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(σ∧ζ∧ξ), because ξ is B-subjective and {a mathematical formula}σ∧ζ is B-objective.For the other direction, since {a mathematical formula}AXn′ characterizes Kripke structures [12, Corollary 5.4], and because S corresponds to satisfiability, it follows that if {a mathematical formula}σ∧ζ∧ξ is satisfiable then {a mathematical formula}σ,ζ and ξ must be individually satisfiable. □

       As discussed in Lemma 26, {a mathematical formula}K45n and {a mathematical formula}AXn are able to reduce any α to one in the provably equivalent NF[12]. That is, let α be a disjunction of formulas {a mathematical formula}αu that are of the form {a mathematical formula}σ∧ζ∧ξ:{a mathematical formula} where σ is a propositional formula, and {a mathematical formula}ϕi,φi are i-objective formulas. The proof is by an induction on t.For the base case, we consider {a mathematical formula}α∈OLn−. In [12, Theorem 5.5], it is proven that for {a mathematical formula}α∈OLn−, {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢α iff {a mathematical formula}AXn⊢α. It follows, then, α is consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXn iff α is consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXn′ iff {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(α)[12, Proposition 5.1]. So assume the theorem holds for {a mathematical formula}α∈OLnt−1.We prove the claim for {a mathematical formula}OLnt as follows:{a mathematical formula}

       <paragraph>
        σ is propositional, {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(σ) iff σ is consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt (by the base case). We now prove that {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(ζ) iff ζ is consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt. Essentially, as we have seen earlier in Theorem 37, consistency of ζ holds iff {a mathematical formula}ϕ0∧ϕz,z≥1 and {a mathematical formula}ψ0∧ψz′,z′≥1 are consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt while {a mathematical formula}¬ϕ0∧¬ψ0 is not {a mathematical formula}AXnt-consistent iff by induction (because {a mathematical formula}ϕi,ψi∈OLnt−1): {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢⋀S(ϕ0∧ϕz), {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢⋀S(ψ0∧ψz′) and {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢V(ϕ0∨ψ0), i.e.{a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(ζ) by V3. By symmetric arguments, we can show that {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(ξ) iff ξ is consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt.Continuing from above, we then have:{a mathematical formula}

       This allows us to obtain the main result of the section:

       Suppose {a mathematical formula}AXnt⊢α and {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊬α. We prove by contradiction. Proposition 5.1 in [12] states that if α is not provable from {a mathematical formula}AXn′, then {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢¬V(α), i.e.{a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢S(¬α). But by assumption, ¬α is not consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt. Then {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊬S(¬α) because of Theorem 44. This is a contradiction.Conversely, suppose {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢α. Then by {a mathematical formula}NECV, it follows that {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢V(α), and so {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢¬S(¬α). Thus, {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊬S(¬α). Thus, ¬α is not consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt by Theorem 44. Therefore, {a mathematical formula}AXnt⊢α. □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Recall the main message of Theorem 41: it is sufficient to restrict ourselves to formulas from {a mathematical formula}OLn with regards to the Halpern and Lakemeyer approach. Therefore, Theorem 45 establishes an exact correspondence between the Halpern and Lakemeyer approach and our approach, without any of their problems.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Halpern and Lakemeyer also prove that deciding if {a mathematical formula}AXn′⊢α is PSPACE-complete [12, Theorem 5.6]. And so, as an immediate corollary, we inherit this complexity analysis:

       Finally, as mentioned earlier, Waaler's [13] proof system coincides with {a mathematical formula}AXn′ in terms of provable sentences [13, Theorem 15]. Thus, Theorem 45 further establishes an exact correspondence to Waaler's axiomatic proposal as well.

      Generalizing autoepistemic logic
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Levesque related only knowing to the notion of stable sets and stable expansions, which are the basis for AEL [8]. Stable sets and expansions, in a certain sense, rationally reconstruct perfect introspection via meta-theoretic arguments. But besides the independent semantical account to nonmonotonicity in a monotonic framework, Levesque also generalizes Moore's account to a quantificational language with equality.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      While [10], [11], and [12] propose a many agent extension to Moore's AEL, they remain propositional. In the sequel, we consider an analogue to Levesque's result, and propose a multiagent quantificational generalization of AEL. By means of the results we establish, for example, it is possible to consider the following KB:{a mathematical formula} to prove that {a mathematical formula}OAKB⊃KA¬KBSecret(p) is valid in {a mathematical formula}OLn while equivalently {a mathematical formula}KA¬KBSecret(p) belongs to the A-stable expansions of KB, where i-stable expansions are a generalization of Moore's stable expansions to many agents.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Let us begin by capturing the basic beliefs of k-structures:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 48">
      The (basic) belief set of a k-structure {a mathematical formula}eAk is the set of formulas{a mathematical formula} The notion is analogous for a j-structure {a mathematical formula}eBj. □
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      It is worth noting that the belief set of {a mathematical formula}eAk is of maximal A-depth k. This is significant because we now establish the connection between belief sets and stable sets, and the latter, technically speaking, is not bound to any depth. Therefore we restrict i-stable sets to a certain depth k as follows:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 49">
      i-stable sets restricted to a depth kSuppose Γ is a set of basic sentences such that {a mathematical formula}|Γ|i≤k. Γ is called i-stable iff

       If {a mathematical formula}α∉Γ, where {a mathematical formula}|α|i≤k, then {a mathematical formula}¬Kiα∈Γ. □
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Besides the depth restrictions, this definition differs from the one due to Moore. Mainly, for item 1 he uses propositional consequence since he only deals with a propositional language. The definition also differs from the one given by Levesque in that he restricts himself to first-order consequences (i.e. objective entailments only), but we are allowing modal entailments by way of consequences wrt ⊨. This is necessary in the multiagent case because if A believes {a mathematical formula}¬KBα then we require that he also believes {a mathematical formula}KB¬KBα since he attributes perfect introspective capabilities to B. However, this is not necessary in the single agent case because perfect introspection is already captured in the definition of a stable set. Basic belief sets and i-stable sets are related as follows:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Theorem 50">
      Suppose Γ is a set of basic sentences and{a mathematical formula}|Γ|i≤k. Then Γ is i-stable iff Γ is a basic belief set of a k-structure for agent i.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Proof">
      The if direction is immediate. The first condition from Definition 49 is the result of a logical reasoner, and the others are a result of an introspective reasoner.Conversely, let us suppose that Γ is i-stable. There are two cases:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item>
       Γ is satisfiable: By construction {a mathematical formula}|Γ|A≤k. By assumption suppose {a mathematical formula}eAk,eBj,w⊨Γ. If {a mathematical formula}α∈Γ then {a mathematical formula}KAα∈Γ and therefore {a mathematical formula}eAk,eBj,w⊨KAα. If {a mathematical formula}α∉Γ then {a mathematical formula}¬KAα∈Γ and therefore {a mathematical formula}eAk,eBj,w⊨¬KAα. That is, for every basic α, {a mathematical formula}α∈Γ iff {a mathematical formula}eAk,eBj,w⊨KAα. This implies that Γ is the basic belief set of {a mathematical formula}eAk.
      </list-item>
      <list-item>
       Γ is unsatisfiable: Clearly now {a mathematical formula}Γ⊨α for every basic formula α provided {a mathematical formula}|α|A≤k. Among other things, this implies that {a mathematical formula}Γ⊨p∧¬p for every atom p. Thus {a mathematical formula}KA(p∧¬p)∈Γ. Thus Γ is the basic belief set of a k-structure that is empty at all depths. □
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      We now turn to i-stable expansions, where we will be making similar depth restrictions. Intuitively, the stable expansion of a set of basic sentences S is a stable set containing all formulas that follow from S using logical reasoning and introspection:

     <paragraph label="Definition 51">

     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      To relate only knowing and stable expansions, Levesque's idea was to show that the stable expansion of a basic formula α is precisely the basic belief set of a maximal epistemic state where α is only known. In essence, a maximal set is the largest set in the sense that adding any other world to it would change the agent's beliefs. One has to assume that epistemic states are maximal because we can have two epistemic states that are identical as far as basic beliefs go, but they might not agree on only knowing.{sup:18} We will do a similar move here:

      First, let us define a set Σ as:{a mathematical formula} Let us note that because {a mathematical formula}|Γ|A≤k, {a mathematical formula}|Σ|A≤k as well. Now the theorem can be equivalently formulated as demonstrating{a mathematical formula} That is, since Γ corresponds to the belief set of {a mathematical formula}eAk, {a mathematical formula}M⊨KAβ for every {a mathematical formula}β∈Γ. Likewise, since {a mathematical formula}α∪Σ capture the notion of a stable expansion, {a mathematical formula}{α}∪Σ⊨β for every {a mathematical formula}β∈Γ.Suppose that {a mathematical formula}M⊨OAα. Assume the “if” part, i.e.{a mathematical formula}{α}∪Σ⊨β. Consider any {a mathematical formula}(w′,e)∈eAk. Clearly {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w′⊨α. Since Σ is A-subjective, {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w′⊨Σ∧α. Therefore {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w′⊨β. Thus for any {a mathematical formula}(w′,e)∈eAk, {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w′⊨β implying that {a mathematical formula}M⊨KAβ.Conversely, assume instead {a mathematical formula}M⊨KAβ. We must show that {a mathematical formula}{α}∪Σ⊨β. Let {a mathematical formula}(e′Ak,e,w′) be any model of {a mathematical formula}{α}∪Σ. By means of Lemma 5, Lemma 6, Lemma 7, we can assume {a mathematical formula}(w′,e)∈Ek without any loss of generality. Now let {a mathematical formula}e+ be the maximal state corresponding to {a mathematical formula}e′Ak, in accordance with Definition 52. By means of Proposition 53, {a mathematical formula}e+,e,w′⊨α∧Σ. Since {a mathematical formula}e+ and {a mathematical formula}eAk satisfy the same belief set and they are both maximal, and {a mathematical formula}e+=eAk by Corollary 55. In effect, {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w′⊨{α}. But this must mean {a mathematical formula}(w′,e)∈eAk since {a mathematical formula}eAk contains all structures satisfying α by the maximality assumption. Now, since β is believed in {a mathematical formula}eAk by assumption, {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w′⊨β. So any model of {a mathematical formula}{α}∪Σ satisfies β which implies that {a mathematical formula}{α}∪Σ⊨β.Suppose instead {a mathematical formula}M⊨KAβ iff {a mathematical formula}{α}∪Σ⊨β. We first demonstrate that if {a mathematical formula}(w′,e)∈eAk, then {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w′⊨α. This is obvious since {a mathematical formula}{α}∪Σ⊨α and therefore by assumption {a mathematical formula}M⊨KAα which implies {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w′⊨α. We now demonstrate that for any {a mathematical formula}(w″,e′)∈Ek if {a mathematical formula}eAk,e′,w″⊨α then {a mathematical formula}(w″,e′)∈eAk. This would then imply that {a mathematical formula}M⊨OAα. So suppose {a mathematical formula}eAk,e′,w″⊨α. Since Σ is A-subjective, {a mathematical formula}eAk,e′,w″⊨Σ∧α. Let β be any basic formula such that {a mathematical formula}{α}∪Σ⊨β. Then {a mathematical formula}eAk,e′,w″⊨β. But by assumption, {a mathematical formula}eAk,e′,w″⊨KAβ as well. Since {a mathematical formula}eAk is maximal, it follows that {a mathematical formula}(w″,e′)∈eAk. □

      Levesque was able to show that for a given (unbounded) stable expansion of α there is a unique e whose basic beliefs coincide with the expansion, and where α is all that is known. Our variant is slightly weaker in that way, because we can only consider expansions of a finite depth owing to the fact that our models are defined only for formulas of bounded depth. Nevertheless, we do get an analogous result about only knowing and stable expansions under depth considerations. We summarize the correspondences established in Table 1.

      In this work, we were concerned with the logic of only knowing, and its generalization to a multiagent case. There are two major strands of work, the first on formal models of knowledge with notions similar to only knowing, and the second on multiagent flavors of nonmonotonicity, and we discuss both below.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      First, let us begin by considering logics of knowledge and belief. This is a fundamental area of research; although instigated by philosophers, it has since found applications in computer science, game theory and artificial intelligence [1]. The question as to which axioms for knowledge are appropriate has been a cause for discussion [17], but K45 and S5 are perhaps the most used in knowledge representation. Multiagent logics of knowledge have also received considerable attention [18]. Here, extensions to logics like {a mathematical formula}K45n for reasoning about time, actions, desires, and intentions, among others, are being investigated.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The extension pursued in this work, of course, is with regards to obtaining a precise characterization for the beliefs of an agent. This was achieved by means of appealing to Levesque's notion of only knowing which, roughly speaking, augments classical epistemic logic with the modality O. However, there are a number of related notions, including, for example, minimal knowledge[2], [19], and total knowledge[20]. The notion of minimal knowledge from [2] is very similar in spirit to (propositional) {a mathematical formula}OL, especially when the two proposals are restricted to objective knowledge bases. But “all I know” is only a meta-language concept and not part of the vocabulary in the minimal knowledge proposal. Moreover, somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that reasoning about minimal knowledge is harder than reasoning about only knowing: see [21] for a complexity analysis (in the propositional setting wrt a single agent). Analogously, total knowledge is similar to {a mathematical formula}OL, except that knowledge is required to be true. Interestingly, for objective sentences, only knowing and total knowledge seem to coincide, but in general, the connection between {a mathematical formula}OL and AEL has no parallel with total knowledge. Some AEL defaults, it turns out, lead to an inconsistency [3]. We refer interested readers to [3], [12], [21] for more on {a mathematical formula}OL and related approaches. Among these, minimal knowledge has been extended to deal with multiple agents [2], [19], and only knowing, of course, has been extended to reason about multiple agents [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], discussed throughout this work.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Over the years, {a mathematical formula}OL has been extended in various ways, including a dynamic extension [7], probabilistic extensions [22], [23], among others [24]. More recently, only knowing has been shown to capture Reiter's default logic [25], [26], as well as other nonmonotonic formalisms [27], which has the same benefit that nonmonotonicity can be now inspected in terms of a simple (monotonic) semantics. We remark there are also other variants of only knowing, inspired by {a mathematical formula}OL, such as a model by Ben-David and Gafni [28], but these have problems that are discussed in [29].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Regarding AEL, besides the work already cited, a few other papers look at multiagent autoepistemic reasoning. In [30], [31], multiagent extensions of stable sets and stable expansions are proposed, together with special inference rules that allow for nonmonotonic inferences, which sometimes seem unwarranted on intuitive grounds. Moreover, the underlying language does not permit quantifying-in. Like Moore's original formulation, that proposal is also not motivated by a semantical account. In the context of speech acts, multiagent nonmonotonicity is investigated in [32], [33]. Typically, these correspond to situations where there are two agents: a speaker and a listener. Nonmonotonicity arises due to certain prototypical assumptions such as the assumption that a sentence with particular features relates to a particular property regarding the speaker. For instance, the utterance of a false fact by a speaker indicates that the speaker is not sincere. However, general purpose nonmonotonic reasoning is not considered in these proposals.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In terms of our proof-theoretic investigations of only knowing in the propositional case, we followed the approaches of [4], [12], [34] by considering Hilbert-style axiom systems. For us, the main purpose of a sound and complete axiom system is to provide another concise characterization of the valid sentences of the logic. If one is interested in actual proof systems, then other approaches such as tableaux or Gentzen-style systems (as in [13]) may be more appropriate. In the single-agent case, Bonatti and Olivetti [35] developed sequent calculi for nonmonotonic logics, which recently led to insights into the proof complexity [36] of nonmonotonic reasoning. It would be interesting to see whether and how these concepts can be generalized to multi-agent settings.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      As a final remark, we observe that the intuition of k-structures seems closely related to the proposal of knowledge structures[29]. Although restricted to a propositional language, and although only knowing is not considered, this proposal also constructs epistemic states at various depths. (See [37] for a similar semantical notion in game theory.) For an agent, a 1-world is simply a set of truth assignments to primitive propositions. This roughly corresponds to a set of worlds, similar to a 1-structure. However, a 2-world considers the triple: truth assignment to primitive propositions, a 1-world for A, and a 1-world for B. So this differs from our proposal slightly. They also expect k-worlds to satisfy various constraints, including one about knowledge always being correct. Despite these differences, they are also motivated by the ease of capturing non-beliefs, and so we believe a closer examination of the two proposals might be useful.

      Conclusion and outlook
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      In this work, we are concerned with only knowing, and how that extends to the multiagent case. Only knowing rationally reconstructs nonmonotonicity, AEL's flavor in particular, in a monotonic modal logic. Besides providing a clean model theory for a first-order language, the notion of only knowing is a very intuitive concept, allowing for a succinct and natural formulation for the beliefs and non-beliefs of an agent. An extension to the many agent case, then, seems pertinent.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In stark contrast to Levesque's simple logic, however, previous treatments of multiagent only knowing are surprisingly complex with undesirable features. They are also propositional. In this work, we looked at a first-order proposal. In order to do so, we had to deviate from the usual Kripke-based semantics, and appeal to a depth-of-KB based account. But as far as entailments are concerned, we showed that for finite KBs, such as in practical applications, sentences about what is believed and not believed at any depth can be reasoned with. We then argued that this proposal maintains our intuitions about {a mathematical formula}OL.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      For the propositional case, the logic can be characterized also in terms of a proof theory, which goes beyond the language restrictions of the axiomatization from [10]. In contrast to the work of [12], our proof theory does not bring concepts from the semantics to the axiomatization. Using the proof theory we gave example derivations exhibiting multiagent nonmonotonic reasoning. Interestingly, the axiomatization corresponds to the work of [12] but without having to resort to their complications.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Finally, as an extension to Levesque's insight that only knowing captures AEL, we considered a multiagent generalization of AEL and showed that a similar relationship holds with our framework.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In general, {a mathematical formula}OL can also be thought as a formal foundation for a knowledge representation service, where we query the KB on what the agent knows and does not know [3]. For this, a fundamental result called the representation theorem[38] shows how reasoning about knowledge can be reduced to first-order reasoning. We believe a similar move is possible with {a mathematical formula}OLn, and we would like to investigate this in the future. For preliminary results on a representation theorem for {a mathematical formula}OLn, see [39].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      A second major direction for future work is extending the semantics to handle unbounded modalities, as required, for example, with the notion of common knowledge. Perhaps an approach similar to the knowledge structures proposal [29] would prove fruitful. As discussed above, they too have epistemic states of various depths, and so a model of their language has epistemic states of every depth, including infinitary ones, allowing them to define a semantics for common knowledge. Following such an account, an analysis of the computational complexity for deciding the validity of formulas in the propositional case would also be insightful.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      On a different front, as pointed out in [40], when imagining knowledge-based agents in dynamical worlds, non-beliefs play an important role in informing the agent about what it is ignorant about. The agent then may be persuaded to deliberate on ways to complete its knowledge, say by sensing[41]. This intuition has encouraged extensions of {a mathematical formula}OL towards the design of practical cognitive agents [40], [42], [43], by introducing the appropriate variants of K and O in the language of the situation calculus [41], [44], [45]. Then, by stipulating all that is known initially, only knowing exhibits the desired behavior for how beliefs should change as a result of physical and sensing actions. Recently, this only knowing variant of the situation calculus has also been extended to capture defaults over actions [46], and reasoning about noisy effectors [22], [47]. In similar spirit, work on an amalgamation of actions and {a mathematical formula}OLn is under way [48]. Here too, only knowing offers a simple system to reason about the beliefs and the defaults of agents, especially in the context of how knowledge and ignorance changes as agents perceive and act in complex dynamical domains. From a practical standpoint, in dynamical systems, we would need to reason about knowledge and actions. Fortunately, there are well-known methodologies for resolving actions, either by reducing queries about the future to queries about the initial state or by updating the knowledge base [7], [41], [46], [49]. This would then mean that we would only need to reason about knowledge. Here is perhaps a second use of a representation theorem: it would provide the computational means for realizing such first-order reasoners. To see this in action, we refer interested readers to [39].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Epistemic logics play an important role in the investigations on multiagent interactions in knowledge representation applications, and we think the above line of work contributes to the area, especially in providing a formal specification for knowledge-based reasoners operating in an incompletely known world.
