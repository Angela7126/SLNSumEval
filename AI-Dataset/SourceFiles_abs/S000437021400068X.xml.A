      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Social network analysis (SNA) is a methodology used extensively in social and behavioral sciences, as well as in political science, economics, organization theory, and industrial engineering [58], [34], [64]. Positional analysis of a social network tries to find similarities between nodes in the network [6], [9], [25], [45], [65]. While many traditional clustering methods are based on the attributes of the individual nodes, SNA is more concerned with the structural similarity between the nodes. In SNA, a category, called a social role or social position, is defined in terms of the similarities of the patterns of relations between the nodes, rather than the attributes of the nodes. For example, one useful way to think about the social role “husband” is to consider it as a set of patterned interactions with a member or members of some other social categories, such as “wife” and “child” (and probably others) [34]. One of the most widely studied notions in the positional analysis of social networks is called regular equivalence[6], [20], [56], [57]. According to Borgatti and Everett [6], two actors are regularly equivalent if they are equally related to equivalent others.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Interestingly, Marx and Masush [51] showed that social positions based on regular equivalence can be syntactically expressed as well-formed formulas in a kind of modal logic. Thus, actors that have the same social position based on regular equivalence will satisfy the same set of modal formulas. Traditionally, modal logic has been considered the logic for reasoning about modalities, such as necessity, possibility, time, actions, beliefs, knowledge, and obligations. However, semantically, it is essentially a language for describing relational structures [3]. A relational structure is simply a collection of relations on a given universe; therefore, social networks can be represented by relational structures in mathematics. The logical characterization of social positions implies that modal formulas are semantically invariant with respect to regular equivalence.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In recent years, weighted social networks have also received considerable attention because they can represent both the qualitative relationships and the degrees of connection between nodes [2], [27], [28], [43], [54], [63]. The notion of regular equivalence is extended to weighted social networks based on two alternative definitions of regular equivalence [28]. While the two definitions are equivalent for ordinary networks, they induce different generalizations for weighted networks. The first generalization, called regular similarity, is based on the definition of regular equivalence as an equivalence relation that commutes with the underlying graph edges [9]. By the definition, regular similarity is a fuzzy relation that describes the degree of similarity between actors in the network. The second generalization, called generalized regular equivalence, is based on the definition of role assignment or coloring [45]. A role assignment (resp. coloring) is a mapping from the set of actors to a set of roles (resp. colors). The mapping is regular if actors assigned to the same role have the same roles in their neighborhoods. Consequently, generalized regular equivalence is an equivalence relation that can determine the role partition of actors in a weighted social network.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Because of the importance of weighted social networks, we explore the logical characterizations of regular similarity and generalized regular equivalence. In this paper, we use many-valued modal logics to characterize the two kinds of relations. On one hand, we show that the truth values of many-valued modal logic formulas are invariant with respect to generalized regular equivalence. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the maximum regular similarity between any two actors is equal to the minimum equivalence between degrees of the two actors satisfying many-valued modal logic formulas.
     </paragraph>

      The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review some basic concepts about social networks, fuzzy relations, and positional analysis. In Sections 3 and 4, we present the logical characterizations of regular similarity and generalized regular equivalence respectively. In Section 5, we discuss issues related to further generalizations and applications of the logical characterizations. Section 6 contains our concluding remarks.

       Social networks
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Social networks are defined by actors and relations (or nodes and edges in terms of graph theory) [34]. Generally, a social network is defined as a relational structure {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Ri)i∈I), where U is the set of nodes; I is an index set; and for each {a mathematical formula}i∈I, {a mathematical formula}Ri⊆Uki is a {a mathematical formula}ki-ary relation on the domain U, where {a mathematical formula}ki is a positive integer. If {a mathematical formula}ki=1, then {a mathematical formula}Ri is called an attribute or a property. In practice, most SNA methods only consider a simplified version of a social network with binary relations. For ease of presentation, we focus on a social network with unary and/or binary relations. Thus, the social network considered in this paper is a structure {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J), where the universe U is a finite set of actors; {a mathematical formula}Pi⊆U for all {a mathematical formula}i∈I; and {a mathematical formula}Rj⊆U×U for all {a mathematical formula}j∈J. Although practical social networks are always concerned with finite sets of attributes and relations, our results do not rely on the finitary assumptions about attributes and relations. Therefore, we only assume that the set of actors is finite and do not impose additional restrictions on the index sets I and J. In terms of graph theory, {a mathematical formula}N is a labeled graph, where U is a set of nodes labeled with subsets of I, and each {a mathematical formula}Rj denotes a set of (labeled) edges. For each {a mathematical formula}x∈U, the out-neighborhood and in-neighborhood of x with respect to a binary relation R, denoted respectively by Rx and {a mathematical formula}R−x, are defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} If E is an equivalence relation on U and x is an actor, the E-equivalence class of x is equal to its neighborhood, i.e., {a mathematical formula}[x]E=Ex=E−x. Note that the latter equality holds because of the symmetry of E. For any {a mathematical formula}X⊆U, we use {a mathematical formula}[X]E to denote the set {a mathematical formula}{[x]E|x∈X}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Several equivalence relations have been proposed for exploring the structural similarity between actors. Among them, regular equivalence has been studied extensively [6], [9], [25], [45], [65]. Although there are several definitions of regular equivalence, we only consider two of them in this paper. The first, proposed by Boyd and Everett [9], states that an equivalence relation E is a regular equivalence with respect to a binary relation R if it commutes with R; i.e.,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}E⋅R={(x,y)|∃z∈U,(x,z)∈E∧(z,y)∈R} is the composition of E and R. By this definition, if E is a regular equivalence with respect to R and {a mathematical formula}(x,y)∈E, then for each {a mathematical formula}z∈Rx(resp.R−x), there exists {a mathematical formula}z′∈Ry(resp.R−y) such that {a mathematical formula}(z,z′)∈E. The property leads naturally to the second definition of regular equivalence, which is based on role assignment [45]. It states that an equivalence relation E is a regular equivalence with respect to a binary relation R if for {a mathematical formula}x,y∈U,{a mathematical formula} According to this definition, if x and y are regularly equivalent, they are connected to equivalent neighborhoods.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 1">
       Obviously, the above definitions are equivalent. Thus, we have the following definition. Let {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J) be a social network and let E be an equivalence relation on U. Then, E is a regular equivalence with respect to {a mathematical formula}N if
      </paragraph>

       <list-item label="(1)">
        {a mathematical formula}(x,y)∈E implies that {a mathematical formula}x∈Pi iff {a mathematical formula}y∈Pi for all {a mathematical formula}i∈I; and

       <list-item label="(2)">
        E is a regular equivalence with respect to {a mathematical formula}Rj for all {a mathematical formula}j∈J.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       By this definition, there may exist more than one regular equivalence for a given network. However, it has been shown that there is always a maximum (i.e., coarsest) regular equivalence for a network [45]. Then, two actors, x and y, are deemed regularly equivalent in a network {a mathematical formula}N, denoted by {a mathematical formula}x≡Ny, if {a mathematical formula}(x,y) is in the coarsest regular equivalence of the network.

       Modal logic and regular equivalence
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Modal logics were originally developed as formalizations for reasoning about modalities. The initial formalization is the alethic modal logic (the logic of necessity and possibility). The modalities □ (for necessity) and ◇ (for possibility) have now become standard notations in modal logic literature. Several variants of modal logic have been proposed to deal with different classes of modalities; for example, temporal logic for tense operators, deontic logic for obligation and permission, dynamic logic for actions, and epistemic logic for beliefs and knowledge. The development of these logics was motivated by philosophical enquiry as well as by technical applications in computer science, artificial intelligence, and economic game theory.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       While modal logics were initially presented in the form of reasoning systems, the relational semantics have influenced the continuing development of the field [41], [42]. The semantics, proposed independently by J. Hintikka, S. Kanger, and S. Kripke, and now known as Kripke semantics, show that modal logics are in fact logics for reasoning about relational structures. From this semantic perspective, standard modal logics can be regarded as fragments of first- or second-order predicate logics, where the necessity and possibility modalities correspond to universal and existential quantifiers respectively. Despite this correspondence, quantification in modal logic tends to be bounded in some way to worlds that are “relevant to” or “accessible from” the current one. Consequently, although a number of properties of modal logics follow immediately from those of their classical quantificational counterparts, the modal operators typically have less expressive power than full quantification. This yields many interesting properties not available in classical predicate logic. One of the most striking results is that semantic invariances between models are actually various forms of bisimulation, which preserve the local properties of worlds and their transition patterns [3]. Interestingly, it has been shown that bisimulation in Kripke models corresponds exactly to regular equivalence in social networks [51]. The implication of the results is that position-equivalent actors can be characterized by an appropriate set of modal formulas.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       As with any other formal logic, the presentation of a modal logic requires the specification of its syntax and semantics. The syntactic aspect includes the language of the logic—its alphabet and formation rules for formulas, as well as a deductive system for logical reasoning. For the purposes of this paper, we only need consider the language part. With regard to the semantic aspect, we have to define the models within which the formulas can be interpreted, as well as the satisfaction of a formula in a model.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We start with propositional modal logic (PML) [14]. The alphabet of PML comprises a set of propositional symbols PV, the logical constant ⊥, the logical connectives ∧ and →, and the modal operator ◇. The set of formulas of PML is the smallest set containing {a mathematical formula}PV∪{⊥} that satisfies the following conditions:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="•">
        if φ and ψ are formulas, then {a mathematical formula}φ∧ψ and {a mathematical formula}φ→ψ are formulas,
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="•">
        if φ is a formula, then ◇φ is a formula.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       As usual, we abbreviate {a mathematical formula}φ→⊥ as ¬φ; {a mathematical formula}¬(¬φ∧¬ψ) as {a mathematical formula}φ∨ψ; {a mathematical formula}(φ→ψ)∧(ψ→φ) as {a mathematical formula}φ↔ψ; {a mathematical formula}¬◇¬φ as □φ; and ¬⊥ as ⊤. A Kripke model for PML is a triple {a mathematical formula}M=(W,R,V), where W is a set of possible worlds, R is a binary relation on W, called an accessibility relation, and {a mathematical formula}V:W×PV→{0,1} is a truth assignment for evaluating the truth value of each propositional symbol in each world. The satisfaction of a formula φ in a world w of the model {a mathematical formula}M, denoted by {a mathematical formula}M,w⊨φ, is defined by the following clauses:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="(1)">
        {a mathematical formula}M,w⊨p if {a mathematical formula}V(w,p)=1 for each {a mathematical formula}p∈PV;
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(2)">
        {a mathematical formula}M,w⊭⊥;
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(3)">
        {a mathematical formula}M,w⊨φ∧ψ iff {a mathematical formula}M,w⊨φ and {a mathematical formula}M,w⊨ψ;
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(4)">
        {a mathematical formula}M,w⊨φ→ψ iff {a mathematical formula}M,w⊭φ or {a mathematical formula}M,w⊨ψ;
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(5)">
        {a mathematical formula}M,w⊨◇φ iff there exists {a mathematical formula}(w,u)∈R such that {a mathematical formula}M,u⊨φ.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       Bisimulation, an important notion in the model theory of modal logics, is very useful for studying the expressibility of modal languages. We present the following definition of bisimulation for PML [3].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 2">
       Let {a mathematical formula}M=(W,R,V) and {a mathematical formula}M′=(W′,R′,V′) be two Kripke models. A non-empty binary relation {a mathematical formula}Z⊆W×W′ is a bisimulation between {a mathematical formula}M and {a mathematical formula}M′, denoted by {a mathematical formula}Z:M↔̲M′ if the following conditions are satisfied:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="(1)">
        If {a mathematical formula}(w,w′)∈Z, then {a mathematical formula}V(w,p)=V(w′,p) for any {a mathematical formula}p∈PV (base).
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(2)">
        If {a mathematical formula}(w,w′)∈Z and {a mathematical formula}(w,u)∈R, then there exists {a mathematical formula}u′∈W′ such that {a mathematical formula}(u,u′)∈Z and {a mathematical formula}(w′,u′)∈R′ (forth).
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(3)">
        If {a mathematical formula}(w,w′)∈Z and {a mathematical formula}(w′,u′)∈R′, then there exists {a mathematical formula}u∈W such that {a mathematical formula}(u,u′)∈Z and {a mathematical formula}(w,u)∈R (back).
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       When Z is a bisimulation that links two worlds w in {a mathematical formula}M and {a mathematical formula}w′ in {a mathematical formula}M′ (i.e., {a mathematical formula}(w,w′)∈Z), we say that w and {a mathematical formula}w′ are bisimular. In the context of this paper, we are especially interested in the bisimulation between a model and itself. Thus, when we discuss bisimular worlds in this paper, we always mean possible worlds in the same model.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Propositional multi-modal logic (PMML) is an extension of PML that allows more than one modality [36]. It is particularly suitable for reasoning about relational structures that contain a number of binary relations, e.g., social networks. The alphabet of PMML comprises a set of propositional symbols PV, a set of relational symbols REL, the logical constant, the logical connectives, the relational converse symbol {a mathematical formula}−, and the modality-forming symbol 〈〉. The set of formulas of PMML is the smallest set containing {a mathematical formula}PV∪{⊥} that satisfies the following conditions:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="•">
        if φ and ψ are formulas, then {a mathematical formula}φ∧ψ and {a mathematical formula}φ→ψ are formulas,
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="•">
        if φ is a formula and α is a relational symbol, then {a mathematical formula}〈α〉φ and {a mathematical formula}〈α−〉φ are formulas.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       We abbreviate {a mathematical formula}¬〈α〉¬φ and {a mathematical formula}¬〈α−〉¬φ as {a mathematical formula}[α]φ and {a mathematical formula}[α−]φ respectively. A Kripke model for PMML is a triple {a mathematical formula}M=(W,(Rα)α∈REL,V), where W and V are the same as above, and for each {a mathematical formula}α∈REL, {a mathematical formula}Rα is a binary relation on W. The satisfaction of PMML formulas is defined in the same way as that of PML formulas, except that clause (5) is replaced by
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="(5)">
        {a mathematical formula}M,w⊨〈α〉φ iff there exists {a mathematical formula}(w,u)∈Rα such that {a mathematical formula}M,u⊨φ;
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(6)">
        {a mathematical formula}M,w⊨〈α−〉φ iff there exists {a mathematical formula}(u,w)∈Rα such that {a mathematical formula}M,u⊨φ,
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       for any {a mathematical formula}α∈REL. Note that we need the converse modalities {a mathematical formula}〈α−〉 because all positional equivalences are defined with respect to their in-neighborhoods and out-neighborhoods. The modality {a mathematical formula}〈α〉 allows us to access the out-neighborhood of a world, while {a mathematical formula}〈α−〉 is needed to access the in-neighborhood. It is straightforward to extend the notion of bisimulation to PMML models.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The first logical characterization of positional equivalences is presented for regular equivalences with a particular type of PMML [51]. It is demonstrated by the connection between regular equivalence and bisimulation. Given a social network {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J), we define a PMML language with the following basic symbols:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="(1)">
        {a mathematical formula}PV={pi|i∈I};
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(2)">
        {a mathematical formula}REL={αj|j∈J}.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       The social network {a mathematical formula}N is transformed into a Kripke model {a mathematical formula}MN=(U,(Rj)j∈J,V), where V is defined by {a mathematical formula}V(x,pi)=1 iff {a mathematical formula}x∈Pi for all {a mathematical formula}x∈U and {a mathematical formula}i∈I, and {a mathematical formula}Rj denotes {a mathematical formula}Rαj for {a mathematical formula}j∈J. Let {a mathematical formula}LN be the set of formulas of the PMML. Then, we say that two actors, x and y, are modally equivalent with respect to {a mathematical formula}N if for all {a mathematical formula}φ∈LN, {a mathematical formula}MN,x⊨φ iff {a mathematical formula}MN,y⊨φ.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 1">
       (See[51].) Let{a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J)be a social network. Then, for all{a mathematical formula}x,y∈U,{a mathematical formula}x≡Nyiff x and y are modally equivalent with respect to{a mathematical formula}N.

       Marx and Masuch [51] showed that regular equivalences on {a mathematical formula}N are bisimulations between {a mathematical formula}MN and itself, i.e., {a mathematical formula}x≡Ny iff x and y are bisimular. By the Hennessy–Milner Theorem (see Theorem 2.24 in [3]), x and y are bisimular iff they are modally equivalent with respect to {a mathematical formula}N.  □

       Weighted social networks
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Social networks can model the interactions and connections between actors. However, in most real-world networks, the ties in a network do not have the same capacity. In fact, ties are often associated with weights that differentiate them in terms of their strength, intensity, or capacity [2], [10], [18], [19], [27], [28], [43], [44], [52], [54], [59], [63]. Mathematically, we can use fuzzy sets and relations to model weighted social networks. The elements of fuzzy sets have different degrees of membership [66], which are typically drawn from the unit interval {a mathematical formula}[0,1]. Formally, a fuzzy set P on the domain U is a membership function {a mathematical formula}P:U→[0,1]. Alternatively, a fuzzy set can be represented as a class of crisp sets {a mathematical formula}{Pc|c∈[0,1]}, where {a mathematical formula}Pc={u∈U|P(u)≥c} is called the c-cut of P. A t-norm operation on {a mathematical formula}[0,1] is normally used to define the intersection of fuzzy sets. A t-norm is a binary operation ⊗ on {a mathematical formula}[0,1] that satisfies commutativity and associativity, and is non-decreasing in both arguments; and {a mathematical formula}1⊗c=c and {a mathematical formula}0⊗c=0 for all {a mathematical formula}c∈[0,1][31]. The residuum of a t-norm ⊗ is a binary operation ⇒ on {a mathematical formula}[0,1] defined as {a mathematical formula}a⇒b=sup{c|a⊗c≤b} for all {a mathematical formula}a,b∈[0,1]. Note that the residuum operation satisfies the following property:{a mathematical formula} Furthermore, the residuum defines its corresponding unary operation of the precomplement{sup:1}{a mathematical formula}−c=c⇒0. In this paper, we mainly use the well-known Gödel t-norm {a mathematical formula}a⊗b=min(a,b). Hence, its corresponding residuum is defined by{a mathematical formula} and its corresponding precomplement is the Gödel negation defined by{a mathematical formula} In addition, we use {a mathematical formula}a⇔b to denote {a mathematical formula}min(a⇒b,b⇒a). It is easy to see that{a mathematical formula}

       In fuzzy set theory, a fuzzy binary relation R on U is a fuzzy set on the domain {a mathematical formula}U×U. Thus, a fuzzy binary relation R can be represented as the membership function {a mathematical formula}R:U×U→[0,1]. Obviously, a fuzzy binary relation is a generalization of a binary relation, so the upper-case letters {a mathematical formula}R,S,T, etc., are used to denote both fuzzy and crisp relations. Because we only consider fuzzy binary relations in this paper, we call them fuzzy relations hereafter; and the term “binary relation” means crisp relations only. A fuzzy relation R is included in another fuzzy relation S, denoted by {a mathematical formula}R⊆S, if {a mathematical formula}R(x,y)≤S(x,y) for all {a mathematical formula}x,y∈U. Several basic operations for binary relations can be easily generalized to fuzzy relations. Given two fuzzy relations R and S on U, the following fuzzy relations can be derived:

      <paragraph label="Definition 4">
       The composition of R with itself k times is denoted by {a mathematical formula}Rk and the transitive closure of R is defined as {a mathematical formula}R∞=⋃k≥1Rk. Based on these definitions, an equivalence relation can be generalized to a similarity relation in fuzzy set theory.A fuzzy relation S is called a similarity relation if it satisfies the following properties:

       Intuitively, if S is a similarity relation, then {a mathematical formula}S(x,y) specifies the degree of similarity between x and y. As with equivalence relations, the set of all similarity relations on a domain U form a lattice. The meet and join of two similarity relations {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 in the lattice are defined as {a mathematical formula}S1⊓S2=S1∩S2 and {a mathematical formula}S1⊔S2=(S1∪S2)∞ respectively.

       Given the basic notations of fuzzy sets and relations, a weighted social network can be defined as a structure {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J), where U is a finite set of actors; {a mathematical formula}Pi is a fuzzy subset of U for all {a mathematical formula}i∈I; and {a mathematical formula}Rj is a fuzzy relation on U for all {a mathematical formula}j∈J. Although the membership degrees of fuzzy sets and relations may be any real numbers from the unit interval, in practice, the weights in a weighted social network are rarely irrational numbers. Thus, we further assume that the membership degrees of {a mathematical formula}Pi's and {a mathematical formula}Rj's are all rational.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 5">
       We have defined regular equivalence in two ways. Although the definitions coincide for classical social networks, they behave quite differently in weighted social networks. Based on the commutativity between the similarity relation and the underlying fuzzy relations, we can induce a kind of structural similarity between actors. Such a similarity is called a regular similarity. Formally, a similarity relation S is called a regular similarity with respect to a fuzzy relation R if it commutes with R, i.e., {a mathematical formula}S⋅R=R⋅S. Hence, the regular similarity of a weighted social network can be defined as follows. Let {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J) be a weighted social network, and let S be a similarity relation on U. Then, S is a regular similarity with respect to {a mathematical formula}N if

       In [28], Fan et al. show that regular similarities are closed with respect to the usual join of similarity relations. Thus, we can define the maximum (with respect to fuzzy inclusion) regular similarity of a weighted social network.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 6">
       On the other hand, based on the notion of role assignment, we can derive the concept of generalized regular equivalence (GRE). Although regular similarity is a fuzzy relation, GRE yields a crisp partition of the actors in a weighted network. To define GRE, we need to consider the neighborhoods of the nodes in weighted networks. Let R be a fuzzy relation on U. Then, for each {a mathematical formula}x∈U, the out-neighborhood and in-neighborhood of x, still denoted by Rx and {a mathematical formula}R−x respectively, are two fuzzy subsets of U with the following membership functions:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} for any {a mathematical formula}y∈U. Let F be a fuzzy subset of U and E be an equivalence relation on U. Then, {a mathematical formula}[F]E is a fuzzy subset of the quotient set {a mathematical formula}U/E={[x]E|x∈U} with the following membership function:{a mathematical formula} for any {a mathematical formula}X∈U/E. Based on the notations, a GRE with respect to a fuzzy relation R is defined as an equivalence relation E such that{a mathematical formula} for any {a mathematical formula}(x,y)∈E. Hence, the GRE of a weighted social network can be defined as follows. Let {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J) be a weighted social network, and let E be an equivalence relation on U. Then, E is a GRE with respect to {a mathematical formula}N if

       Like regular equivalences, GRE is also closed with respect to the usual join of equivalence relations. Thus, we can define the maximum (i.e., the coarsest) GRE of a weighted social network. In addition, we use {a mathematical formula}x≡Ngy to denote that {a mathematical formula}(x,y) is in the maximum GRE of the network.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The main difference between regular similarity and GRE is that the former is a fuzzy relation, whereas the latter is a crisp relation. Thus, they can be applied in different situations. For example, an on-line social network user may wish to query the data center about actors that are similar to himself for the purposes of advertising, seeking friends, or simply sharing information. By using GRE to partition the network into equivalence classes, the user can find all actors that are in his equivalence class. On the other hand, the regular similarity can provide a ranking of actors that satisfy the user's requirement in terms of the degree of similarity to himself.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Lemma 1">
       Despite the difference between regular similarity and GRE, GRE is actually a special kind of regular similarity (i.e., the kind of crisp regular similarity), as shown by the following lemma.

       Note that each c-cut ({a mathematical formula}c∈[0,1]) of a similarity relation is an equivalence relation.

      Regular similarity and modal logic
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      As with ordinary social networks, we want to find a logical language that can characterize regular similarity in weighted social networks. Many-valued modal logic is a candidate language because its formulas typically have a degree of truth in a lattice. It is an extension of modal logic based on many-valued logics. There are various many-valued logics that differ in terms of the choice of syntax and semantics. Hajek [31] introduced a family of {a mathematical formula}[0,1]-valued logics in which the most important instances are Łukasiewicz, Gödel and product logics. These logic systems are interpreted in algebraic structures called residuated lattices such that continuous t-norms and their corresponding residua in the algebras are taken as the truth functions of the conjunction and the implication respectively. In this paper, we focus on Gödel modal logic {a mathematical formula}G(□◇), which we introduce below.

      The alphabet of {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) is similar to that of PMML, but some subtle differences. First, the necessity and possibility modalities of PMML are inter-definable in a dual way, but such duality does not exist in {a mathematical formula}G(□◇). Second, to represent a partial truth, {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) is extended with the set of truth constants {a mathematical formula}c¯ for each rational {a mathematical formula}c∈[0,1]. Thus, the alphabet of {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) comprises a set of propositional symbols PV; the set of truth constant {a mathematical formula}{c¯|c a rational number in {a mathematical formula}[0,1]}; a set of relational symbols REL; the logical connectives ∧ and →; the relational converse symbol {a mathematical formula}−; and the modality-forming symbols {a mathematical formula}[] and 〈〉. The set of formulas of {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) is the smallest set that contains PV and the set of truth constants that satisfies the following conditions:

      Let S be a fuzzy relation such that its membership function is defined as{a mathematical formula}Then, S is a regular similarity of{a mathematical formula}N.We have to prove that S is a similarity relation that satisfies the two conditions of Definition 5. It is straightforward to verify that S is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Moreover, the first condition holds trivially because PV is a subset of {a mathematical formula}G(◇)N. Hence, we only need to show that {a mathematical formula}S⋅Rj=Rj⋅S for any {a mathematical formula}j∈J. It suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}S⋅Rj≤Rj⋅S and {a mathematical formula}S⋅Rj−≤Rj−⋅S because the latter implies that {a mathematical formula}Rj⋅S≤S⋅Rj by the relation's converse and the symmetry of S. First, we show {a mathematical formula}S⋅Rj≤Rj⋅S for any {a mathematical formula}j∈J. Assume this is not the case. Then, there exist {a mathematical formula}j∈J and {a mathematical formula}x,y∈U such that {a mathematical formula}S⋅Rj(x,y)&gt;Rj⋅S(x,y).

      Theorem 2 then follows immediately from the above two lemmas and the fact that {a mathematical formula}G(◇)N is a subset of {a mathematical formula}G(□◇)N.

      It is well-known that the □-fragment and the ◇-fragment usually exhibit a kind of asymmetry in deductive systems of many-valued modal logics [8], [11], [12], [13].

However, as we do not have a counterexample of the lemma for {a mathematical formula}G(□), it is still unclear if the □-fragments of the above-mentioned logics can also characterize regular similarity.

      To present the logical characterization of GRE, we have to extend {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) with the projection operator Δ. As the operator was first used by Baaz for Gödel logic, it is also called the Baaz Delta [1]. The projection operator {a mathematical formula}Δ:[0,1]→{0,1} is defined by{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula}GΔ(□◇) be the extension of {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) with the unary projection connective Δ.

      The projection connective can be also defined by an involutive negation. A negation operator is involutive if it satisfies the double negation law. It is easy to see that the negation in {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) is not involutive. That is, {a mathematical formula}¬¬φ↔φ is not a 1-tautology in {a mathematical formula}G(□◇). The extensions of many-valued logic with an additional involutive negation have been studied extensively in [15], [24]. Let {a mathematical formula}G∼(□◇) be the extension of {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) with the involutive negation ∼.

Thus, {a mathematical formula}G∼(□◇) is more expressive than {a mathematical formula}GΔ(□◇). As above, the □-fragment and ◇-fragment of these two logics are denoted by {a mathematical formula}GΔ(□), {a mathematical formula}G∼(□), {a mathematical formula}GΔ(◇), and {a mathematical formula}G∼(◇).

        First, we prove that {a mathematical formula}≡Ng implies {a mathematical formula}G∼(□◇)-equivalence by induction on the complexity of the formulas. The induction base follows trivially from the first condition of Definition 6 and the fact that any truth constant has the same truth value in all possible worlds. The induction steps for the connectives {a mathematical formula}∧,→, and ∼ are also straightforward because they are all truth functional. Thus, we only need to prove the result for the modal formulas.

        It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}G∼(□◇)-equivalence implies {a mathematical formula}GΔ(□◇)-equivalence and {a mathematical formula}G∼(◇)-equivalence, both of which imply {a mathematical formula}GΔ(◇)-equivalence due to the expressive powers of the respective languages and their fragments.

        To prove that {a mathematical formula}GΔ(◇)-equivalence implies {a mathematical formula}≡Ng, we let E denote the {a mathematical formula}GΔ(◇)-equivalence relation on U and show that E is a GRE. Then, as {a mathematical formula}≡Ng is the maximum GRE, E must be its subset. Trivially, E is an equivalence relation that satisfies the first condition of Definition 6 because PV is a subset of {a mathematical formula}GΔ(◇)N. Assume E does not satisfy the second condition of Definition 6. That is, there exist {a mathematical formula}j∈J and {a mathematical formula}x,y∈U such that {a mathematical formula}(x,y)∈E, but{a mathematical formula} Let us first consider the case where {a mathematical formula}[Rjx]E≠[Rjy]E. Without loss of generality, we can assume that an enumeration of the quotient set {a mathematical formula}U/E={X1,X2,⋯,Xn} and {a mathematical formula}[Rjx]E(X1)≠[Rjy]E(X1). By slightly abusing the notation, given {a mathematical formula}1≤k≤n and any formula φ, we can use {a mathematical formula}V(Xk,φ) to denote {a mathematical formula}V(u,φ) for any {a mathematical formula}u∈Xk because {a mathematical formula}Xk is an equivalence class of E. Now, as E is the {a mathematical formula}GΔ(◇)-equivalence relation, there exists {a mathematical formula}ψk such that {a mathematical formula}V(X1,ψk)≠V(Xk,ψk) for every {a mathematical formula}2≤k≤n. We let {a mathematical formula}ck denote {a mathematical formula}V(X1,ψk) and define {a mathematical formula}φk=Δ(ψk↔ck¯) for {a mathematical formula}2≤k≤n and {a mathematical formula}φ=⋀2≤k≤nφk. Then, we have {a mathematical formula}V(X1,φ)=1 and {a mathematical formula}V(Xk,φ)=0 for {a mathematical formula}2≤k≤n. Hence,{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Consequently, the formula {a mathematical formula}〈αj〉φ has different truth values in x and y, which violates the assumption that {a mathematical formula}(x,y)∈E and leads to a contradiction. Hence, it is impossible that {a mathematical formula}[Rjx]E≠[Rjy]E. The impossibility of {a mathematical formula}[Rj−x]E≠[Rj−y]E can be proved similarly. Therefore, E must satisfy the second condition of Definition 6, so it is a GRE.

        To prove that {a mathematical formula}ΔL-equivalence and {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence are the same, we only need to prove that the former implies the latter. Assume that {a mathematical formula}V(x,Δφ)=V(y,Δφ) for any {a mathematical formula}φ∈LN that does not start with Δ, and assume that x and y are not {a mathematical formula}L-equivalent. Then, there exists {a mathematical formula}ψ∈LN such that {a mathematical formula}V(x,ψ)≠V(y,ψ). Without loss of generality, let {a mathematical formula}a=V(x,ψ)&lt;V(y,ψ)=b and let {a mathematical formula}φ=ψ↔a¯. Then, {a mathematical formula}φ∈LN and does not start with Δ. However, {a mathematical formula}1=V(x,Δφ)≠V(y,Δφ)=0, which contradicts the assumption that x and y are {a mathematical formula}ΔL-equivalent.

      The third item of the theorem shows that the connective Δ is crucial for the logical characterization of GRE. The result cannot be further strengthened to {a mathematical formula}ΔG(□,◇)-equivalence (or {a mathematical formula}ΔG(◇)-equivalence) because it coincides with {a mathematical formula}G(□,◇)-equivalence as shown in the proof of the theorem. However, by Corollary 1, {a mathematical formula}G(□,◇)-equivalence is equal to the 1-cut of the maximum regular similarity, which is not necessarily a GRE, as shown in Example 1.

       Special case: hybrid social networks
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In weighted social networks, each actor is associated with fuzzy attributes and connected with other actors by fuzzy relations. However, there is a special kind of weighted social network in which the attributes are crisp although the relations between the actors are still weighted. For example, in a friendship network, the strength of ties determines the degree of friendship between the actors. Hence, the friendship relation is modeled as a fuzzy relation. However, all personal attributes of each actor, such as gender, age, and occupation, may be crisp. To model such networks, we say that a weighted social network {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J) is a hybrid social network if for each {a mathematical formula}i∈I, {a mathematical formula}Pi is a crisp subset of U.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In addition to the characterizations above, we can use quantitative modal logic (QML) [46], [47], [48], [49] to derive an alternative characterization of GRE in hybrid social networks. QML is a modal version of possibilistic logic, which is a logic for reasoning about uncertainty based on possibility theory [21], [22]. In the theory, a possibility distribution on the universe U is a function {a mathematical formula}π:U→[0,1]; and two measures on U, called possibility and necessity measures and denoted by Π and N respectively, can be derived from π. Formally, {a mathematical formula}Π,N:2U→[0,1] are defined as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}X¯ is the complement of X with respect to U. In a weighted social network, each actor's out-neighborhood and in-neighborhood with respect to a fuzzy relation can be seen as possibility distributions. In other words, the membership functions in Eqs. (14) and (15) correspond to such possibility distributions. The modalities in QML can represent the lower bounds of the possibility and necessity measures of propositions, each of which is interpreted as a subset of possible worlds (or actors).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The alphabet of QML is the same as that of PMML, but the formation rule for modal formulas is modified as follows:

        if φ is a formula, α is a relational symbol, and c is a rational number in {a mathematical formula}[0,1], then {a mathematical formula}〈α≥c〉φ, {a mathematical formula}〈α&gt;c〉φ, {a mathematical formula}〈α≥c−〉φ, and {a mathematical formula}〈α&gt;c−〉φ are all formulas.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       Because QML is a two-valued logic, the necessity modalities can be defined from the corresponding possibility modalities. For example, {a mathematical formula}[α≥c]φ is an abbreviation of {a mathematical formula}¬〈α&gt;1−c〉¬φ.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>

      <paragraph>
       The main feature of QML is that the numerical possibility measures are internalized by using modal operators. Thus, unlike many-valued modal logic, its interpretation is two-valued. However, QML can be faithfully interpreted by a subclass of Kripke models for {a mathematical formula}GΔ(□◇) (and {a mathematical formula}G∼(□◇)), namely, the models in which {a mathematical formula}V(p)∈{0,1} for any {a mathematical formula}p∈PV.

       Cut-based definition of regular similarity
      </section-title>
      <paragraph label="Definition 7">
       Example 1 shows that the 1-cut of the maximum regular similarity is not necessarily a GRE. Hence, although a regular similarity can be decomposed into a family of equivalence relations (i.e., its c-cuts), we need logics with different expressive powers to characterize regular similarity and GRE respectively. However, by using the notion of weak bisimulation in [23], we can provide an alternative definition of regular similarity in terms of its c-cuts. Weak bisimulation is defined as a family of binary relations between two Heyting-valued possible world models. In the context of weighted social networks, the definition can be simplified as follows. Let {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J) be a weighted social network. Then, a weak bisimulation on {a mathematical formula}N is a function {a mathematical formula}Z:(0,1]→2U×U such that

       For any {a mathematical formula}c∈(0,1], two actors {a mathematical formula}x,y∈U are called weakly c-bisimular in {a mathematical formula}N (notation {a mathematical formula}x≡Ncy) if there exists a weak bisimulation Z on {a mathematical formula}N such that {a mathematical formula}(x,y)∈Z(c). The truth invariance of Heyting-valued modal logic with respect to weak bisimulation is stated as follows [23, Theorems 3.11 and 3.14]. Let{a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J)be a weighted social network and let{a mathematical formula}MN=(U,(Rj)j∈J,V)be its corresponding Kripke model. Then, for any{a mathematical formula}x,y∈Uand{a mathematical formula}c∈(0,1],{a mathematical formula}x≡Ncyiff for any formula{a mathematical formula}φ∈G(□◇)N,{a mathematical formula}min(c,V(x,φ))=min(c,V(y,φ)).

       Although it is possible to prove the equivalence between regular similarity and weak bisimulation by using the definitions directly, the equivalence can also be derived from Theorem 2, Theorem 5 as a corollary.

       Regular similarity in general structures
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Following [27], [28], we use sup-min composition and transitivity (Definition 3, Definition 4) to define regular similarity. However, it has been suggested that (1) the definitions can be generalized by using any t-norm to replace the min operation; and (2) the maximum regular similarity can be found by solving certain systems of fuzzy relation equations and inequalities [16], [17], [39], [40]. Although the generalization extends the application scope of weighted social networks, the logical characterization theorem does not hold for any t-norm and its corresponding residuum. For instance, let us consider another two well-studied t-norms in fuzzy logic, i.e., the Łukasiewicz t-norm and the product t-norm [31]. These two t-norms and their residua are defined as follows:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="(1)">
        Łukasiewicz t-norm: {a mathematical formula}a⊗Łb=max(a+b−1,0) and its residuum: {a mathematical formula}a⇒Łb=min(1−a+b,1);
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(2)">
        product t-norm: {a mathematical formula}a⊗Pb=a⋅b and its residuum: {a mathematical formula}a⇒Pb=min(ba,1).
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       For simplicity, we omit the subscripts Ł and P and simply write ⊗ and ⇒ when the meanings of the notations are clear from the context. With regard to the Łukasiewicz t-norm, we can define {a mathematical formula}a⇔b=(a⇒b)⊗(b⇒a)=min(a⇒b,b⇒a)=1−|a−b|, and for the product t-norm {a mathematical formula}a⇔b=(a⇒b)⊗(b⇒a)=min(a⇒b,b⇒a)=min(ba,ab).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       As with Gödel logic, we can define the Łukasiewicz and product modal logics {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇) and {a mathematical formula}P(□◇) as follows. The alphabet of {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇) and {a mathematical formula}P(□◇) is an extension of that of {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) with an additional conjunction symbol &amp;. In {a mathematical formula}G(□◇), &amp; is reduced to the ordinary conjunction ∧. Thus, we do not need &amp; in the {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) language. However, in {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇) and {a mathematical formula}P(□◇), the t-norms are not the min operation, so &amp; and ∧ are interpreted differently. The Kripke model for {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇) and {a mathematical formula}P(□◇) is still the same as that for {a mathematical formula}G(□◇), but the truth assignment must be modified accordingly. For a model {a mathematical formula}M=(W,(Rα)α∈REL,V), we add the following condition to the truth function of {a mathematical formula}G(□◇):{a mathematical formula} and the evaluation of modal formulas is modified as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where ⇒ is interpreted as the corresponding residuum of the t-norm. Furthermore, the evaluation of the implication is {a mathematical formula}V(w,φ→ψ)=V(w,φ)⇒V(w,ψ). We use the following example to show that Theorem 2 fails for both {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇) and {a mathematical formula}P(□◇).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 2">
       Let us consider a degenerated weighted social network {a mathematical formula}N=(U,P1,P2) and assume that there exist at least two distinct actors {a mathematical formula}x,y∈U such that {a mathematical formula}P1(x)=1, {a mathematical formula}P1(y)=0.9, {a mathematical formula}P2(x)=0.9, {a mathematical formula}P2(y)=0.8. Then, for {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇), the membership function of the maximum regular similarity S satisfies {a mathematical formula}S(x,y)=min(1−|P1(x)−P1(y)|,1−|P2(x)−P2(y)|)=0.9. However, by the semantics, {a mathematical formula}V(x,p1&amp;p2)=1+0.9−1=0.9 and {a mathematical formula}V(y,p1&amp;p2)=0.9+0.8−1=0.7. Thus, {a mathematical formula}(V(x,p1&amp;p2)⇔V(y,p1&amp;p2))=1−|0.9−0.7|=0.8, which is less than {a mathematical formula}S(x,y), and Theorem 2 fails for {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇). Analogously, for {a mathematical formula}P(□◇), the membership function of S satisfies {a mathematical formula}S(x,y)=min(P1(y)P1(x),P2(y)P2(x))=89. However, {a mathematical formula}V(x,p1&amp;p2)=1⋅0.9=0.9 and {a mathematical formula}V(y,p1&amp;p2)=0.9⋅0.8=0.72, so {a mathematical formula}(V(x,p1&amp;p2)⇔V(y,p1&amp;p2))=0.720.9=0.8, which is less than {a mathematical formula}S(x,y). Consequently, Theorem 2 also fails for {a mathematical formula}P(□◇). It may be argued that the correct formulation of Theorem 2 should replace the inf operation on the right-hand side with the corresponding t-norm for {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇) and {a mathematical formula}P(□◇), since the symbol ⇔ has been interpreted by using the respective residua. However, because {a mathematical formula}a⊗b≤min(a,b) holds for any t-norm and {a mathematical formula}a,b∈[0,1], the reformulated theorem still fails in our example. Note that, for the degenerated weighted social network, the logics {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇) and {a mathematical formula}P(□◇) are reduced to propositional Łukasiewicz logic and propositional product logic respectively, because the set of modalities is empty. Thus, the degenerated weighted social network is simply a set of fuzzy interpretations for these two propositional logics. In general, the definition of the regular similarity of S with respect to a fuzzy relation R should be modified appropriately for Łukasiewicz and product structures. That is, the min operation in (11) should be replaced by Łukasiewicz or product t-norms. However, because the second condition of regular similarity is vacuously true for the degenerated case, Theorem 2 fails no matter how the relational composition is defined. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Theorem 2 holds for the non-degenerated case, because adding modal formulas to the right-hand sides of (18) and (19) simply make them smaller no matter which t-norm is used.  □

       GRE in general structures
      </section-title>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 6">
       We have shown several negative results for the generalizations of Theorem 2, but the situation is more encouraging in the case of GRE. As above, we can extend {a mathematical formula}P(□◇) to {a mathematical formula}PΔ(□◇) and {a mathematical formula}P∼(□◇) with the Baaz Delta operator or the involutive negation. However, in {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇), the negation defined by {a mathematical formula}¬φ=φ→0¯ is semantically equivalent to the involutive negation ∼, so the Gödel negation is missing in {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇). Thus, we only need to extend {a mathematical formula}Ł(□◇) to {a mathematical formula}ŁΔ(□◇) with the Baaz Delta operator. Then, the Gödel negation can be defined as {a mathematical formula}Δ¬φ in {a mathematical formula}ŁΔ(□◇). Let us define {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence and {a mathematical formula}ΔL-equivalence on the universe of actors in the same way as above for any {a mathematical formula}L=P∼(□◇),PΔ(□◇), {a mathematical formula}ŁΔ(□◇),P∼(◇),PΔ(◇), {a mathematical formula}ŁΔ(◇). Then, we can show that Theorem 3 also holds for these extended logical systems. Formally, we have Let{a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J)be a weighted social network and let L be one of the logics{a mathematical formula}P∼(□◇),PΔ(□◇),{a mathematical formula}ŁΔ(□◇),P∼(◇),PΔ(◇),{a mathematical formula}ŁΔ(◇). Then, for any{a mathematical formula}x,y∈U, the following statements are equivalent:

       By checking the proof of Theorem 3, it is easy to see that replacing the Gödel t-norm with the Łukasiewicz t-norm or product t-norm, the proof is still valid. The key facts are as follows:

       It may be thought that the max in Eq. (16) and the sup in the evaluation of modal formulas should be replaced by a t-conorm if we use other t-norms instead of the min operation. In general, a t-conorm ⊕ that corresponds to a t-norm ⊗ is defined as {a mathematical formula}a⊕b=1−(1−a)⊗(1−b) for any {a mathematical formula}a,b∈[0,1]. However, Theorem 6 would no longer hold if we were to make such modifications. The main reason is that, in general, a t-norm is not distributive with respect to its corresponding t-conorm.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 3">
       Let us consider the weighted social network {a mathematical formula}N=(U,P,R) shown in Fig. 2(a). The network has four actors x, y, z, u, one attribute P and a fuzzy relation R. The numbers on the nodes represent the membership values of an actor to P and the numbers on the edges represent the membership values of R between two actors. We omit the zero membership values of R, so only non-zero values are shown in the figure. If we define GRE by using the Łukasiewicz t-conorm (i.e., {a mathematical formula}a⊕b=min(a+b,1)) in Eq. (16), then the maximum GRE E partitions the network into two equivalence classes {a mathematical formula}X1={x,y} and {a mathematical formula}X2={z,u}. This can be verified because we have{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}P(x)=P(y)=0.4, and {a mathematical formula}P(z)=P(u)=0.7. However, {a mathematical formula}V(x,〈α〉p)=(0.7⊗0.7)⊕(0.7⊗0.8)=(0.7+0.7−1)+(0.7+0.8−1)=0.9 and {a mathematical formula}V(y,〈α〉p)=(0.9⊗0.7)⊕(0.7⊗0.8)=min((0.9+0.7−1)+(0.7+0.8−1),1)=1. Thus, x and y are not {a mathematical formula}ŁΔ(□◇)-equivalent although {a mathematical formula}x≡Ngy if we use the Łukasiewicz t-conorm in the definition of GRE and the semantics of the modal formulas. Analogously, the network in Fig. 2(b) would be a counterexample of Theorem 6 if we use the product t-conorm (i.e., {a mathematical formula}a⊕b=a+b−a⋅b) in the definition of GRE and the semantics of the modal formulas.  □

       Application to data privacy
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In cloud computing, a user can retrieve information from a data center. Thus, the data stored on cloud servers are valuable information sources. However, privacy concerns usually prevent the sharing of information. How to share information while simultaneously preserving data privacy has generated a great deal of interest recently. The information contained in social network data can be released in at least two ways: (1) by publishing the structural information of the anonymized network; and (2) by answering users' queries regarding non-confidential information about the network.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Consider the following realistic scenario. Assume that a weighted social network {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J) is stored in a data center and for some subset {a mathematical formula}Is⊆I, {a mathematical formula}Pi is a confidential attribute (e.g. a HIV test result) for any {a mathematical formula}i∈Is. To publish the structural information about the network, it is first de-identified so that an isomorphic network {a mathematical formula}N0=(W,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J) is released, where W denotes the set of pseudonyms for the actors in U. In other words, each actor is renamed with a unique pseudonym in W so that there exists a 1–1 and onto mapping {a mathematical formula}de:U→W such that (1) {a mathematical formula}Pi(x)=Pi(de(x)) for any {a mathematical formula}i∈I and {a mathematical formula}x∈U; and (2) {a mathematical formula}Rj(x,y)=Rj(de(x),de(y)) for any {a mathematical formula}j∈J and {a mathematical formula}x,y∈U. This allows the structural information in {a mathematical formula}N to be published accurately without revealing the identifiers of the actors.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       However, an attacker may have access to the non-confidential information about the original network from other data sources. In other words, the attacker may have some background knowledge about the actors in the network. In the logical approach, the background knowledge is represented by the formulas of a logical language. Hence, the attacker can obtain such background knowledge by querying the data sources with the formulas of the language; and the answers are the actors that satisfy the queries (possibly with degrees of satisfaction in the case of the weighted network). Thus, a query language determines whether the queries to the data center are allowable or legal. A more expressive language would allow more detailed information to be released. To restrict queries to the non-confidential part of the network, we assume that the alphabet of the language only contains symbols that denote {a mathematical formula}Pi for {a mathematical formula}i∈I−Is and {a mathematical formula}Rj for {a mathematical formula}j∈J.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The publication of the anonymized network alone would not reveal any confidential information about individual actors. This is because the user can not identify the actor that a pseudonym denotes, i.e., the user does not know what the de-identification mapping de refers to. Moreover, the query-answering process alone does not jeopardize personal privacy because the query language does not contain any symbols that denote the confidential attributes. However, there may be a risk to privacy if the two processes are combined because the query-answering process may help the attacker determine the pseudonym of an actor if he possesses all data in the anonymized network {a mathematical formula}N0. Let {a mathematical formula}L denote the query language. Then, for any query φ (i.e., a formula of {a mathematical formula}L) with respect to the network {a mathematical formula}N, the answer set is {a mathematical formula}ans(φ,N)={(x,deg(x,φ))|x∈U,deg(x,φ)≠0}, where {a mathematical formula}deg(x,φ) is the degree of satisfaction of φ for an actor x. Note that we usually omit the actors that do not satisfy φ at all. Now, the query φ can also be evaluated in the anonymized network {a mathematical formula}N0. Thus, with the answer set, the user can exclude the possibility of {a mathematical formula}de(x)=w if {a mathematical formula}deg(x,φ)≠deg(w,φ) for any {a mathematical formula}x∈U and {a mathematical formula}w∈W. In this way, the user can successively eliminate the possible candidates for the real pseudonym of x. However, no matter how many queries are answered, the user can not eliminate any {a mathematical formula}w∈W that is {a mathematical formula}L-equivalent to {a mathematical formula}de(x). Hence, the final candidate set for the real pseudonym of an actor x is the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence class of W that contains {a mathematical formula}de(x).

       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       Let {a mathematical formula}≡LN denote the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation on the domain of the network {a mathematical formula}N. Then, for a given CWSNP {a mathematical formula}(N,N0,de,L), X is an equivalence class of {a mathematical formula}≡LN iff {a mathematical formula}de(X) is an equivalence class of {a mathematical formula}≡LN0 for any {a mathematical formula}X⊆U. Hence, if the quotient set {a mathematical formula}U/≡LN is {a mathematical formula}{X1,X2,⋯,Xk}, then {a mathematical formula}W/≡LN0 is {a mathematical formula}{de(X1),de(X2),⋯,de(Xk)}. Because de is an isomorphism, we have {a mathematical formula}V(Xi,φ)=V(de(Xi),φ) for {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤k and {a mathematical formula}φ∈L, where the truth value of a formula in an equivalence class is defined in the proof of Theorem 3. Furthermore, for {a mathematical formula}1≤i≠j≤k, there exists a formula {a mathematical formula}φ∈L such that {a mathematical formula}V(Xi,φ)≠V(Xj,φ). This means that an attacker can identify each equivalence class {a mathematical formula}Xi on U with its corresponding equivalence class {a mathematical formula}de(Xi) on W, even though he can not identify {a mathematical formula}de(x) for any individual {a mathematical formula}x∈U. Formally, for a given CWSNP {a mathematical formula}(N,N0,de,L), the total information (potentially) available to an attacker comprises

      <paragraph>
       Note that we do not make any assumption about an attacker's computational power. Hence, an attacker may be not able to derive all the information that is potentially available to him. However, the data center must ensure that privacy is not invaded even though the attacker has unlimited computational power. Thus, to assess the privacy risks of a CWSNP {a mathematical formula}(N,N0,de,L), the data center has to assess if any confidential information can be derived from the above-mentioned information. For example, if there exists an equivalence class {a mathematical formula}X⊆U such that {a mathematical formula}|X|=1, it means that there exists an actor {a mathematical formula}x∈U such that it is possible to uniquely locate {a mathematical formula}de(x) in {a mathematical formula}N0 by querying the data center several times. In this case, we say that the anonymity of x is violated and his/her privacy is invaded. Another case of privacy invasion occurs when there exists an equivalence class {a mathematical formula}X⊆U such that for all {a mathematical formula}u∈X, {a mathematical formula}Pi(u) is the same for some {a mathematical formula}i∈Is. In this case, the attacker knows {a mathematical formula}N0 and X's corresponding equivalence class {a mathematical formula}Y=de(X)⊆W; therefore, he can evaluate the truth value of the confidential attribute {a mathematical formula}Pi with respect to each element of Y and derive that {a mathematical formula}Pi(u)=Pi(w) for any {a mathematical formula}w∈Y and {a mathematical formula}u∈X because de is an isomorphism. Consequently, the attacker can determine the membership value of u in the confidential attribute {a mathematical formula}Pi for any {a mathematical formula}u∈X. In general, the assessment of privacy risk depends on the choice of privacy criteria. Formal definitions of privacy criteria based on the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation can be found in [37], [38].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       From the above analysis, it is clear that the data center must compute the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation on {a mathematical formula}N for the privacy assessment. However, because the number of formulas of a logical language is infinite in general, the direct computation of the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation is not effective. In other words, to directly determine if two actors x and y are {a mathematical formula}L-equivalent, we have to evaluate and compare {a mathematical formula}V(x,φ) and {a mathematical formula}V(y,φ) for each formula φ in {a mathematical formula}L. However, because the number of formulas is infinite, it is impossible to complete the process in a finite number of steps. However, by using the characterization results provided in this paper, the computation of the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation can be reduced to the computation of the corresponding GRE or regular similarity of {a mathematical formula}L. In [27], [28], an effective procedure is presented for the computation of GRE and regular similarity over Gödel structure. More general algorithms that compute GRE and regular similarity over any complete residuated lattices by solving systems of fuzzy relation equations are provided in [16], [17], [39], [40]. Therefore, the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation can be computed effectively. Although the analysis of the complexity of these algorithms and their computational properties are beyond the scope of the paper, we remark that the algorithms are based on an iterative refinement procedure proposed in [7] for computing the coarsest regular equivalence of an ordinary social network, which has {a mathematical formula}O(n3)-time complexity. A more sophisticated algorithm with {a mathematical formula}O(mlog2n)-time complexity exists for an ordinary social network, where m and n are, respectively, the number of links and the number of nodes in the network [45]. Therefore, it would be worthwhile exploring the generalization of this more efficient algorithm to the computation of regular similarity and GRE.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       As an example, let the query language {a mathematical formula}L be a {a mathematical formula}GΔ(□◇) language with the alphabet {a mathematical formula}REL={αj|j∈J} and {a mathematical formula}PV={pi|i∈I−Is}. Then, {a mathematical formula}deg(x,φ) is interpreted as {a mathematical formula}V(x,φ) for the truth valuation V in the Kripke model. In this case, we can simply compute the GRE of the subnetwork {a mathematical formula}N1=(U,(Pi)i∈I−Is,(Rj)j∈J) over a Gödel structure and partition W accordingly. Then, we can check the equivalence classes of the partition and assess the safety of the CWSNP {a mathematical formula}(N,N0,de,GΔ(□◇)). If privacy violations are detected, we can try to use a less expressive query language or sanitize the network structure before it is released; however, concrete sanitization techniques are beyond the scope of this paper. In general, our results show that the computation of {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence can be reduced to the computation of GRE if the query language {a mathematical formula}L is one of the languages mentioned in Theorem 3, Theorem 4; and it can be reduced to the computation of regular similarity if the query language is {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) or {a mathematical formula}G(◇).

       Many-valued modal logics have been motivated by different application contexts in the literature. One of the earliest systems was the modal logic valued on finite Heyting algebra introduced by Fitting [29], [30], who also provided a multi-expert interpretation of the logic. More recently, the minimum modal logic over a finite residuated lattice (RL) was systematically studied in [8], where □-fragments of both finite RL-valued modal logics with truth constants and finite MV chain-valued modal logics without truth constants were axiomatized.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       While the many-valued modal logics considered in [8], [29], [30] are quite general, they tend to concentrate on the finite-valued case. For the infinite-valued case, the formalization of the {a mathematical formula}[0,1]-valued modal systems S5 and KD45 is investigated in [31], [33]. However, these systems impose special constraints on the fuzzy accessibility relations of the Kripke models. For example, the fuzzy S5 system requires that the fuzzy accessibility relation is the universal relation. In recent years, the general framework for Gödel modal logic has also been studied extensively. The □-fragment and ◇-fragment of different Gödel modal systems, including K, D, T, S4, and S5, are axiomatized in [12]; and the full Gödel modal logics K, T, S4, and S5 are axiomatized in [13]. Moreover, analytic proof methods for the □-fragment and ◇-fragment of the fuzzy K system, including sequent-of-relations and hypersequent calculi, are introduced in [53]. In addition to complete axiomatizations, the finite model property and the decidability of Gödel modal logics are investigated in [11], [12], [13], [53]. Syntactically, our modal language {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) is simply a multi-modal extension of the Gödel modal logics presented in [11], [12], [13], [53]. However, the different syntax is inessential because each α-modality is interpreted in the same way. In fact, there also exist works on fuzzy description logics [4], [5], [32], that are inter-translatable with our {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) language. However, it seems that the modal logics extended with Baaz Delta operator and involutive negation have not been explored.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Irrespective of whether the logics we consider in this paper have been presented in the literature, the focus of our work is quite different from existing studies, which are mainly concerned with the development of deductive systems for the logics. Hence, there is a dearth of works on the investigation of bisimulation and the resultant modal invariance results. The only exception is the notion of weak bisimulation for Heyting-valued modal logics introduced in [23]. In Section 5.1, we showed that weak bisimulation on a weighted social network (regarded as a model of many-valued modal logics) is equivalent to the family of c-cuts of the maximum regular similarity. However, to the best of our knowledge, the notion of GRE and its corresponding modal invariance results were not investigated before.

       Since the pioneering work of Sweeney [60], [61], [62], the application of privacy-preserving data publication (PPDP) to data privacy has rapidly evolved into an active research area in computer science. Initially, the objective of PPDP was to prevent an attacker from inferring private information by using a published data table. While most early works on PPDP focused on the publication of tabulated data, privacy-preserving publication of social networks has received a great deal of attention in recent years [35], [50], [55], [68], [67].

       Generally, the cited studies assume that an attacker could use some background knowledge to compromise an individual's privacy by analyzing the released anonymized network. With different types of background knowledge, an attacker can launch different privacy attacks. In [37], [38], Hsu et al. propose a logical framework that unifies existing attack models by considering each type of attack as a subset of admissible queries in a logical language. The main computational task of the framework is to find the indiscernibility relation on the set of actors with respect to admissible queries. It is shown that the modal invariance results of regular equivalence and exact equivalence facilitate efficient computation with respect to query languages based on description logic. In this paper, we show that the framework can be extended to weighted social network. We also demonstrate that the effective computation of indiscernibility relations with respect to several query languages based on many-valued modal logics can be achieved by using existing algorithms to compute regular similarity or GRE.

       In addition to anonymizing individual identities, link weight anonymization has been proposed as an effective technique for privacy protection of weighted social networks [18], [19]. The technique modifies the weights on links of a network while preserving some properties of the network. The properties to be preserved depend on the type of application. Although our results are mainly applied to privacy risk assessment, link weight anonymization can be regarded as a kind of network sanitization technique if our approach detects privacy violation. However, it seems that assessing the privacy risk of a network after link weight anonymization does not fit into the framework proposed in [37], [38]. Thus, our results can not be applied straightforwardly and further investigation is needed in order to incorporate the technique into the logical framework.

      Concluding remarks
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      The notion of regular equivalence has been studied extensively in social network analysis, and it has found many applications in block modeling, network clustering, role or position identification, and so on. To represent the intensity of ties and interactions between actors, traditional social networks have been generalized to weighted social networks. There exist different, but equivalent, definitions of regular equivalence in the literature. However, when generalized to weighted social networks, the definitions may result in different notions of similarity. Two kinds of generalizations based on the Gödel t-norm, called regular similarity and generalized regular equivalence (GRE), were proposed in [28]. Regular similarity is generalized based on the commutativity between the similarity relation and the underlying fuzzy relation; while GRE is generalized according to the equivalence of the neighborhoods of equivalent nodes. The definition of regular similarity was further generalized to arbitrary residuated lattices in [16].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In this paper, we show that many-valued modal logic can characterize regular similarity or GRE in weighted social networks. By regarding a weighted social network as a model of many-valued modal logic, similar or equivalent actors satisfy the set of modal logic formulas to the same degree. Specifically, the many-valued modal logic {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) based on the Gödel t-norm characterizes regular similarity in the sense that the degree of similarity between two actors is equal to the fuzzy equivalence of the actors' truth degrees for any formulas of the logic. In addition, the extensions of {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) with the involutive negation or projection operators characterize GRE in the sense that two actors are equivalent iff they satisfy any formulas of the logics to the same degree. For a special kind of weighted social network, called a hybrid social network, in which all the actors' attributes are crisp, although their ties may be weighted, we also show its logical characterization by a modal version of possibilistic logic, called QML. Furthermore, we show that the characterizations of GRE can be extended to many-valued modal logics based on the Łukasiewicz and product t-norms, while the extensions for regular similarity have negative results. Finally, we demonstrate a potential application of the logical characterizations to privacy-preserving data publication for weighted social networks.
