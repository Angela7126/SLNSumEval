      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Inconsistency measurement is about the quantitative assessment of the severity of inconsistencies in knowledge bases. Consider the following two knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K1 and {a mathematical formula}K2 formalized in propositional logic:{a mathematical formula} Both knowledge bases are classically inconsistent as for {a mathematical formula}K1 we have {a mathematical formula}{a,¬a∧¬b}⊨⊥ and for {a mathematical formula}K2 we have, e.g., {a mathematical formula}{a,¬a}⊨⊥. These inconsistencies render the whole knowledge bases useless for reasoning if one wants to use classical reasoning techniques. In order to make the knowledge bases useful again, one can either rely on non-monotonic/paraconsistent reasoning techniques [23], [27] or one revises the knowledge bases appropriately to make them consistent [9]. Looking at the knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K1 and {a mathematical formula}K2 one can observe that the severity of their inconsistency is different. In {a mathematical formula}K1, only two out of four formulas (a and {a mathematical formula}¬a∧¬b) are “participating” in making {a mathematical formula}K1 inconsistent while for {a mathematical formula}K2 all formulas contribute to its inconsistency. Furthermore, for {a mathematical formula}K1 only two propositions (a and b) are conflicting and using e.g. paraconsistent reasoning one could still infer meaningful statements about c and d. For {a mathematical formula}K2 no such statement can be made. This leads to the assessment that {a mathematical formula}K2 should be regarded more inconsistent than {a mathematical formula}K1.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Inconsistency measures can be used to analyze inconsistencies and to provide insights on how to repair them. An inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}I is a function on knowledge bases, such that the larger the value {a mathematical formula}I(K) the more severe the inconsistency in {a mathematical formula}K. A lot of different approaches of inconsistency measures have been proposed, mostly for classical propositional logic [10], [12], [13], [22], [25], [32], [7], [8], [24], [15], but also for classical first-order logic [6], description logics [21], [33], default logics [5], and probabilistic and other weighted logics [19], [30], [26]. Due to this plethora of inconsistency measures it is hard to determine which measure to use for an application and which measure is meaningful. Rationality postulates have been proposed that address the issue of assessing the quality of a measure—see e.g. [11], [25]—but many of these properties have been criticized to address only a specific point of view, see [2] for a recent discussion on this topic.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In this paper, we take a different perspective on the evaluation of inconsistency measures by considering a quantitative analysis of their expressivity, that is, we study how many different (inconsistent) knowledge bases can be distinguished by a given inconsistency measure. By the term expressivity we here refer to the property of a semantical concept—here, an inconsistency measure—and its capability to distinguish syntactical constructs—here, knowledge bases—, similarly as it has been done for the analysis of expressivity of semantics for other logical languages, see e.g. skepticism relations for formal argumentation [1]. Our analysis is meant to complement the study on rationality postulates and is, of course, not meaningful on its own as the compliance of measures with the basic intuitions behind inconsistency measures can only be assessed by rationality postulates. However, we introduce expressivity of inconsistency measures as an additional method to evaluate their quality. In particular, we propose four different expressivity characteristics that quantify the relation between the number of different values of an inconsistency measure wrt. different notions of the size of the knowledge base, such as number of formulas or number of propositions. We conduct a thorough comparative analysis of 16 different inconsistency measures from the literature [12], [13], [7], [17], [31], [8], [25], [16], [32], [5] and classify these measures in a hierarchy of expressivity. In our study, we made several interesting observations, such as the relation between the measure {a mathematical formula}IMI[7] and Sperner families [28] and of the measure {a mathematical formula}IMIC[7] with profiles of Boolean functions. One of our results is that the distance-based measure {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ from Grant and Hunter [8] and the proof-based measure {a mathematical formula}IPm from Jabbour and Raddaoui [16] have maximal expressivity along all considered characteristics.

      Preliminaries
     </section-title>
     <paragraph label="Definition 1">
      Let {a mathematical formula}At be some fixed propositional signature, i.e., a (possibly infinite) set of propositions, and let {a mathematical formula}L(At) be the corresponding propositional language constructed using the usual connectives ∧ (and), ∨ (or), and ¬ (negation). A knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K is a finite set of formulas {a mathematical formula}K⊆L(At). Let {a mathematical formula}K be the set of all knowledge bases. If X is a formula or a set of formulas we write {a mathematical formula}At(X) to denote the set of propositions appearing in X. Semantics to a propositional language is given by interpretations and an interpretation ω on {a mathematical formula}At is a function {a mathematical formula}ω:At→{true,false}. Let {a mathematical formula}Ω(At) denote the set of all interpretations for {a mathematical formula}At. An interpretation ω satisfies (or is a model of) a proposition {a mathematical formula}a∈At, denoted by {a mathematical formula}ω⊨a, if and only if {a mathematical formula}ω(a)=true. The satisfaction relation ⊨ is extended to formulas in the usual way.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      As an abbreviation we sometimes identify an interpretation ω with its complete conjunction, i.e., if {a mathematical formula}a1,…,an∈At are those propositions that are assigned {a mathematical formula}true by ω and {a mathematical formula}an+1,…,am∈At are those propositions that are assigned {a mathematical formula}false by ω we identify ω by {a mathematical formula}a1…anan+1‾…am‾ (or any permutation of this). For example, the interpretation {a mathematical formula}ω1 on {a mathematical formula}{a,b,c} with {a mathematical formula}ω(a)=ω(c)=true and {a mathematical formula}ω(b)=false is abbreviated by {a mathematical formula}ab‾c.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      For {a mathematical formula}Φ⊆L(At) we also define {a mathematical formula}ω⊨Φ if and only if {a mathematical formula}ω⊨ϕ for every {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Φ. Define furthermore the set of models {a mathematical formula}Mod(X)={ω∈Ω(At)|ω⊨X} for every formula or set of formulas X. If {a mathematical formula}Mod(X)=∅ we also write {a mathematical formula}X⊨⊥ and say that X is inconsistent.

      Inconsistency measures
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Let {a mathematical formula}R≥0∞ be the set of non-negative real values including ∞. Inconsistency measures are functions {a mathematical formula}I:K→R≥0∞ that aim at assessing the severity of the inconsistency in a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K, cf. [7]. The basic idea is that the larger the inconsistency in {a mathematical formula}K the larger the value {a mathematical formula}I(K) and {a mathematical formula}I(K)=0 if and only if {a mathematical formula}K is consistent. However, inconsistency is a concept that is not easily quantified and there have been a couple of proposals for inconsistency measures so far, in particular for classical propositional logic, see e.g. [2], [24], [15], [14] for some recent works. We selected 16 inconsistency measures from the literature in order to conduct our analysis on expressivity, taken from [12], [13], [7], [17], [31], [8], [25], [16], [32], [5]. We briefly introduce these measures in this section for the sake of completeness, but we refer for a detailed explanation to the corresponding original papers.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Example 1">
      To illustrate the different inconsistency measures we will use the knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K1 and {a mathematical formula}K2 from the introduction as running examples. Let {a mathematical formula}At={a,b,c,d} and define knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K1 and {a mathematical formula}K2 as follows:{a mathematical formula} A summary of the formal definitions of the considered inconsistency measures can be found in Table 1. We will discuss these measures in more detail below.

       The drastic inconsistency measure
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The basic motivation for measuring inconsistency is to provide a graded assessment of inconsistency and not only a “consistent”/“inconsistent” assessment. However, in order to evaluate more sophisticated measures and the usefulness of rationality postulates (cf. beginning of Section 4), the drastic inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Id—that can only distinguish between consistent and inconsistent knowledge bases—is usually used as a baseline approach, cf. e.g. [12].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 2">
       The drastic inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Id:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. In other words, {a mathematical formula}Id(K)=1 if and only if {a mathematical formula}K is inconsistent (and 0 otherwise).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 2">
       We continue Example 1 and consider{a mathematical formula} As both {a mathematical formula}K1 and {a mathematical formula}K2 are inconsistent we obtain {a mathematical formula}Id(K1)=Id(K2)=1.

       Inconsistency measures based on minimal inconsistencies
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       One approach to assess the severity of inconsistency in a knowledge base is to focus on its set of minimal inconsistent subsets. A set {a mathematical formula}M⊆K is called minimal inconsistent subset (MI) of {a mathematical formula}K if {a mathematical formula}M⊨⊥ and there is no {a mathematical formula}M′⊂M with {a mathematical formula}M′⊨⊥. Let {a mathematical formula}MI(K) be the set of all MIs of {a mathematical formula}K. Informally speaking, minimal inconsistent subsets contain the essence of the inconsistency in a knowledge base. Every formula participating in creating an inconsistency is part of at least one minimal inconsistent subset.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 4">
       A straightforward approach to use minimal inconsistent subsets for measuring inconsistency is to take their number as an indicator [12]. The {a mathematical formula}MI-inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}IMI:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. One drawback of {a mathematical formula}IMI is that it treats every inconsistent subset of {a mathematical formula}K equally. A knowledge base with one minimal inconsistent subset of size 2 has the same inconsistency value as another knowledge base with one minimal inconsistent subset of size 10. It is usually acknowledged that a smaller minimal inconsistent subset is more severe than a larger one, cf. [12]. The {a mathematical formula}MIcinconsistency measure takes this into account and is defined as follows. The {a mathematical formula}MIc-inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}IMIC:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. In other words, for every minimal inconsistent subset M of {a mathematical formula}K, {a mathematical formula}1/|M| is added up in order to obtain {a mathematical formula}IMIC(K). In this way, larger minimal inconsistent subset contribute less to the overall inconsistency value than smaller ones. We continue Example 1 and consider{a mathematical formula} Here we have{a mathematical formula} Therefore we obtain {a mathematical formula}IMI(K1)=1 and {a mathematical formula}IMI(K2)=2 and{a mathematical formula} The measure {a mathematical formula}IMIC has been further extended in [25] where not only the sizes of the different minimal inconsistent subsets but also their distribution in a knowledge base has been considered. For every knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K and {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,|K|, define{a mathematical formula} That is, {a mathematical formula}MIi(K) is the set of minimal inconsistent subsets of {a mathematical formula}K of size i and {a mathematical formula}CN(i)(K) is the set of consistent subsets of {a mathematical formula}K of size i. Furthermore define{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,|K|. The value {a mathematical formula}Ri(K) thus gives the ratio of minimal inconsistent sets of size i to the number of minimal inconsistent and consistent subsets of size i. Obviously, if for two knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K and {a mathematical formula}K′, a value {a mathematical formula}Ri(K) is larger than {a mathematical formula}Ri(K′) (for some i and everything else being equal) than {a mathematical formula}K should be regarded more inconsistent than {a mathematical formula}K′. The idea of the approach of Mu et al. [25] is to weigh these values also wrt. the sizes, i.e., a large {a mathematical formula}Ri(K) has more impact than a large {a mathematical formula}Rj(K), with {a mathematical formula}j&gt;i. The {a mathematical formula}Df-inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}IDf:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. Note that the above definition of {a mathematical formula}IDf represents only a single instance of the family introduced in [25]. Other variants can be obtained by other ways of aggregating the values {a mathematical formula}R1(K),…,R|K|(K). We continue Example 3 and recall{a mathematical formula} Then we have{a mathematical formula} Furthermore, we have{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} yielding{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula}Finally, we obtain{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 6">
       Another simple approach for utilizing minimal inconsistent subsets is to use the number of formulas occurring in some minimal inconsistent subsets—that is, the number of problematic formulas—as the inconsistency value, cf. e.g. [7]. The problematic inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Ip:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 5">
       We continue Example 3 and recall{a mathematical formula} Then {a mathematical formula}Ip(K1)=2 and {a mathematical formula}Ip(K2)=4.

       Inconsistency measures based on maximal consistency
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Another family closely related to the family of measures based on minimal inconsistent subsets is the one based on maximal consistent subsets. Let {a mathematical formula}MC(K) be the set of maximal consistent subsets of {a mathematical formula}K, i.e.{a mathematical formula} Note, that a maximal consistent subset can be obtained by removing one formula from each minimal inconsistent subset from the knowledge base. Thus, the number of maximal consistent subsets and the number of minimal inconsistent sets correlate.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 7">
       Furthermore, let {a mathematical formula}SC(K) be the set of self-contradictory formulas of {a mathematical formula}K, i.e.{a mathematical formula} An inconsistency measure that takes both maximal consistent subsets and self-contradictory formulas into account can be defined as follows, cf. e.g. [7]. The {a mathematical formula}MC-inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Imc:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. Note that the subtraction of 1 in the definition of {a mathematical formula}Imc is to ensure that a consistent knowledge base has inconsistency value 0 (a consistent knowledge base has one maximal consistent subset, itself, and no self-contradictory formulas).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Another approach utilizing the idea of maximum consistency is the approach of Doder et al. [5].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 6">
       The nc-inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Inc:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. In other words, the inconsistency of {a mathematical formula}K is assessed by seeking a maximal value {a mathematical formula}n∈{1,…,|K|} such that all subsets of size n of {a mathematical formula}K are consistent. The larger this value n, the smaller the inconsistency. Note that the above definition of {a mathematical formula}Inc differs from the original definition in [5] (where only the max-term was considered) in order to ensure that consistent knowledge bases receive a value of zero and the inconsistency value increases with increasing inconsistency. We continue Example 1 and consider{a mathematical formula} Here we have{a mathematical formula} and {a mathematical formula}SC(K1)=SC(K2)=∅. Therefore we obtain{a mathematical formula} Furthermore, note that for both {a mathematical formula}K1 and {a mathematical formula}K2 we can find subsets of size 2 that are inconsistent: {a mathematical formula}{a,¬a∧¬b} for {a mathematical formula}K1 and {a mathematical formula}{a,¬a} for {a mathematical formula}K2. Furthermore, all one-element subsets of {a mathematical formula}K1 and {a mathematical formula}K2 are consistent, respectively. Therefore, we obtain{a mathematical formula}

       Probabilistic inconsistency measures
      </section-title>
      <paragraph label="Definition 9">
       One of the first approaches to measuring inconsistency is Knight's measure {a mathematical formula}Iη, which is based on probability functions over the underlying propositional language [17]. Recall that {a mathematical formula}Ω(At) is the set of interpretations of the propositional language {a mathematical formula}L(At). A probability function P on {a mathematical formula}L(At) is a function {a mathematical formula}P:Ω(At)→[0,1] with {a mathematical formula}∑ω∈Ω(At)P(ω)=1. We extend P to assign a probability to any formula {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈L(At) by defining{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula}P(At) be the set of all those probability functions. The idea of Knight [17] is to seek a probability function that maximizes the probability of each formula of a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K. If we can find a probability function that assigns probability 1 to each formula this means that the knowledge base is consistent. If the knowledge base is inconsistent, then the probability mass must be distributed (recall that an inconsistent set of formulas cannot be satisfied by a single interpretation ω; thus the probability {a mathematical formula}P(ω) can only be associated with a subset of this set). Therefore, the smaller the maximal probability that can be assigned to all formulas the more inconsistent the knowledge base. The η-inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Iη:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. Note that we modified the definition of {a mathematical formula}Iη slightly compared to the original definition in order to ensure that consistent knowledge bases receive an inconsistency value of zero.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 7">
       Instead of seeking a probability function to maximize the probabilities of the formulas in {a mathematical formula}K, one can simplify this idea and seek only a minimal set of interpretations that need to receive a positive probability in order to ensure that every formula has a positive probability [31]. In other words, a subset {a mathematical formula}H⊆Ω(At) is called a hitting set of {a mathematical formula}K if for every {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K there is {a mathematical formula}ω∈H with {a mathematical formula}ω⊨ϕ. Focusing only on minimizing the number of interpretations needed to form a hitting set we can define another measure as follows. The hitting-set inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Ihs:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K with {a mathematical formula}min⁡∅=∞. Note that {a mathematical formula}Ihs(K)=∞ if and only if {a mathematical formula}K contains a self-contradictory formula, i.e., {a mathematical formula}α∈K with {a mathematical formula}α⊨⊥. In this case, no hitting set of {a mathematical formula}K exists. We continue Example 1 and consider{a mathematical formula} Consider the probability function {a mathematical formula}P1∈P({a,b,c,d}) defined via{a mathematical formula} Then we obtain{a mathematical formula} and thus {a mathematical formula}P1(ϕ)≥0.5 for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K1. Furthermore, there can be no other {a mathematical formula}P′ that assigns larger probability to all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K1. Hence, we have {a mathematical formula}Iη(K1)=1−0.5=0.5. The function {a mathematical formula}P1 can also be used to determine {a mathematical formula}Iη(K2)=0.5.The set {a mathematical formula}H1={abcd,a‾b‾cd} is also a hitting set of both {a mathematical formula}K1 and {a mathematical formula}K2 and there is no smaller set that is a hitting set. Therefore we obtain {a mathematical formula}Ihs(K1)=Ihs(K2)=1.

       Variable-based inconsistency measures
      </section-title>
      <paragraph label="Definition 11">
       Another approach to assess the severity of inconsistency is to take the number of propositions from {a mathematical formula}At that participate in the inconsistency. The approach of Xiao and Ma [32] is to take the ratio of the propositions appearing in a minimal inconsistent subset wrt. the total number of propositions as the inconsistency value. The mv inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Imv:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. In other words, {a mathematical formula}Imv(K) is the ratio of the signature involved in minimal inconsistent subsets.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Instead of utilizing minimal inconsistent subsets one can also using paraconsistent semantics to identify the part of the signature involved in inconsistency. In this paper, we will only consider the contension measure{a mathematical formula}Ic—cf. e.g. [7]—and its normalized variant {a mathematical formula}ILPm from [13] as representatives of this family of measures. Similar approaches relying on the same ideas can be found in e.g. [21], [20].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 8">
       The contension measure {a mathematical formula}Ic utilizes three-valued interpretations for propositional logic [27]. A three-valued interpretation υ on {a mathematical formula}At is a function {a mathematical formula}υ:At→{T,F,B} where the values T and F correspond to the classical {a mathematical formula}true and {a mathematical formula}false, respectively. The additional truth value B stands for both and is meant to represent a conflicting truth value for a proposition. The function υ is extended to arbitrary formulas as shown in Table 2. Then, an interpretation υ satisfies a formula α, denoted by {a mathematical formula}υ⊨3α if either {a mathematical formula}υ(α)=T or {a mathematical formula}υ(α)=B. Then inconsistency can be measured by seeking an interpretation υ that assigns B to a minimal number of propositions. The contension inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Ic:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. In [13] a variant {a mathematical formula}ILPm of this measure was defined that further normalizes the inconsistency value by the number of propositions appearing in {a mathematical formula}K. The normalized contension inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}ILPm:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K.We continue Example 1 and consider{a mathematical formula} and recall{a mathematical formula} Then we have{a mathematical formula} Furthermore, consider {a mathematical formula}υ1:{a,b,c,d}→{T,F,B} defined via{a mathematical formula} Then {a mathematical formula}υ1⊨3ϕ for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K1 and there is no other {a mathematical formula}υ′ that assigns B to fewer propositions, yielding {a mathematical formula}Ic(K1)=1 and {a mathematical formula}ILPm(K1)=1/4. For {a mathematical formula}υ2:{a,b}→{T,F,B} defined via{a mathematical formula} we have {a mathematical formula}υ2⊨3ϕ for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K2 and there is no other {a mathematical formula}υ′ that assigns B to fewer propositions, yielding {a mathematical formula}Ic(K2)=2 and {a mathematical formula}ILPm(K2)=2/2=1.

       Distance-based inconsistency measures
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In [8] three families of inconsistency measures are defined that are based on a notion of distance to consistency. More precisely, an interpretation distance d is a function {a mathematical formula}d:Ω(At)×Ω(At)→[0,∞) that satisfies (let {a mathematical formula}ω,ω′,ω″∈Ω(At))
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="1.">
        {a mathematical formula}d(ω,ω′)=0 if and only if {a mathematical formula}ω=ω′ (reflexivity),
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="2.">
        {a mathematical formula}d(ω,ω′)=d(ω′,ω) (symmetry), and
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="3.">
        {a mathematical formula}d(ω,ω″)≤d(ω,ω′)+d(ω′,ω″) (triangle inequality).
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       One prominent example of such a distance is the Dalal distance{a mathematical formula}dd defined via{a mathematical formula} for all {a mathematical formula}ω,ω′∈Ω(At). In other words, {a mathematical formula}dd(ω,ω′) is the number of propositions where ω and {a mathematical formula}ω′ assign different truth values. If {a mathematical formula}X⊆Ω(At) is a set of interpretations we define {a mathematical formula}dd(X,ω)=minω′∈X⁡dd(ω′,ω) (if {a mathematical formula}X=∅ we define {a mathematical formula}dd(X,ω)=∞). While [8] consider arbitrary distances, we will focus here on the Dalal distance for reasons of simplicity.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The basic idea of the approaches in [8] is to measure and aggregate the distances of the models of the formulas in a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K. For example, if a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K has two formulas and their models have a large distance to each other, then {a mathematical formula}K should be regarded as more inconsistent compared to a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K′ with two formulas, where this is not the case. More precisely, the first approach from [8] considered here seeks an interpretation ω such that the sum of all distances of the sets of models to ω is minimal.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 9">
       The Σ-distance inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. Another approach of [8] is to seek an interpretation ω such that the maximum distance of the sets of models is minimal. The max-distance inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Idalalmax:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K. The final approach of [8] is to minimize the number of formulas, where their corresponding sets of models have a positive distance. The hit-distance inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Idalalhit:K→R≥0∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K∈K.We continue Example 1 and consider{a mathematical formula} Observe that for the interpretation {a mathematical formula}ω1=ab‾cd∈Ω({a,b,c,d}) we have{a mathematical formula} and therefore {a mathematical formula}∑α∈K1dd(Mod(α),ω1)=1. There is no other interpretation {a mathematical formula}ω′ with a smaller total distance, so we have {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ(K1)=1. Furthermore, we have {a mathematical formula}maxα∈K1⁡dd(Mod(α),ω1)=1 and there is also no other interpretation {a mathematical formula}ω′ with a smaller maximum distance. Hence, we have {a mathematical formula}Idalalmax(K1)=1 and similarly {a mathematical formula}Idalalhit(K1)=1. For {a mathematical formula}K2 we obtain{a mathematical formula} with a similar argumentation as above. For {a mathematical formula}Idalalhit(K2) observe that every interpretation ω must always falsify exactly one formula in {a mathematical formula}{a,¬a} and exactly one formula in {a mathematical formula}{b,¬b}. Therefore we obtain {a mathematical formula}Idalalhit(K2)=2.

       Proof-based inconsistency measures
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The final measure we consider in this paper is the proof-based measure from [16]. The basic idea is to count, for all propositions {a mathematical formula}x∈At, both the number of minimal proofs for x and its negation ¬x. If there are many proofs for both, this indicates a large inconsistency in the knowledge base. In the context of [16] a minimal proof for {a mathematical formula}α∈{x,¬x|x∈At} in {a mathematical formula}K is a set {a mathematical formula}π⊆K such that
      </paragraph>

       Note that this definition does not require that π is consistent. In particular, the set {a mathematical formula}{a∧¬a} is a minimal proof for both a and ¬a. Note furthermore, that item 1.) requires that α appears in the exact same form in π, e.g. a appears in {a mathematical formula}a∧b but not in {a mathematical formula}¬a∧b (this is a syntactic criterion).

       Let {a mathematical formula}PmK(x) be the set of all minimal proofs of x in {a mathematical formula}K. The proof-based measure of Jabbour and Raddaoui [16] can then be defined by summing up the products of the number of minimal proofs for complementary literals.

      Expressivity characteristics
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      In the literature, inconsistency measures are usually analytically evaluated on a set of rationality postulates.{sup:2} Some basic example postulates given in [11] are the following (let {a mathematical formula}I be any inconsistency measure) Consistency{a mathematical formula}I(K)=0 if and only if {a mathematical formula}K is consistentMonotonyif {a mathematical formula}K⊆K′ then {a mathematical formula}I(K)≤I(K′)Independencefor all {a mathematical formula}α∈K, if {a mathematical formula}α∉M for every {a mathematical formula}M∈MI(K) then {a mathematical formula}I(K)=I(K∖{α}) Satisfaction of the property consistency ensures that all consistent knowledge bases receive a minimal inconsistency value and every inconsistent knowledge base receives a positive inconsistency value (we already implicitly required satisfaction of this postulate in the definition of an inconsistency measure). The postulate monotony states that the value of inconsistency can only increase when adding new information. Independence states that removing “harmless” formulas from a knowledge base does not change the value of inconsistency. Besides these three postulates a series of other postulates have been proposed in the literature, see e.g. [11], [25], [2]. However, some of these postulates are disputed as each of them usually covers only a single aspect of inconsistency, such as independence, which focuses on the role of minimal inconsistent subsets. An excellent discussion on the rationality of various postulates for inconsistency measures can be found in [2]. Besides Besnard, several other authors have also criticized the rationality of individual postulates—discussions can be found in almost all papers cited before—and so there is some disagreement on which postulates are meaningful and which are not. One the one hand this calls for more work on rationality postulates and, on the other hand, it also suggests to investigate additional means for comparison. In the following, we propose a novel quantitative approach to evaluate and compare inconsistency measures that aims at complementing the existing approach of rationality postulates.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 19">
      The drastic inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}Id (see Table 1) is usually considered as a very naive baseline approach for inconsistency measurement. Surprisingly, this measure already satisfies many rationality postulates such as consistency, monotony, and independence (the proofs are straightforward). What sets it apart from other more sophisticated inconsistency measures is that it cannot differentiate between different inconsistent knowledge bases. However, this demand is exactly what inconsistency measures are supposed to satisfy. While the qualitative behavior of inconsistency measures is being discussed quite deeply using rationality postulates, their quantitative properties in terms of expressivity have been almost neglected so far.{sup:3} With expressivity of inconsistency measures we here mean the number of different values an inconsistency measure can attain. We investigate the expressivity of inconsistency measures along four different dimensions of subclasses of knowledge bases. Let ϕ be a formula. The length{a mathematical formula}l(ϕ) of ϕ is recursively defined as{a mathematical formula}Define the following subclasses of the set of all knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K:{a mathematical formula}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In other words, {a mathematical formula}Kv(n) is the set of all knowledge bases that mention at most n different propositions, {a mathematical formula}Kf(n) is the set of all knowledge bases that contain at most n formulas, {a mathematical formula}Kl(n) is the set of all knowledge bases that contain only formulas with maximal length n, and {a mathematical formula}Kp(n) is the set of all knowledge bases that contain only formulas that mention at most n different propositions each. The motivation for considering these particular subclasses of knowledge bases is that each of them considers a different aspect of the size of a knowledge base. As a syntactical object, a knowledge base is a set of formulas, and both the number of formulas (considered by the class {a mathematical formula}Kf(n)) and the length of each formula ({a mathematical formula}Kl(n)) are the essential parameters that define its size. From a semantical point of view, the number of propositions appearing in each formula ({a mathematical formula}Kp(n)) and in the complete knowledge base ({a mathematical formula}Kv(n)) define the scope of the knowledge. Larger numbers for both of them also indicate larger scope and thus greater size. Inconsistency measures should adhere to the size of the knowledge base in terms of their expressivity. For example, the number of possible inconsistency values of a particular measure should not decrease when moving from a set {a mathematical formula}Kv(n) to set {a mathematical formula}Kv(n′) with {a mathematical formula}n′&gt;n, as knowledge bases with {a mathematical formula}n′ formulas should provide a larger variety in terms of inconsistency as knowledge bases of size n. Indeed, this property is true for all considered measures as {a mathematical formula}Kv(n)⊆Kv(n′) (the same holds for all classes above).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Example 11">
      The aim of our expressivity analysis is to investigate the number of different values that a specific inconsistency measure can attain on different subclasses of knowledge bases. We formalize this idea using expressivity characteristics as follows. Let {a mathematical formula}I be an inconsistency measure and {a mathematical formula}n&gt;0. Let {a mathematical formula}α∈{v,f,l,p}. The α-characteristic{a mathematical formula}Cα(I,n) of {a mathematical formula}I wrt. n is defined as{a mathematical formula} In other words, {a mathematical formula}Cα(I,n) is the number of different inconsistency values {a mathematical formula}I assigns to knowledge bases from {a mathematical formula}Kα(n). Note that these characteristics are not always the same as the maximal value of an inconsistency measure on a specific set of knowledge bases, even if the codomain of the measure is the natural numbers. Indeed, it can be the case that intermediate values cannot be attained. Consider {a mathematical formula}Iη which has the codomain {a mathematical formula}[0,1] as each value {a mathematical formula}Iη(K) can be associated with a probability value, cf. Table 1. In Knight [17] it has already been shown that {a mathematical formula}Iη(K) is always a rational number, so {a mathematical formula}2/2∉ImIη.{sup:4} Furthermore, the possible values of {a mathematical formula}Iη are further constrained when considering specific subclasses from above. For example, for every arbitrary knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K which contains at most 2 formulas, the only possible values of {a mathematical formula}Iη(K) are 0, 1/2, 1, so we have {a mathematical formula}Cf(Iη,2)=3.

      We now come to the main contribution of this paper, which is a thorough study of the 16 considered inconsistency measures in terms of our four proposed expressivity characteristics.

      The complete proof of the above theorem can be found in Appendix A. However, some of these proofs provide some interesting insights into the behavior of particular inconsistency measures and provide relations to other specific mathematical branches.

       Sperner families and minimal inconsistent sets
      </section-title>
      <paragraph label="Definition 21">
       Many of the inconsistency measures discussed above use the notion of minimal inconsistent subset as a central tool for assessing the inconsistency of a knowledge base. In its simplest implementation, the inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}IMI is defined to be exactly the number of the minimal inconsistent subsets of a knowledge base. Accordingly, in order to determine the number {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMI,n) it is necessary to investigate how many different minimal inconsistent subsets a knowledge base with n formulas may possess. This question has already been investigated from a more abstract perspective in set theory under the notion of Sperner families (also called independent systems). Let {a mathematical formula}S={S1,…,Sn} with {a mathematical formula}n≥1 be a family of sets over a set {a mathematical formula}X≠∅, i.e., {a mathematical formula}Si⊆X for all {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,n. The family S is called a Sperner family over X if for all {a mathematical formula}S,S′∈S with {a mathematical formula}S≠S′, {a mathematical formula}S⊈S′.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In other words, {a mathematical formula}S is a Sperner family if none of its elements is contained in another. It can easily be seen that for every inconsistent knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K the set {a mathematical formula}MI(K) is also a Sperner family over {a mathematical formula}K: for {a mathematical formula}M,M′∈MI(K) with {a mathematical formula}M≠M′ it cannot hold {a mathematical formula}M⊆M′, otherwise {a mathematical formula}M′ would not be a minimal inconsistent set. Note that a consistent knowledge base yields {a mathematical formula}MI(K)=∅ which is not covered by the above definition.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 2">
       As {a mathematical formula}MI(K) is a Sperner family over {a mathematical formula}K its maximal cardinality is bounded by the maximal cardinality of any Sperner family over {a mathematical formula}K. For the latter we have the following result. (See[28].) Let X be a set with{a mathematical formula}n=|X|.
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="1.">
        There is a Sperner family{a mathematical formula}Smaxover X with{a mathematical formula}|Smax|=(n⌊n/2⌋).{sup:5}

       <list-item label="2.">
        For every Sperner family{a mathematical formula}S′over X,{a mathematical formula}|S′|≤|Smax|.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       A corollary of the above theorem is that {a mathematical formula}|MI(K)|≤(|K|⌊|K|/2⌋) for every knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K. Also taking into account that {a mathematical formula}|MI(K)| is always a non-negative integer we can directly entail {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMI,n)≤(n⌊n/2⌋)+1 (the addition of 1 is due to the fact that a consistent knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K yields {a mathematical formula}IMI(K)=0, which is not covered by the above theorem).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 12">
       Interestingly, the set {a mathematical formula}MI(K) is not only a Sperner family, but every Sperner family can be represented as {a mathematical formula}MI(K) of some knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K. Let {a mathematical formula}X={α1,…,αn} be any set and let {a mathematical formula}S be a Sperner family over X. Consider a propositional signature {a mathematical formula}At={a1,…,an} where each proposition {a mathematical formula}ai∈At corresponds to the element {a mathematical formula}αi∈X. Consider now a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}KnS={ϕ1,…,ϕn} defined via{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,n. Every {a mathematical formula}ϕi states that {a mathematical formula}ai is accepted and for each set M in {a mathematical formula}S which contains {a mathematical formula}αi at least one of the other elements must not be accepted. Thus, every {a mathematical formula}ϕi lists the conditions under which any set containing {a mathematical formula}αi does not contain an element of the Sperner family. Let {a mathematical formula}X={α,β,γ,δ} be a set and consider the Sperner family {a mathematical formula}S={S1,S2,S3} over X defined via{a mathematical formula} Consider now the signature {a mathematical formula}At={a,b,c,d} where the proposition a corresponds to α, b to β, c to γ, and d to δ. Then {a mathematical formula}K4S={ϕ1,ϕ2,ϕ3,ϕ4} is defined via{a mathematical formula} For example, {a mathematical formula}ϕ3 states that if some set S contains γ (c), either not β or not δ{a mathematical formula}(¬b∨¬d), and not α (¬a), then S does not contain any element of {a mathematical formula}S.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 13">
       By construction, it follows that {a mathematical formula}M={αk1,…,αkm} (for some {a mathematical formula}k1,…,km∈{1,…,n}) is an element of the Sperner family {a mathematical formula}S if and only if the set {a mathematical formula}{ϕk1,…,ϕkm} is a minimal inconsistent subset of {a mathematical formula}KnS={ϕ1,…,ϕn}. We continue Example 12 and consider {a mathematical formula}S1={β,γ,δ}∈S. The set {a mathematical formula}S1 corresponds to the set {a mathematical formula}{ϕ2,ϕ3,ϕ4}⊆K4S with{a mathematical formula} As one can see {a mathematical formula}{ϕ2,ϕ3,ϕ4} is also a minimal inconsistent subset of {a mathematical formula}K4S. Further, the set of minimal inconsistent subsets of {a mathematical formula}K4S is indeed{a mathematical formula} which is in direct correspondence to {a mathematical formula}S.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       From these observations it follows that {a mathematical formula}IMI(KnS)=|MI(KnS)|=|S|. Observe that if {a mathematical formula}S is a Sperner family over X and {a mathematical formula}S∈S then {a mathematical formula}S∖{S} is also a Sperner family over X (provided that it is non-empty). Then for a set X with {a mathematical formula}|X|=n and for every {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,(n⌊n/2⌋) we can define a Sperner family {a mathematical formula}Si over X with {a mathematical formula}|Si|=i. This means in our setting, for every {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,(n⌊n/2⌋) we can define a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K with {a mathematical formula}|K|=n such that {a mathematical formula}IMI(K)=i. Together with the fact that 0 is also a possible value of {a mathematical formula}IMI we obtain {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMI,n)=(n⌊n/2⌋)+1.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Furthermore, also the set of maximal consistent subsets {a mathematical formula}MC(K) of a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K form a Sperner family over {a mathematical formula}K, which is the reason why the value {a mathematical formula}Cf(Imc,n)=(n⌊n/2⌋) is almost the same as {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMI,n) (please see Appendix A for the detailed proof of {a mathematical formula}Cf(Imc,n)=(n⌊n/2⌋)).

       Monotone Boolean functions and minimal inconsistent sets
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Another interesting observation is the relation of the measures {a mathematical formula}IMIC and {a mathematical formula}IDf with the number {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n) of profiles of monotone Boolean functions of n variables [29]. Let us recall some basics on Boolean functions.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 23">
       A Boolean function f of n variables ({a mathematical formula}n∈N0) is a function {a mathematical formula}f:{0,1}n→{0,1}. Let {a mathematical formula}B(n) be the set of all Boolean functions of n variables. It can easily be seen that {a mathematical formula}|B(n)|=22n. A Boolean function f of n variables ({a mathematical formula}n∈N0) is monotone if for every {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,n we have{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula}MB(n) be the set of all monotone Boolean functions of n variables. Obviously {a mathematical formula}|MB(n)|≤|B(n)|. However, no closed form for {a mathematical formula}m(n)=|MB(n)|—which is also called Dedekind number{sup:6}[3]—is known and only values up to {a mathematical formula}n=8 could be determined yet, cf. [29]. The Dedekind number {a mathematical formula}m(n) has also a meaning in the context of Sperner families (see previous subsection). In fact, {a mathematical formula}m(n) is also the number of different Sperner families over a set X with {a mathematical formula}|X|=n.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 24">
       For the issue of analyzing inconsistency measures, the Dedekind number {a mathematical formula}m(n) itself is not directly applicable as it is somewhat syntax-sensitive. More precisely, consider the set {a mathematical formula}X={α,β,γ} and the two Sperner families {a mathematical formula}{{α,β}} and {a mathematical formula}{{β,γ}}. Each of these families count one in the Dedekind number {a mathematical formula}m(3). From the perspective of inconsistency measurement, the sets of minimal inconsistent subsets {a mathematical formula}MI(K1)={{α,β}} and {a mathematical formula}MI(K2)={{α,γ}} for some knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K1,K2∈Kf(3) are indistinguishable for all inconsistency measures solely based on utilizing minimal inconsistent sets. While for {a mathematical formula}IMI only the number of minimal inconsistent sets is important, even for more elaborate measures such as {a mathematical formula}IMIC and {a mathematical formula}IDf these sets are equivalent as they coincide in both the number of minimal inconsistent sets and the cardinalities of each of those. Recall that in order to define the measure {a mathematical formula}IDf we defined for a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K the sets{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,|K|. Given these values, we can also redefine the inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}IMIC via{a mathematical formula} Let us call {a mathematical formula}profile(K)=(|MI(1)(K)|,…,|MI(|K|)(K)|)∈N0|K| the {a mathematical formula}MI-profile of {a mathematical formula}K. One can see that {a mathematical formula}IMIC depends only on {a mathematical formula}profile(K) and not the actual structure of the minimal inconsistent subsets.{sup:7} However, this property of indifference has a corresponding property in the context of Boolean functions. Two Boolean functions {a mathematical formula}f1, {a mathematical formula}f2 of n variables ({a mathematical formula}n∈N0) are equivalent, denoted by {a mathematical formula}f1∼f2, if there is a permutation {a mathematical formula}σ:{1,…,n}→{1,…,n} such that{a mathematical formula} for all {a mathematical formula}x1,…,xn∈{0,1}. Let {a mathematical formula}MB(n)/∼ be the quotient set of {a mathematical formula}MB(n) wrt. ∼, i.e.{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}[f]∼ is the equivalence class (also called profile) of f, i.e., {a mathematical formula}[f]∼={f′∈MB(n)|f′∼f}. Then {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n) is defined as {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n)=|MB(n)/∼|, i.e., {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n) is the number of profiles of monotone Boolean functions of n variables. As for the Dedekind number {a mathematical formula}m(n), no closed form for {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n) is known [29].{sup:8} However, we can observe an intriguing relationship of this number to inconsistency measures via{a mathematical formula} In other words, the number of different {a mathematical formula}MI-profiles of knowledge bases of size n is the same as the number of profiles of monotone Boolean functions of n variables. In order to see this, recall that there is a one-to-one correspondence of {a mathematical formula}MI(K) with Sperner families. It has already been mentioned that there is also a relationship between Sperner families and monotone Boolean functions. More precisely, let {a mathematical formula}S be any Sperner family over {a mathematical formula}X={a1,…,an} and define a Boolean function {a mathematical formula}fS via{a mathematical formula} for all {a mathematical formula}x1,…,xn∈{0,1}. In other words, the function {a mathematical formula}fS(x1,…,xn) evaluates to 1 if there is a member {a mathematical formula}S∈S such that the corresponding variables of the elements of S are 1. Observe that {a mathematical formula}fS is monotone for every Sperner family {a mathematical formula}S. Moreover, it can also be seen that for every monotone Boolean function f there is a uniquely determined Sperner family {a mathematical formula}S such that {a mathematical formula}f=fS. Consider now two monotone Boolean functions {a mathematical formula}f1, {a mathematical formula}f2 with {a mathematical formula}f1∼f2. Then these correspond to two Sperner families {a mathematical formula}S1, {a mathematical formula}S2 over X, where {a mathematical formula}S2 can be obtained from {a mathematical formula}S1 by only permuting the elements of X. The only invariant between the Sperner families corresponding to the functions in {a mathematical formula}[f]∼ is the number of sets in each, and the sizes of each set. In the context of minimal inconsistent sets, this means that there is a one-to-one correspondence between any {a mathematical formula}MI-profile and an equivalence class {a mathematical formula}[f]∼, leading to Equation (1).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 14">
       For the specific case of {a mathematical formula}IMIC it has to be observed that the assignment of an {a mathematical formula}MI-profile to the inconsistency value is not injective, i.e., there may be more than one {a mathematical formula}MI-profile that is mapped to the same inconsistency value. Consider the knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K3,K4∈Kf(5) defined via{a mathematical formula} Here we have{a mathematical formula} and therefore{a mathematical formula} yielding {a mathematical formula}IMIC(K3)=IMIC(K4)=1/2.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       This behavior is the reason that {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n) is only an upper bound for {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMIC,n) in Theorem 1. As for {a mathematical formula}m(n) and {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n), no closed form for {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMIC,n) could be found in our investigation. Using a computational brute-force approach we could however determine the first five values for {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMIC,n) ({a mathematical formula}n=1,…,5) which are listed in Table 4 together with their corresponding upper bounds {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n). The measure {a mathematical formula}IMIC is quite simplistic in its way to aggregate an {a mathematical formula}MI-profile into a single inconsistency measure. A more elaborated measure is {a mathematical formula}IDf (see Definition 5) where this aggregation is more fine-grained. For this measure, we obtain {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMIC,n)≤Cf(IDf,n)≤Ψ(n), i.e., {a mathematical formula}IDf is more expressive than {a mathematical formula}IMIC but still bounded by {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n). Note again that Definition 5 represents only a single instance of a more general family of inconsistency measures presented by Mu et al. [25]. Using an injective function h from the set of {a mathematical formula}MI-profiles to real numbers one can instantiate this family with an instance {a mathematical formula}IDf′ where we could actually have {a mathematical formula}Cf(IDf′,n)=Ψ(n).{sup:9} In any case, {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n) is always an upper bound for every measure following the paradigm of {a mathematical formula}IDf.

       Knight's inconsistency measure and the Farey series
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Let us now turn to another interesting relationship, namely that of the inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}Iη[17] with the Farey series.{sup:10}{sup:,}{sup:11} The latter is defined as the series of numbers generated by the function {a mathematical formula}Φ:N→N defined via{a mathematical formula} for all {a mathematical formula}x∈N. In other words, {a mathematical formula}Φ(x) is the number of different fractional expressions in {a mathematical formula}[0,1] with maximal denominator x (where both nominator and denominator are natural numbers). For example, for {a mathematical formula}x=3 we have{a mathematical formula} yielding {a mathematical formula}Φ(3)=5. Let us now recall the measure {a mathematical formula}Iη which is defined as{a mathematical formula} for every {a mathematical formula}K∈K. So in order to determine {a mathematical formula}Iη(K) we are seeking a probability function {a mathematical formula}P∈P(At) that maximizes the minimum probability it assigns to formulas in {a mathematical formula}K. For the remainder of this section, let {a mathematical formula}PK be any probability function that maximizes the minimum probability of all formulas of {a mathematical formula}K, i.e., we have {a mathematical formula}Iη(K)=1−ξK with {a mathematical formula}ξK=min⁡{PK(α)|α∈K}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       A first observation one can make about {a mathematical formula}PK and {a mathematical formula}Iη—which also sets it apart from many other inconsistency measures—is that it does not care for the syntactic representation of formulas. More precisely, for any knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K, formulas ϕ, {a mathematical formula}ϕ′ with {a mathematical formula}ϕ≡ϕ′ we have {a mathematical formula}Iη(K∪{ϕ})=Iη(K∪{ϕ′}) as {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ)=P(ϕ′) for every probability function. Moreover, we also have {a mathematical formula}Iη(K∪{ϕ})=Iη(K∪{ϕ,ϕ′}) for the same reason; adding syntactic variations of already present formulas does not change the inconsistency value. It follows that we can identify every formula {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K with its set of models {a mathematical formula}Mod(ϕ) in all matters related to determining {a mathematical formula}Iη(K). By abusing notation we therefore can rewrite {a mathematical formula}K as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}P(X) is the power set of a set X and {a mathematical formula}At is the signature of the underlying propositional language. Assume that {a mathematical formula}At={a1,…,an}, then {a mathematical formula}Ω(At) has {a mathematical formula}2n elements and every {a mathematical formula}Mod(ϕ) is a subset of those.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Let us first consider the question of how {a mathematical formula}K′ and {a mathematical formula}K could look like if we want to have {a mathematical formula}ξK′=k/l for {a mathematical formula}l∈{1,…,2n} and {a mathematical formula}k∈{1,…,l}. Consider an arbitrary set {a mathematical formula}{ω1,…,ωl}⊆Ω(At) of interpretations (as {a mathematical formula}l≤2n there are enough different interpretations) and define {a mathematical formula}PK′(ω)=1/l for all {a mathematical formula}ω∈{ω1,…,ωl} and {a mathematical formula}PK′(ω′)=0 for all remaining {a mathematical formula}ω′. Then {a mathematical formula}PK′ is indeed a probability function that assigns equal probability to all {a mathematical formula}{ω1,…,ωl}. Then define a formula ϕ in such a way that {a mathematical formula}Mod(ϕ) is any k-element subset of {a mathematical formula}{ω1,…,ωl}. Then we obtain {a mathematical formula}PK(ϕ)=k/l. Populating {a mathematical formula}K with all ϕ that can be defined as such, we obtain a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K with {a mathematical formula}ξK=k/l.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 15">
       Consider the propositional signature {a mathematical formula}At3={a1,a2,a3}, i.e., we have {a mathematical formula}n=3 and {a mathematical formula}2n=8. Choose {a mathematical formula}ξK′=5/6 (note that {a mathematical formula}6∈{1,…,8} and {a mathematical formula}5∈{1,…,6}) and consider the following 6 interpretations {a mathematical formula}ω1,…,ω6∈Ω(At3):{a mathematical formula} The following sets {a mathematical formula}M1,…,M6 are all 5-element subsets of {a mathematical formula}ω1,…,ω6:{a mathematical formula} Consider formulas {a mathematical formula}ϕi with {a mathematical formula}Mod(ϕi)=Mi for {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,6. For example, we have {a mathematical formula}ϕ1=a1∨(a2∧a3). For the knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K={ϕ1,…,ϕ6} consider the probability function {a mathematical formula}PK with {a mathematical formula}PK(ω1)=…=PK(ω6)=1/6 and {a mathematical formula}P(ω)=0 for {a mathematical formula}ω∈Ω(At3)∖{ω1,…ω6}. By construction we have {a mathematical formula}PK(ϕ1)=…=PK(ϕ6)=5/6. Note also that there cannot be any other probability function that gives larger probability to all formulas.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       So given a signature {a mathematical formula}At={a1,…,an} and any {a mathematical formula}l∈{1,…,2n} and {a mathematical formula}k∈{1,…,l} we can construct a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K such that {a mathematical formula}ξK=k/l (and therefore {a mathematical formula}Iη(K)=1−k/l). This gives us {a mathematical formula}Cv(Iη,n)≥Φ(2n).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The remaining question is whether there are numbers {a mathematical formula}x∈[0,1] that are not of the form {a mathematical formula}x=k/l with {a mathematical formula}l∈{1,…,2n} and {a mathematical formula}k∈{1,…,l} and for which a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K can be found such that {a mathematical formula}ξK=x. Knight already showed in Knight [17] that {a mathematical formula}ξK must always be a rational number in the unit interval, so it is clear that {a mathematical formula}x=p/q for some {a mathematical formula}p,q∈N with {a mathematical formula}p≤q. So what about e.g. {a mathematical formula}x=1/(2n+1)? It can be shown (see the complete proof in Appendix A) that due to combinatorial reasons a value such as {a mathematical formula}1/(2n+1) cannot be attained for {a mathematical formula}ξK if the underlying signature has n elements. For example, the uniform probability function P with {a mathematical formula}P(ω)=1/2n already yields {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ)≥1/2n for every formula {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K as it has at least one model (note that if {a mathematical formula}K contains a contradictory formula we always have {a mathematical formula}ξK=0).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Although the expressivity of {a mathematical formula}Iη is characterized by {a mathematical formula}Φ(2n) it has to be noted that {a mathematical formula}Φ(2n) increases quite rapidly which makes {a mathematical formula}Iη a quite expressive inconsistency measure (see Section 5).

       Normal forms for knowledge bases
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Many proofs of statements in Theorem 1 (in particular those showing infinite characteristics) involve the construction of particular families of knowledge bases that exhibit extreme inconsistency values, such as for {a mathematical formula}Cf(IdalalΣ,n)=∞ (for {a mathematical formula}n&gt;1). Recall that {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ is defined by determining an interpretation {a mathematical formula}ω∈Ω(At) such that each formula {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K has minimal distance to ω (measured in the number of propositions that have to be flipped in ω order to obtain a model of ϕ). Then {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ is the sum of all these distances.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In the proof of {a mathematical formula}Cf(IdalalΣ,n)=∞ (for {a mathematical formula}n&gt;1) the following family of knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}Ki is used:{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}i∈N. Note that each {a mathematical formula}Ki1 consists of only two formulas but the number of mentioned propositions increases with increasing i. It can be seen that for every interpretation {a mathematical formula}ω∈Ω(At) the sum of its distances to both formulas amounts to exactly i, i.e., {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ(Ki1)=i and for {a mathematical formula}i→∞ we obtain {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ(Ki1)→∞ and thus {a mathematical formula}Cf(IdalalΣ,n)=∞.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Constructions such as the above can be used to characterize normal forms of knowledge bases for inconsistency measures. For example, the above family {a mathematical formula}Ki1 for {a mathematical formula}i∈N exhaustively describes the image of {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} Note that {a mathematical formula}K01=∅. Every other knowledge base can be transformed into one of these knowledge bases while retaining its inconsistency value. While this transformation, of course, does not maintain semantic equivalence (even in a paraconsistent context), it can be used for illustration purposes. In each {a mathematical formula}Ki1 the inconsistency is boiled down to its essential core as it is measured by {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ. Inspecting this normal form, instead of the original knowledge base where the inconsistency might be obfuscated, can lead to better understanding of the severity of the inconsistency. We leave a deeper investigation of this matter for future work.

      About the distinction between {a mathematical formula}{α,β} and {a mathematical formula}{α∧β}
      <paragraph>
       By studying Table 3 it can be observed that almost all inconsistency measures have trivial characteristic values, i.e., a value of ∞, wrt. {a mathematical formula}Cl and {a mathematical formula}Cp, and the characteristics {a mathematical formula}Cv and {a mathematical formula}Cf seem to be much better suited for assessing the expressivity. The reason for this is that for many inconsistency measures some conjunctions {a mathematical formula}α∧β can be replaced by two distinct formulas α and β without decreasing the inconsistency value, so large inconsistency values can be attained by either having few long formulas or many short formulas. As {a mathematical formula}Cl and {a mathematical formula}Cp only consider the formula-length as fixed (or the number of propositions per formula), arbitrary different inconsistency values can be attained by considering arbitrary large knowledge bases. The only exception, besides the drastic inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}Id, is the measure {a mathematical formula}Idalalmax. Recall that the measure {a mathematical formula}Idalalmax is defined as the maximal distance of an optimally chosen {a mathematical formula}ω∈Ω(At) to each formula of the knowledge base. If formulas are short, i.e., they each mention only few propositions, this distance is bounded, independently of the number of formulas in the knowledge base.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The important distinction between a set of formulas {a mathematical formula}{α,β} and the conjunction {a mathematical formula}α∧β has already been recognized within e.g. the fields of inconsistent-tolerant reasoning and belief revision [18], [4]. For example, in the context of contracting from a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K5={a,b} the inference a, the usually accepted result should be {a mathematical formula}K5−a={b}. However, contracting from a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K6={a∧b} the inference a would result in {a mathematical formula}K6−a=∅. More generally, a conjunction {a mathematical formula}α∧β establishes a relationship between the formulas α and β and stipulates that they have to appear together (if one does not appear then the other one should also not appear). For a more detailed discussion see [18], [4].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Our study on the characteristics {a mathematical formula}Cl and {a mathematical formula}Cp (for details see the proofs in Appendix A) shows that many inconsistency measures do not recognize this difference and, moreover, behave quite incoherently in the general case of adding either separate formulas or a conjunction of the formulas to a knowledge base. Consider the following three properties for inconsistency measures. Let {a mathematical formula}I be an inconsistency measure, {a mathematical formula}K∈K, and {a mathematical formula}ϕ,ψ∈L(At) be arbitrary. ∧-Indifference{a mathematical formula}I(K∪{α,β})=I(K∪{α∧β}).∧-Penalty{a mathematical formula}I(K∪{α,β})≤I(K∪{α∧β}).∧-Mitigation{a mathematical formula}I(K∪{α,β})≥I(K∪{α∧β}). Note that Besnard [2] proposed ∧-Indifference under the name Adjunction Invariancy as a desirable property. However, we do not aim to discuss which (if any) of these properties may be desirable.

       As a consequence, the inconsistency values for many measures change quite arbitrarily when a conjunction {a mathematical formula}α∧β is replaced by it conjuncts α and β. Consider the knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K7 given via{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} As one can see, the set {a mathematical formula}MI(K) may change quite differently when adding separate formulas or conjunctions to {a mathematical formula}K. In Equations (3) and (4) the addition of a conjunction leads to more minimal inconsistent sets than the addition of separate formulas. In Equations (5) and (6) it is exactly the other way around. It follows that for measures {a mathematical formula}I based on minimal inconsistent subsets—such as {a mathematical formula}IMI—there is no general relationship such as {a mathematical formula}I(K∪{α,β})≤I(K∪{α∧β}) or {a mathematical formula}I(K∪{α,β})≥I(K∪{α∧β}) for arbitrary knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K and formulas α and β.

      Expressivity orders
     </section-title>
     <paragraph label="Definition 25">
      Let us now come back to the original motivation of comparing inconsistency measures wrt. their expressivity. Definition 20 provides the basis for a comparative analysis of inconsistency measures wrt. their expressivity, which we address with the following definition. An inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}I is at least as expressive as an inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}I′ wrt. a characteristic {a mathematical formula}Cα ({a mathematical formula}α∈{f,v,l,p}), denoted by {a mathematical formula}I⪰αI′, if there is {a mathematical formula}n0∈N such that for all {a mathematical formula}n&gt;n0, {a mathematical formula}Cα(I,n)≥Cα(I′,n).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      If both {a mathematical formula}I⪰αI′ and {a mathematical formula}I′⪰αI, we say that {a mathematical formula}I and {a mathematical formula}I′ are equally expressive wrt. {a mathematical formula}Cα and denote this by {a mathematical formula}I∼αI′. If {a mathematical formula}I⪰αI′ but not {a mathematical formula}I∼αI′ we write {a mathematical formula}I≻αI′ ({a mathematical formula}I is strictly more expressive than {a mathematical formula}I′). Note that the expressivity order ⪰ is not to be confused with the refinement order ⊑ sometimes used for pairwise comparisons of inconsistency measures, see e.g. [31]. The refinement order ⊑ is defined as {a mathematical formula}I1⊑I2 iff {a mathematical formula}I2(K)≥I2(K′) implies {a mathematical formula}I1(K)≥I1(K′) for all {a mathematical formula}K, {a mathematical formula}K′. If {a mathematical formula}I1⊑I2 this means that {a mathematical formula}I2 is a refinement of {a mathematical formula}I1. Note that {a mathematical formula}⪰α compares measures in a quantitative way and also allows comparison of measures that induce totally different orders on knowledge bases. However, it is also easy to see that {a mathematical formula}I1⊑I2 implies {a mathematical formula}I2⪰αI1 (for all {a mathematical formula}α∈{f,v,l,p}).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Corollary 1">
      By exploiting the results from Theorem 1 we obtain the following simple corollary. The expressivity orders wrt. α-characteristics{a mathematical formula}Cα(I,n)({a mathematical formula}α∈{f,v,l,p}) for the inconsistency measures{a mathematical formula}Id,{a mathematical formula}IMI,{a mathematical formula}IMIC,{a mathematical formula}Iη,{a mathematical formula}Ic,{a mathematical formula}ILPm,{a mathematical formula}Imc,{a mathematical formula}Ip,{a mathematical formula}Ihs,{a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ,{a mathematical formula}Idalalmax,{a mathematical formula}Idalalhit,{a mathematical formula}IDf,{a mathematical formula}IPm,{a mathematical formula}Imv, and{a mathematical formula}Incare as shown inFig. 1.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The proof of the above corollary is omitted as the results follow directly from Theorem 1.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In Fig. 1 the order {a mathematical formula}≻f does not show the placement of the measures {a mathematical formula}IDf, {a mathematical formula}IMIC, and {a mathematical formula}Iη as we only provided upper bounds for the corresponding characteristics in Theorem 1. However, we can give the following partial classification.

     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The proof of the above corollary is straightforward as, e.g., we provided a finite bound for {a mathematical formula}Cf(Iη,n) (for every n) while {a mathematical formula}Cf(Ic,n) is unbounded. Empirical evidence suggests also the following relationships, but a formal proof has yet to be found.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Conjecture 1">
      {a mathematical formula}IDf≻fIMIC≻fIη≻fIMI.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Fig. 1 shows that the measures {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ and {a mathematical formula}IPm are the only measures that have maximal expressivity wrt. all four expressivity characteristics (among the considered inconsistency measures) and, as expected, the drastic inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}Id is the least expressive one. One can also observe that for many measures their positioning in the orders {a mathematical formula}≻v and {a mathematical formula}≻p is complementary, i.e., if a measure has high expressivity wrt. {a mathematical formula}Cf it has low expressivity wrt. {a mathematical formula}Cv (consider e.g. {a mathematical formula}Ic and {a mathematical formula}Ip). This is due to the fact that many measures measure only a specific aspect of inconsistency and usually belong either to the {a mathematical formula}MI-based family of inconsistency measures—which focus on using minimal inconsistent subsets for measuring—or the variable-based family—which focus on conflicting propositions—, cf. [12]. Therefore, they are constrained in their expressivity if one of these dimensions is limited. For example, if the number of formulas in a knowledge base is restricted, so is the number of minimal inconsistent subsets.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Again, it should be noted that expressivity characteristics are meant to complement the investigation of rationality postulates, not to replace them. Rationality postulates are important to analyze the meaningfulness of the values of inconsistency measures, while our characteristics provide a quantitative assessment of their expressivity. However, we believe that the concept of expressivity characteristics and the results reported in this work will nurture general comparative analyses of inconsistency measures.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Proposition 1">
      The expressivity characteristics considered in this paper each tackle one specific aspect of size of a knowledge base. Of course, one can also combine these characteristics to obtain hybrid versions via{a mathematical formula} with {a mathematical formula}α,α′∈{v,f,l,p}, {a mathematical formula}α≠α′, and {a mathematical formula}n,m&gt;0. For example, {a mathematical formula}Cv,f(I,n,m) is the number of different inconsistency values on knowledge bases which mention at most n propositions and consist of at most m formulas. A simple observation on these new characteristics is the following one. Let{a mathematical formula}α,α′∈{v,f,l,p},{a mathematical formula}α≠α′, and{a mathematical formula}n,m&gt;0. Then{a mathematical formula}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The proof of the above proposition is straightforward. An investigation of these hybrid and other characteristics—and the resulting expressivity orders—is left for future work.

      Summary and conclusion
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      We conducted a focused but extensive comparative analysis of 16 inconsistency measures from the recent literature in terms of their expressivity. For that, we introduced 4 different expressivity characteristics and conducted an analytical evaluation of the considered measures wrt. these expressivity characteristics. Our findings revealed some interesting relationships of inconsistency measures to, e.g., set theory and monotone Boolean functions. Finally, the measures {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ[8] and {a mathematical formula}IPm[16] have been proven to be maximally expressive wrt. all our characteristics.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Expressivity characteristics provide a novel evaluation method for assessing the quality of inconsistency measures. It has to be noted again, however, that high expressivity alone is not a sufficient criterion for doing this. It is straightforward to construct measures that exhibit maximal expressivity along all discussed dimensions, but fail to comply with the intuitions one expects from inconsistency measures. The use of rationality postulates—such as the ones presented and discussed in Hunter and Konieczny [11]; Mu et al. [25]; Besnard, [2]—must still serve as first-level evaluation criterion. If measures satisfy the same (or a similar set of) rationality postulates, expressivity can be used to make further quality assessments.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      To the best of our knowledge, our work is the most extensive comparative analysis of inconsistency measures so far. All inconsistency measures discussed in this paper have been implemented and an online interface to try out these measures is available.{sup:12}

According to Sperner's theorem the maximal cardinality (which is also attained) of any Sperner family of a set T with {a mathematical formula}|T|=n is {a mathematical formula}(n⌊n/2⌋)[28]. If {a mathematical formula}K is consistent we have {a mathematical formula}MI(K)=∅ and {a mathematical formula}IMI(K)=0, yielding {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMI,n)≤(n⌊n/2⌋)+1. To show {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMI,n)≥(n⌊n/2⌋)+1 we show that every Sperner family can be represented through {a mathematical formula}MI(K) of a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K. Let {a mathematical formula}T={α1,…,αn} be a set and define a propositional signature {a mathematical formula}At={a1,…,an}. Let S be any Sperner family of T with cardinality {a mathematical formula}(n⌊n/2⌋). Define a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}KnS={ϕ1,…,ϕn} via{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,n.

It follows that {a mathematical formula}IMI(KnS)=|MI(KnS)|=|S|=(n⌊n/2⌋). As removing any element from a Sperner family still yields a Sperner family, every value between 1 and {a mathematical formula}(n⌊n/2⌋) can be attained. Together with the fact that 0 is also a possible value of {a mathematical formula}IMI we obtain {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMI,n)≥(n⌊n/2⌋)+1 and thus {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMI,n)=(n⌊n/2⌋)+1.

It follows that{a mathematical formula} As discussed in 6, for every knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K the set {a mathematical formula}MI(K) is a Sperner family. It is well-known that there is an equivalence between Sperner families and monotone boolean functions, cf. [29]. In [29] the number of inequivalent monotone boolean functions has been investigated, see also http://oeis.org/A220880. These numbers are the same of inequivalent Sperner families as well. Here, two Sperner families {a mathematical formula}MI(K) and {a mathematical formula}MI(K′) are equivalent if they yield the same {a mathematical formula}MI-profiles. The number of different {a mathematical formula}MI-profiles is also the number on the right-hand side of the above equation, thus showing the claim {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMIC,n)≤Ψ(n) where {a mathematical formula}Ψ(n) is the number of inequivalent monotone Boolean functions on n variables.

       {a mathematical formula}Cv(Iη,n)=Φ(2n)We first show {a mathematical formula}Cv(Iη,n)≤Φ(2n). In [17] it has already been shown that {a mathematical formula}Iη(K)∈[0,1]∩Q for every {a mathematical formula}K (Definition 2.7 and Theorem 2.28). Hence, assume {a mathematical formula}η=k/l and {a mathematical formula}Iη(K)=1−η for {a mathematical formula}k,l∈N and {a mathematical formula}k≤l. We also assume for now that {a mathematical formula}K contains no contradictory formula. Furthermore, we assume that {a mathematical formula}K contains no free formulas (as {a mathematical formula}Iη satisfies independence they have no influence on the inconsistency value, cf. [30]). Let P be a probability function such that {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ)≥k/l for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K. It can be assumed that there is no {a mathematical formula}ω∈Ω(At) such that {a mathematical formula}P(ω)&gt;0 but {a mathematical formula}ω⊭ϕ for every {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K (otherwise one could set {a mathematical formula}P(ω)=0 and distribute the “probability mass” {a mathematical formula}P(ω) on the remaining interpretations which have already a positive probability; this cannot change the fact that {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ)≥k/l for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K). So for all {a mathematical formula}ω∈Ω(At), if {a mathematical formula}P(ω)&gt;0 then {a mathematical formula}ω⊨ϕ for some {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K. Define {a mathematical formula}FK(ω)={ϕ∈K|ω⊨ϕ} for all {a mathematical formula}ω∈Ω(At), i.e., {a mathematical formula}FK(ω) is the set of formulas in {a mathematical formula}K that are satisfied by ω. We can furthermore assume that for all {a mathematical formula}ω,ω′∈Ω(At) with {a mathematical formula}P(ω)&gt;0 and {a mathematical formula}P(ω′)&gt;0 we have {a mathematical formula}FK(ω)⊈FK(ω′) (otherwise we could set {a mathematical formula}P(ω)=0 and add the probability mass {a mathematical formula}P(ω) to {a mathematical formula}P(ω′), without decreasing the probabilities of the formulas). Assume furthermore, that among all probability functions that satisfy the above constraints, P is one such that {a mathematical formula}|{ω|P(ω)&gt;0}| is minimal.Now consider the case {a mathematical formula}|{ω|P(ω)&gt;0}|=2, i.e., there are two interpretations {a mathematical formula}ω1, {a mathematical formula}ω2 that receive positive probability. For every formula {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K, either {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈FK(ω1), or {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈FK(ω2), or {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈FK(ω1)∩FK(ω2). Note that the latter case cannot be possible for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K as otherwise {a mathematical formula}FK(ω1)=FK(ω2). Furthermore, there is one formula {a mathematical formula}ϕ′∈K with {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ′)=P(ω1) and one formula {a mathematical formula}ϕ″∈K with {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ″)=P(ω2), otherwise we would have {a mathematical formula}FK(ω1)⊆FK(ω2) or {a mathematical formula}FK(ω2)⊆FK(ω1). As {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ) has to be maximal for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K we can conclude {a mathematical formula}P(ω1)=P(ω2) and therefore {a mathematical formula}η=1/2.Now consider the case {a mathematical formula}|{ω|P(ω)&gt;0}|=3, i.e., there are three interpretations {a mathematical formula}ω1, {a mathematical formula}ω2, {a mathematical formula}ω3 that receive positive probability. For each {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K let {a mathematical formula}ΔP(ϕ)={ω∈Ω(At)|P(ω)&gt;0,ω⊨ϕ}, i.e., {a mathematical formula}ΔP(ϕ) is such that {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ)=∑ω∈ΔP(ϕ)P(ω). Note that it cannot be the case that {a mathematical formula}|ΔP(ϕ)|=3 for any {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K (otherwise ϕ would be free in {a mathematical formula}K) or that {a mathematical formula}|ΔP(ϕ)|=0 (then ϕ would be self-contradictory). Consider the following sub-cases:
       <list>
        for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K we have {a mathematical formula}|ΔP(ϕ)|=1:Then for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K we have {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ)=P(ω) for some {a mathematical formula}ω∈{ω1,ω2,ω3} and as there are no subset relations between any {a mathematical formula}FK(ω1), {a mathematical formula}FK(ω2), and {a mathematical formula}FK(ω3), it follows that {a mathematical formula}P(ω1)=P(ω2)=P(ω3)=1/3 maximizes each probability and we have {a mathematical formula}η=1/3.for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K we have {a mathematical formula}|ΔP(ϕ)|=2:Then for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K we have {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ)=P(ω)+P(ω′) for some {a mathematical formula}ω,ω′∈{ω1,ω2,ω3} with {a mathematical formula}ω≠ω′ and as there are no subset relations between any {a mathematical formula}FK(ω1), {a mathematical formula}FK(ω2), and {a mathematical formula}FK(ω3), it follows that {a mathematical formula}P(ω1)=P(ω2)=P(ω3)=1/3 maximizes each probability and we have {a mathematical formula}η=2/3.otherwise:Let {a mathematical formula}ϕ1∈K with {a mathematical formula}|ΔP(ϕ1)|=1. Without loss of generality assume {a mathematical formula}ΔP(ϕ1)={ω1}. As {a mathematical formula}FK(ω2)⊈FK(ω1) there is {a mathematical formula}ϕ2∈FK(ω2) with {a mathematical formula}ϕ2∉FK(ω1). Consider the case that for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈FK(ω3) either {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈FK(ω1) or {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈FK(ω2). Then {a mathematical formula}P′ defined via {a mathematical formula}P′(ω1)=0.5, {a mathematical formula}P′(ω2)=0.5, and {a mathematical formula}P′(ω)=0 for all other ω yields {a mathematical formula}P′(ϕ)≥0.5 for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K. Assuming P obtains a larger probability for all formulas implies that {a mathematical formula}P(ω)&gt;0.5 (in order to have {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ1)&gt;0.5), but then {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ2)&lt;0.5. So we have a contradiction since P is supposed to be minimal wrt. {a mathematical formula}|{ω|P(ω)&gt;0}|. It follows that there is {a mathematical formula}ϕ3∈FK(ω3) with {a mathematical formula}ϕ3∉FK(ω1) and {a mathematical formula}ϕ3∉FK(ω2), so {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ3)=P(ω3). Similarly, it can be assumed that {a mathematical formula}ϕ2∉FK(ω3) as well. As {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ1)=P(ω1), {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ2)=P(ω2), and {a mathematical formula}P(ϕ3)=P(ω3) it follows that {a mathematical formula}P(ω1)=P(ω2)=P(ω3)=1/3 maximizes each probability and we have {a mathematical formula}η=1/3.We now show that

       {a mathematical formula}Cf(Imc,n)=(n⌊n/2⌋)Note first, that if {a mathematical formula}K contains only self-contradictory formulas we have {a mathematical formula}MC(K)=∅. Otherwise, analogously to 6, observe that for every other consistent or inconsistent knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K the set {a mathematical formula}MC(K) is a Sperner family of {a mathematical formula}K, i.e. a set S of subsets from a set T for which {a mathematical formula}X⊆Y for no two {a mathematical formula}X,Y∈S. According to Sperner's theorem the maximal cardinality (which is also attained) of any Sperner family of a set T with {a mathematical formula}|T|=n is {a mathematical formula}(n⌊n/2⌋)[28]. Hence we have {a mathematical formula}0≤|MC(K)|≤(n⌊n/2⌋). Also analogously to 6 observe that every value can be attained by some knowledge base. For that let S be any Sperner family of cardinality {a mathematical formula}⌊n/2⌋ of a set {a mathematical formula}T={α1,…,αn}. Let {a mathematical formula}At={a1,…,an} and define a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}KˆnS={ϕ1,…,ϕn} with{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,n. Informally, every {a mathematical formula}ϕi lists all sets {a mathematical formula}M∈S that include {a mathematical formula}αi. Then a set {a mathematical formula}M⊆KˆnS is a maximal consistent subset if and only if it corresponds to an element of S. As removing any element from a Sperner family still yields a Sperner family, we have {a mathematical formula}{|MC(K)‖K∈Kf(n)}={i∈N|0≤i≤(n⌊n/2⌋)}.Note that for {a mathematical formula}|K|=n, {a mathematical formula}0≤|SC(K)|≤n (and every value can be attained). However, we cannot simply obtain the value {a mathematical formula}Cf(Imc,n) by adding the upper bounds of {a mathematical formula}|MC(K)| and {a mathematical formula}|SC(K)| as these two values are dependent. Observe that if {a mathematical formula}K with {a mathematical formula}|K|=n contains a self-contradictory formula ϕ then ϕ cannot be part of any maximal consistent subset of {a mathematical formula}K, i.e., we have {a mathematical formula}MC(K)=MC(K∖{ϕ}). In general, we have that if {a mathematical formula}K contains k contradictory formulas then {a mathematical formula}|MC(K)|≤((n−k)⌊(n−k)/2⌋). Define {a mathematical formula}cmcn,k=((n−k)⌊(n−k)/2⌋) and then we obtain the following characterization of {a mathematical formula}Cf(Imc,n):{a mathematical formula} That is, the value {a mathematical formula}Cf(Imc,n) is either {a mathematical formula}cmcn,0 (considering no self-contradictory formulas) or {a mathematical formula}cmcn,1+1 (considering one self-contradictory formula), etc. Observe that the first element of the above maximum is dominant for {a mathematical formula}n&gt;3. For {a mathematical formula}n=1 we obtain {a mathematical formula}Cf(Imc,n)=2 (a knowledge base with one formula is either consistent, i.e., {a mathematical formula}MC(K)={K}, {a mathematical formula}SC(K)=∅, and thus {a mathematical formula}Imc(K)=0; or it is inconsistent with {a mathematical formula}MC(K)={∅}, {a mathematical formula}SC(K)=K, and thus {a mathematical formula}Imc(K)=1). Note that either the empty set or the whole set are the only possible maximal consistent subsets. For {a mathematical formula}n=2 we obtain {a mathematical formula}Cf(Imc,n)=3: either {a mathematical formula}K is consistent ({a mathematical formula}Imc(K)=0), or it contains one self-contradictory formula ({a mathematical formula}Imc(K)=1), or it contains two contradictory formulas ({a mathematical formula}Imc(K)=2). Note that the maximal number of consistent subsets of {a mathematical formula}K is 2 (for the case that {a mathematical formula}K is a two-element minimal inconsistent set), but then there cannot be self-contradictory formulas and we have {a mathematical formula}Imc(K)=1. For {a mathematical formula}n=3 we obtain {a mathematical formula}Cf(Imc,n)=4 (for a consistent knowledge base and knowledge bases with 1 to 3 self-contradictory formulas and one maximal consistent subset). Note that the maximal number of consistent subsets of {a mathematical formula}K is 3, e.g. all two-element subsets, but then {a mathematical formula}K cannot contain any self-contradictory formula and we have {a mathematical formula}Imc(K)=2 which we can also obtain by having two self-contradictory formulas. For {a mathematical formula}n&gt;3 and {a mathematical formula}k=1,…,n we have{a mathematical formula} Note that {a mathematical formula}(n−1⌊n/2⌋)=(n−1⌊(n−1)/2⌋) as for odd n we have {a mathematical formula}(n−1⌊n/2⌋)=(n−1(n−1)/2)=(n−1⌊(n−1)/2⌋) and for even n we have {a mathematical formula}(n−1⌊n/2⌋)=(n−1n/2) which (as {a mathematical formula}n−1 is odd) is the same as {a mathematical formula}(n−1n/2−1)=(n−1⌊(n−1)/2⌋).
