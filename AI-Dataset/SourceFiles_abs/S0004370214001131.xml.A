      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      This paper deals with modularity in abstract argumentation. The “Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary” defines modular as “having parts that can be connected or combined in different ways” while the “Free Dictionary online” remarks that modularity is intended “for easy assembly and repair or flexible arrangement and use”. As such, modularity is a highly desirable property, often enforced by design, in any kind of either material (like the popular Lego toys) or immaterial (like programs developed according to the object-oriented paradigm) artifacts, including knowledge representation and reasoning formalisms.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Roughly speaking, modularity involves two main properties, namely separability and interchangeability of modules. As to the former, it has to be possible to describe and analyze the global behavior of an artifact in terms of the combination of the local behaviors of the modules composing it. Each local behavior can be characterized individually in a way which is independent of the internal details of the other modules (and, in a sense, of the module itself) and captures only the connections and mutual interactions between the module and the other ones. To put it in other words, each module can be described as a black-box whose Input/Output behavior fully determines its role in the global behavior of any artifact it is plugged in. As to the latter, the interest in replacing a module with another one is very common and arises from a large variety of motivations, either at the operational or design level. Interchangeability of two modules requires first of all that they are compatible as far as the connections with the rest of the artifact are concerned, i.e. that the interfaces they expose are such that wherever one of the modules can be “plugged in”, the other can too. Besides this plug-level interchangeability, it is of great interest to characterize the behavior-level interchangeability of modules, namely to identify the situations where internally different modules can be freely interchanged without affecting the global behavior of the artifact they belong to, since their Input/Output behavior is equivalent in this respect.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      While the formalism of abstract argumentation frameworks [25] and the relevant argumentation semantics (see [3] for a survey) do not appear to have been designed with modularity in mind, investigating their relevant properties is an important research topic which, after having been somehow overlooked, is attracting increasing attention in recent years. An argumentation framework is basically a directed graph representing the conflicts between a set of arguments (the nodes of the graph) and an argumentation semantics can be regarded as a method to answer (typically in a non-univocal way, i.e. producing a set of alternative answers) the “justification question”: “Which is the justification status of arguments given the conflict?”
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Referring to a representative set of semantics proposed in the literature, (namely admissible, complete, grounded, preferred, stable, semi-stable and ideal semantics) this paper provides a systematic and comprehensive assessment of modularity in abstract argumentation, by identifying and analyzing in this context the formal counterparts of the general notions of separability and interchangeability described above.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Given a partition of an argumentation framework into partial (or local) interacting subframeworks, analyzing separability consists in addressing the following issues:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="•">
       Is it possible to define a local counterpart of the notion of semantics? i.e. Is there a method to produce local answers to the justification question, taking into account the interactions with other subframeworks?
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="•">
       Can the set of justification answers prescribed by the (global) semantics be obtained by properly combining (in a bottom-up fashion) the sets of local answers produced in the subframeworks by its local counterpart?
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="•">
       symmetrically, Can the sets of local answers be obtained (in a top-down fashion) as projections onto the subframeworks of the global answers?
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      As to the first issue, we introduce the notion of local function for a subframework{sup:1} and show that under very mild requirements, satisfied by all semantics considered in this paper, it is possible (and easy) to identify the canonical local function for a global semantics. As to the second and third issues, we introduce the formal notions of top-down and bottom-up decomposability, which, jointly, correspond to the notion of (full) decomposability of an argumentation semantics.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Strong as it may seem, full decomposability with respect to every arbitrary partition of every argumentation framework is not unattainable. Indeed, we show that it is satisfied by some of the semantics considered in this paper, while some others are able to achieve at least top-down decomposability and the remaining ones lack all decomposability properties.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      As arbitrary partitions correspond to a completely free (if not anarchical) notion of modularity, we also consider a “tidier” style of partitioning, involving the graph-theoretical notion of strongly connected components. It turns out that, restricting the set of partitions this way, helps some, but not all, semantics to recover full decomposability.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Turning to interchangeability, we deal with both its plug-level and behavior-level aspects. As to the plug-level, borrowing some terminology from circuit theory, we introduce the notion of argumentation multipole as a generic replaceable argumentation component, namely a partial framework interacting through an input and output relation with an external set of invariant arguments.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Plug-level compatibility of two multipoles is a very relaxed notion, since it is only required that two multipoles refer to the same set of external arguments. This is motivated by the fact that imposing a tighter correspondence between Input/Output “terminals” of the multipoles would unnecessarily restrict the scope of the subsequent analysis on behavior-level compatibility. In fact, our analysis shows that a sensible notion of behavioral equivalence between multipoles (called Input/Output equivalence) can be introduced by requiring that the effect of the multipoles on the external arguments is the same: it may well be the case that multipoles with different “terminals” have the same effect in behavioral terms. Of course, Input/Output equivalence is a semantics-dependent notion since the behavior of a multipole can only be defined by referring to a specific semantics using the notion of local function mentioned above. In particular, it may be the case that two multipoles are equivalent with respect to some semantics and not equivalent with respect to another semantics.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Input/Output equivalence is the basis for the analysis of the operation of replacement within an argumentation framework. Basically, a replacement consists in substituting a part of the framework with a plug-level compatible multipole. While this notion per se allows for arbitrary substitutions, one is interested in analyzing those replacements which have a sound basis. In this perspective, building on multipole equivalence, it is possible to identify the semantics-dependent notions of legitimate and contextually legitimate replacement. Briefly, a replacement is legitimate if it involves “fully” equivalent multipoles, while it is contextually legitimate if it involves multipoles which are equivalent in the context where the replacement takes place, while not necessarily being equivalent in other contexts. Cleary, legitimate replacements are a (typically strict) subset of contextually legitimate replacements.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      One might expect that, given a semantics, legitimate (with respect to that semantics) replacements ensure that the invariant part of the framework is unaffected (in a sense, that it does not notice the change). This property is called semantics transparency. A stronger expectation (since the requirement on the replacements is weaker) would be that the invariant part of the framework is unaffected for any contextually legitimate replacement: this property is called strong transparency.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Natural as it may seem, transparency is not achieved by all semantics and requires a detailed analysis, showing that different levels of transparency are achieved by the semantics considered in this paper, also taking into account different restrictions on the set of allowed replacements.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      These results provide a reference context and fundamental answers to modularity-related issues in abstract argumentation, which, up to now, have been considered in the literature focusing on specific aspects and hence obtaining partial and problem-specific results. Moreover, while being theoretical by nature, the achievements of this paper have several significant application-oriented implications.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      On the one hand, semantics decomposability properties provide a sound basis for exploiting various forms of incremental computation which may deliver important efficiency gains in two main respects. First, they enable (and characterize the limits of) the application of divide-and-conquer strategies in the design of algorithms for computational problems in abstract argumentation frameworks. As most of these problems are intractable in the worst case, facing reduced-size subproblems separately and then combining the partial results in an efficient manner may significantly improve performances on the average. Second, there is a significant application interest in argumentation dynamics, which captures all contexts where a given framework is updated incrementally, as a consequence of the acquisition of new information and/or of the actions of the participants to a multi-agent system. Clearly, if the modification to the initial framework is limited, one is interested to partially reuse the results of previous computations in the new framework rather than redoing all computations from scratch. Again, decomposability properties enable (and characterize the limits of) the use of incremental computation techniques based on the separation between modified and unmodified parts in the updated framework.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      On the other hand, the notions and properties concerning multipole equivalence and semantics transparency are applicable in all contexts where there is an interest in replacing a part of a framework with another one. As an example, the activities of summarization and explanation involved in reasoning and communicating at different levels of granularity are, basically, alternative forms of replacement. In the former, a complex part of an argumentation process (e.g. the analysis and discussion of factual evidences in a legal case) is summarized (i.e. replaced) by a more synthetic representation (e.g. focusing on the facts which turn out to have an actual impact on the case decision) which, while leaving out unnecessary details, must ensure that the global outcome is preserved. Dually, explanation can be regarded as the replacement of a synthetic representation with a more detailed/articulated one, again ensuring that this does not induce undesired side-effects outside the replaced part. Further, and more specific of the abstract argumentation field, the basic formalism of argumentation frameworks is often used as a “ground level” representation for other richer and/or more specific formalisms. For instance, formalisms involving the explicit representation of preferences, values, and attacks to attacks can be translated (or flattened) to the basic formalism through suitable procedures. As these procedures typically consist of a set of local replacement rules, multipole equivalence and semantics transparency are very effective tools to analyze their behavior, soundness and applicability under various semantics.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The paper is organized as follows. After recalling the necessary background in Section 2, the general notions concerning semantics decomposability are introduced and discussed in Section 3, while Section 4 provides decomposability results for the seven semantics considered in this paper. Section 5 deals with the key technical notion of effect-dictated semantics and Section 6 then introduces the fundamental concepts concerning interchangeability, namely argumentation multipoles, their Input/Output equivalence, the replacement operator and the properties of semantics transparency. Section 7 analyzes the relationships between decomposability and transparency at a general level, while Section 8 provides transparency results for the seven semantics considered in this paper. Application examples are given in Section 9, Section 10 discusses related works and, finally, Section 11 concludes the paper. All proofs are given in Appendix A.

      Background
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      We follow the traditional definition of argumentation framework introduced by Dung [25] and define its restriction to a subset of arguments.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 1">
      An argumentation framework is a pair {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) in which Ar is a finite set of arguments and {a mathematical formula}att⊆Ar×Ar. An argument A such that there is no B such that {a mathematical formula}(B,A)∈att is called initial. An argument B such that {a mathematical formula}(B,B)∈att is called self-attacking. Given a set {a mathematical formula}Args⊆Ar, the restriction of AF to Args, denoted as {a mathematical formula}AF↓Args is the argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}(Args,att∩(Args×Args)).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In this paper we use the labelling-based approach to the definition of argumentation semantics. As shown in [21], [3], for the semantics considered in this paper there is a direct correspondence with the “traditional” extension-based approach, hence the results presented in this paper are valid in both approaches. The labelling-based definitions have been adopted only because they allow simpler proofs.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      A labelling assigns to each argument of an argumentation framework a label taken from a predefined set Λ. For technical reasons, we define labellings both for argumentation frameworks and for arbitrary sets of arguments.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 2">
      Let Λ be a set of labels. Given a set of arguments Args, a labelling of Args is a total function {a mathematical formula}Lab:Args⟶Λ. The set of all labellings of Args is denoted as {a mathematical formula}LArgs. Given an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), a labelling of AF is a labelling of Ar. The set of all labellings of AF is denoted as {a mathematical formula}L(AF). For a labelling Lab of Args, the restriction of Lab to a set of arguments {a mathematical formula}Args′⊆Args, denoted as {a mathematical formula}Lab↓Args′, is defined as {a mathematical formula}Lab∩(Args′×Λ).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We adopt the most common choice for Λ, i.e. {a mathematical formula}{in,out,undec}, where the label in means that the argument is accepted, the label out means that the argument is rejected, and the label undec means that the status of the argument is undecided. As explained after Definition 8, an exception is made for stable semantics, which can be more conveniently defined assuming {a mathematical formula}Λ={in,out}. Given a labelling Lab, we write {a mathematical formula}in(Lab) for {a mathematical formula}{A|Lab(A)=in}, {a mathematical formula}out(Lab) for {a mathematical formula}{A|Lab(A)=out} and {a mathematical formula}undec(Lab) for {a mathematical formula}{A|Lab(A)=undec}.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      A labelling-based semantics prescribes a set of labellings for each argumentation framework.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 3">
      Given an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), a labelling-based semantics S associates with AF a subset of {a mathematical formula}L(AF), denoted as {a mathematical formula}LS(AF).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In general, a semantics encompasses a set of alternative labellings for a single argumentation framework. However, a semantics may be defined so that a unique labelling is always prescribed, i.e. for every argumentation framework AF, {a mathematical formula}|LS(AF)|=1. In this case the semantics is said to be single-status, while in the general case it is said to be multiple-status.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In the labelling-based approach, a semantics definition relies on some legality constraints relating the label of an argument to those of its attackers.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 4">
      Let Lab be a labelling of the argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}(Ar,att). An in-labelled argument is said to be legallyin iff all its attackers are labelled out. An out-labelled argument is said to be legallyout iff it has at least one attacker that is labelled in. An undec-labelled argument is said to be legallyundec iff not all its attackers are labelled out and it does not have an attacker that is labelled in.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We now introduce the definitions of labellings corresponding to traditional admissible{sup:2} and complete semantics.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 5">
      Let {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) be an argumentation framework. An admissible labelling is a labelling Lab where every in-labelled argument is legally in and every out-labelled argument is legally out.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 6">
      A complete labelling is a labelling where every in-labelled argument is legally in, every out-labelled argument is legally out and every undec-labelled argument is legally undec.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      On this basis, the labelling-based definitions of several argumentation semantics can be introduced. To simplify the technical treatment in the following, grounded and preferred semantics are defined by referring to the commitment relation between labellings [3].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 7">
      Let {a mathematical formula}Lab1 and {a mathematical formula}Lab2 be two labellings. We say that {a mathematical formula}Lab2 is more or equally committed than {a mathematical formula}Lab1 ({a mathematical formula}Lab1⊑Lab2) iff {a mathematical formula}in(Lab1)⊆in(Lab2) and {a mathematical formula}out(Lab1)⊆out(Lab2).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 8">
      Let {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) be an argumentation framework. A stable labelling of AF is a complete labelling without undec-labelled arguments. The grounded labelling of AF is the minimal (w.r.t. ⊑) labelling among all complete labellings. A preferred labelling of AF is a maximal (w.r.t. ⊑) labelling among all complete labellings. The ideal labelling of AF is the maximal (under ⊑) complete{sup:3} labelling Lab that is less or equally committed than each preferred labelling of AF (i.e. for each preferred labelling {a mathematical formula}LabP it holds that {a mathematical formula}Lab⊑LabP). A semi-stable labelling of AF is a complete labelling Lab where {a mathematical formula}undec(Lab) is minimal (w.r.t. set inclusion) among all complete labellings.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      While stable semantics is defined by assuming {a mathematical formula}Λ={in,out,undec}, the definition of stable labelling entails that stable semantics can be equivalently defined with reference to the set of labels {a mathematical formula}Λ={in,out}. In this case, a stable labelling is simply a complete labelling, since the codomain Λ does not include undec. In the sequel we implicitly assume that, for stable semantics only, {a mathematical formula}Λ={in,out}: this allows a simpler treatment of such semantics without any loss of generality.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The uniqueness of the grounded and the ideal labelling has been proved in [22]. Accordingly, grounded and ideal semantics are single-status, the other semantics are multiple-status. Admissible, complete, stable, grounded, preferred, ideal and semi-stable semantics are denoted in the following as AD, CO, ST, GR, PR, ID and SST, respectively.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We also recall the traditional notions of skeptical and credulous justification of an argument with respect to a semantics.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 9">
      Given a labelling-based semantics S and an argumentation framework AF, an argument A is skeptically justified under S if {a mathematical formula}∀Lab∈LS(AF)Lab(A)=in; an argument A is credulously justified under S if {a mathematical formula}∃Lab∈LS(AF):Lab(A)=in.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Finally, a comment is in order on a special case of argumentation framework that is explicitly considered in the paper, i.e. the empty argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF∅≜(∅,∅). By definition the only possible labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF∅ is the empty set, thus a semantics can either prescribe ∅ for {a mathematical formula}AF∅ or it can prescribe no labelling at all. In this respect, for any semantics S introduced above it holds {a mathematical formula}LS(AF∅)={∅}, i.e. the empty set is actually prescribed by S. Note in particular that ∅ is a stable labelling, since it is complete and does not include undec-labelled arguments.

       The notion of local function
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The first step to define the notion of semantics decomposability is to introduce a formal setting to express the interactions between the partial frameworks induced by an arbitrary partitioning of an argumentation framework. Intuitively, given an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) and a subset Args of its arguments, the elements affecting {a mathematical formula}AF↓Args include the arguments attacking Args from the outside, called input arguments, and the attack relation from the input arguments to Args, called conditioning relation.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 10">
       Given {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) and a set {a mathematical formula}Args⊆Ar, the input of Args, denoted as {a mathematical formula}Argsinp, is the set {a mathematical formula}{B∈Ar∖Args|∃A∈Args,(B,A)∈att}, the conditioning relation of Args, denoted as {a mathematical formula}ArgsR, is defined as {a mathematical formula}att∩(Argsinp×Args).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 1">
       Consider {a mathematical formula}AF=({A,B,C,D},{(A,B),(B,C),(C,A),(A,D),(D,A)}) with reference to the partial frameworks induced by the sets {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C} and {a mathematical formula}{D} (see Fig. 1). It holds that {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C}inp={D} and {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C}R={(D,A)}, while {a mathematical formula}{D}inp={A} and {a mathematical formula}{D}R={(A,D)}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Given a partial argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF↓Args (possibly AF itself) affected by a (possibly empty) set of arguments {a mathematical formula}Argsinp attacking Args according to {a mathematical formula}ArgsR, one may wonder whether fixing the labelling assigned to the input arguments allows one to determine the set of labellings of {a mathematical formula}AF↓Args. As shown in the following, this question cannot be answered once and for all, since different semantics exhibit different behaviors in this respect, and, for some semantics, a dependency holds under specific constraints on the considered partition of the argumentation framework. In order to express such a dependency (whenever it holds), we introduce the notions of argumentation framework with input, consisting of an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) (playing the role of a partial argumentation framework), a set of external input arguments {a mathematical formula}I, a labelling {a mathematical formula}LI assigned to them and an attack relation {a mathematical formula}RI from {a mathematical formula}I to Ar, and of a local function which, given an argumentation framework with input, returns a corresponding set of labellings of AF.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 11">
       An argumentation framework with input is a tuple {a mathematical formula}(AF,I,LI,RI), including an argumentation framework{sup:4}{a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), a set of arguments {a mathematical formula}I such that {a mathematical formula}I∩Ar=∅, a labelling {a mathematical formula}LI∈LI and a relation {a mathematical formula}RI⊆I×Ar. A local function assigns to any argumentation framework with input a (possibly empty) set of labellings of AF, i.e. {a mathematical formula}F(AF,I,LI,RI)∈2L(AF).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For any semantics, a “sensible” local function, called canonical local function, is the one that describes the labellings of the so-called standard argumentation frameworks.

      <paragraph label="Definition 12">
       Given an argumentation framework with input {a mathematical formula}(AF,I,LI,RI), the standard argumentation framework w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}(AF,I,LI,RI) is defined as {a mathematical formula}AF′=(Ar∪I′,att∪R′I), where {a mathematical formula}I′=I∪{A′|A∈out(LI)} and {a mathematical formula}R′I=RI∪{(A′,A)|A∈out(LI)}∪{(A,A)|A∈undec(LI)}. Roughly, the standard argumentation framework puts AF under the influence of {a mathematical formula}(I,LI,RI), by adding {a mathematical formula}I to Ar and {a mathematical formula}RI to att, and by enforcing{sup:5} the label {a mathematical formula}LI for the arguments of {a mathematical formula}I in this way:

       Given a semantics S, the canonical local function of S (also called local function of S) is defined as {a mathematical formula}FS(AF,I,LI,RI)={Lab↓Ar|Lab∈LS(AF′)}, where {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) and {a mathematical formula}AF′ is the standard argumentation framework w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}(AF,I,LI,RI).

       Moreover, when applied to the empty argumentation framework (which by definition does not receive attacks from {a mathematical formula}I) the canonical local function of a complete-compatible semantics always returns the empty set as a unique labelling.

For the canonical local function of complete semantics it holds that {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF↓{A,B,C},{D},{(D,out)},{(D,A)})={{(A,undec),(B,undec),(C,undec)}}, due to the fact that the standard argumentation framework w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}(AF↓{A,B,C},{D},{(D,out)},{(D,A)}), shown in Fig. 2, admits as the unique complete labelling {a mathematical formula}{(D′,in),(D,out),(A,undec),(B,undec),(C,undec)}. In a similar way, it is easy to show that {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF↓{A,B,C},{D},{(D,in)},{(D,A)})={{(A,out),(B,in),(C,out)}} and {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF↓{A,B,C},{D},{(D,undec)},{(D,A)})={{(A,undec),(B,undec),(C,undec)}}.

       Decomposability properties of argumentation semantics
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       We now aim at introducing a formal notion of semantics decomposability. To this purpose, consider a generic argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) and an arbitrary partition of Ar, i.e. a set {a mathematical formula}{P1,…,Pn} such that {a mathematical formula}∀i∈{1,…,n}{a mathematical formula}Pi⊆Ar and {a mathematical formula}Pi≠∅, {a mathematical formula}⋃i=1…nPi=Ar and {a mathematical formula}Pi∩Pj=∅ for {a mathematical formula}i≠j. Such a partition identifies the restricted argumentation frameworks {a mathematical formula}AF↓P1,…,AF↓Pn, that affect each other with the relevant input arguments and conditioning relations as stated in Definition 10. Intuitively a semantics S is decomposable if S can be put in correspondence with a local function F such that:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="•">
        every labelling prescribed by S on AF, namely every element of {a mathematical formula}LS(AF), corresponds to the union of n “compatible” labellings {a mathematical formula}LP1,…,LPn of the restricted argumentation frameworks, all of them obtained applying F;
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="•">
        in turn, each union of n “compatible” labellings {a mathematical formula}LP1,…,LPn obtained applying F to the restricted frameworks gives rise to a labelling of AF.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       The “compatibility” constraint mentioned above reflects the fact that any labelling of a restricted framework is used by F for computing the other ones: {a mathematical formula}LPi plays a role in determining {a mathematical formula}LP1,…,LPi−1,LPi+1,…,LPn and vice versa. This means that {a mathematical formula}LP1,…,LPn are “compatible” if each {a mathematical formula}LPi is produced by F for {a mathematical formula}AF↓Pi with the input arguments {a mathematical formula}Piinp labelled according to {a mathematical formula}LP1,…,LPi−1,LPi+1,…,LPn. Definition 15 synthesizes all these considerations.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 15">
       A semantics S is fully decomposable (or simply decomposable) iff there is a local function F such that for every argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) and every partition {a mathematical formula}P={P1,…,Pn} of Ar, {a mathematical formula}LS(AF)=U(P,AF,F) where {a mathematical formula}U(P,AF,F)≜{LP1∪…∪LPn|LPi∈F(AF↓Pi,Piinp,(⋃j=1…n,j≠iLPj)↓Piinp,PiR)}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 3">
       Considering again the argumentation framework AF of Fig. 1 and the partition {a mathematical formula}{{A,B,C},{D}}, full decomposability of complete semantics requires a local function such that the labellings of AF are exactly those obtained by the union of the compatible labellings of {a mathematical formula}AF↓{A,B,C} and {a mathematical formula}AF↓{D} given by the local function itself. Let us consider the canonical local function{sup:6} of CO (refer to Example 2). The labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A,out),(B,in),(C,out)} is compatible with {a mathematical formula}{(D,in)}, since the first is obtained by {a mathematical formula}FCO with D labelled in, and the latter is obtained by {a mathematical formula}FCO with A labelled out. On the other hand, the labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A,out),(B,in),(C,out)} is not compatible e.g. with {a mathematical formula}{(D,out)}. Overall, exactly two global labellings arise from the combinations of the compatible outcomes of {a mathematical formula}FCO, namely {a mathematical formula}{(A,undec),(B,undec),(C,undec),(D,undec)} and {a mathematical formula}{(A,out),(B,in),(C,out),(D,in)}, corresponding to the complete labellings of AF.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The behavior of complete semantics in this example is not incidental: we will prove in Section 4 that complete semantics is fully decomposable.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Proposition 5 shows that, if a complete-compatible semantics S is fully decomposable, then the local function appearing in Definition 15 coincides with the canonical local function {a mathematical formula}FS.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 5">
       Given a complete-compatible semanticsS, ifSis fully decomposable then there is a unique local function satisfying the conditions ofDefinition 15, coinciding with the canonical local function{a mathematical formula}FS.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Full decomposability can be viewed as the conjunction of two partial decomposability properties, namely top-down decomposability and bottom-up decomposability.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In words, a semantics is top-down decomposable if the procedure to compute the global labellings identified by Definition 15 is complete, i.e. all of the global labellings can be obtained by combining the labellings prescribed by {a mathematical formula}FS for the restricted subframeworks, even if putting together labellings of the restricted subframeworks may give rise to some “spurious” labellings besides the correct ones. The following definition formalizes this intuition.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 16">
       A complete-compatible semantics S is top-down decomposable iff for any argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) and any partition {a mathematical formula}P={P1,…,Pn} of Ar, it holds that {a mathematical formula}LS(AF)⊆U(P,AF,FS).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 17">
       While top-down decomposability corresponds to completeness of the procedure identified by Definition 15, bottom-up decomposability requires its soundness, i.e. that any combination of local labellings is a global labelling, while it is not guaranteed that all global labellings can be obtained in this way. A complete-compatible semantics S is bottom-up decomposable iff for any argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) and any partition {a mathematical formula}P={P1,…,Pn} of Ar, it holds that {a mathematical formula}LS(AF)⊇U(P,AF,FS).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       A comment on the two definitions above is in order. While the definition of full decomposability applies to any kind of semantics and requires the existence of a local function satisfying the decomposability property, Definition 16, Definition 17 are restricted to complete-compatible semantics and refer to the canonical local function {a mathematical formula}FS to avoid triviality: the local function returning all the possible labellings of AF trivially satisfies the inclusion condition of Definition 16 for any semantics, while the local function always returning the empty set trivially satisfies the condition of Definition 17. This is the reason why both definitions refer to the specific canonical local function, which makes sense for complete-compatible semantics in the light of Proposition 5. If a semantics is not complete-compatible{sup:7} then the notion of canonical local function is meaningless, since the labelling {a mathematical formula}LI would not be in general enforced for the arguments of {a mathematical formula}I in the standard argumentation framework w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}(AF,I,LI,RI) (see Proposition 2).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       As shown in Section 4, some semantics that do not satisfy full decomposability are still able to satisfy top-down decomposability. Moreover, there are semantics that do not satisfy either of them: in this case it is interesting to investigate whether decomposability holds by restricting the possible partitions of the argumentation frameworks to those satisfying a given set of constraints. To express this restriction, we first introduce the notion of partition selector.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 18">
       A partition selector{a mathematical formula}F is a function receiving as input an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) and returning a set of partitions of Ar. A partition selector is defined as a function of argumentation frameworks, since different argumentation frameworks with the same set of arguments may allow different sets of partitions, depending on the attack relation.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The decomposability notions introduced so far can then be extended to take into account a specific restriction on the considered partitions.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 19">
       Let {a mathematical formula}F be a partition selector. A complete-compatible semantics S is top-down decomposable w.r.t.{a mathematical formula}F iff for any argumentation framework AF and any partition {a mathematical formula}P={P1,…,Pn}∈F(AF), it holds that {a mathematical formula}LS(AF)⊆U(P,AF,FS). A complete-compatible semantics S is bottom-up decomposable w.r.t.{a mathematical formula}F iff for any argumentation framework AF and any partition {a mathematical formula}{P1,…,Pn}∈F(AF), {a mathematical formula}LS(AF)⊇U(P,AF,FS). A complete-compatible semantics is fully decomposable (or simply decomposable) w.r.t. a partition selector{a mathematical formula}F iff it is both top-down and bottom-up decomposable w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}F.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Of course, full decomposability, top-down decomposability and bottom-up decomposability as introduced in Definition 15, Definition 16, Definition 17, respectively, are equivalent to the corresponding decomposability properties w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}FALL, i.e. the selector returning all possible partitions.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 20">
       For any argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), {a mathematical formula}FALL(AF)≜{{P1,…,Pn}|{P1,…,Pn} is a partition of Ar}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Apart from this limit case, a particular partition selector that has received attention in the literature and will be considered in this paper is the one based on the notion of strongly connected component (SCC) of an argumentation framework. Its importance is due to the fact that most argumentation semantics in the literature are SCC-recursive[10], which, briefly, means that the semantics can be defined in terms of a base function operating at the level of single strongly connected components. Roughly, this also implies that an incremental computation procedure based on the decomposition of the framework into its strongly connected components can be defined, a property exploited in several subsequent works [33], [40], [23]. Here we introduce the necessary basic definitions, leaving further discussion on this subject to Section 10.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 21">
       Given an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), the set of strongly connected components of AF, denoted as {a mathematical formula}SCCSAF, consists of the equivalence classes of arguments induced by the binary relation of path-equivalence, i.e. the relation {a mathematical formula}ρ(A,B) defined over {a mathematical formula}Ar×Ar such that {a mathematical formula}ρ(A,B) holds if and only if {a mathematical formula}A=B or there are directed paths from A to B and from B to A in AF.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For instance, the argumentation framework of Fig. 1 has a unique strongly connected component including all of the arguments, while for the argumentation framework AF of Fig. 2 it holds that {a mathematical formula}SCCSAF={{D′},{D},{A,B,C}}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       At least two partition selectors based on strongly connected components can be considered. The simplest selector, denoted as {a mathematical formula}FSCC, includes for each argumentation framework AF the unique partition consisting of the strongly connected components {a mathematical formula}SCCSAF. A second selector, denoted as {a mathematical formula}F∪SCC, includes all the partitions such that every element is the union of some (possibly unconnected) strongly connected components.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 22">
       For any argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), {a mathematical formula}FSCC(AF)≜{SCCSAF}∖{∅}, {a mathematical formula}F∪SCC(AF)≜{{P1,…,Pn}|{P1,…,Pn} is a partition of Ar and ∀i((S∈SCCSAF∧Pi∩S≠∅)→S⊆Pi}).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It is immediate to see that, for any AF, {a mathematical formula}FSCC(AF)⊆F∪SCC(AF). As to the first part of the definition, note that the set {a mathematical formula}SCCSAF includes ∅ only in case {a mathematical formula}AF=AF∅, which does not admit any partition (since all the elements of a partition must be nonempty), thus {a mathematical formula}FSCC(AF∅)=∅.

A synthetic view of the results is given in Table 1 (note that for all semantics full, top-down and bottom-up decomposability w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}F∪SCC turn out to be satisfied if and only if full, top-down and bottom-up decomposability w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}FSCC are satisfied, respectively).

       Admissible and complete semantics

      <paragraph>
       We first analyze admissible and complete semantics, since they are the basis for the other ones considered in this paper: according to Definition 8, stable, grounded, preferred, ideal, and semi-stable semantics select labellings among the complete ones, which are admissible by definition. Given this, it would be very unpleasant if complete (and thus admissible) semantics would not be decomposable. As shown by Theorem 1, Theorem 3, luckily both admissible and complete semantics turn out to be fully decomposable.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The following definition introduces the canonical local function of admissible semantics, by extending the definition of admissible labelling in order to account for “external” input arguments in the obvious way. The proof that the definition is correct is provided by Theorem 2.

       Stable semantics inherits full decomposability from complete semantics: the reason is that the definition of stable labelling corresponds to that of complete labelling with the additional requirement that no argument is labelled undec, and this requirement holds at the level of the whole argumentation framework iff it holds in any of its subframeworks.

       As in the previous cases, the canonical local functions of grounded and preferred semantics can be obtained by extending the definition of grounded and preferred labelling, respectively. Proposition 6 identifies these functions, also showing that the relevant definitions are well-founded, in particular, that there is always a unique minimal labelling in {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI) and that {a mathematical formula}FPR(AF,I,LI,RI) is nonempty.

      <paragraph>
       Differently from stable semantics, grounded semantics and preferred semantics do not inherit decomposability from complete semantics. The reason is that the definition of grounded/preferred labelling includes a minimization/maximization requirement, and satisfying this requirement in all of the subframeworks does not entail satisfying it at the level of the whole framework. To show this, consider the following counterexample.{sup:9}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 5">
       We have shown in Example 2 that in the running example of Fig. 1 the outcome of {a mathematical formula}FCO is a unique labelling in all cases, thus by definition it coincides with the outcome of {a mathematical formula}FGR and {a mathematical formula}FPR. Given the compatibility constraint, exactly two global labellings arise from the combinations of the outcomes of {a mathematical formula}FCO, namely {a mathematical formula}{(A,undec),(B,undec),(C,undec),(D,undec)} and {a mathematical formula}{(A,out),(B,in),(C,out),(D,in)}. The former is the grounded labelling, the latter is the preferred labelling: it turns out that the combination of two “locally grounded” labellings gives rise not just to the “global” grounded labelling but also to the preferred labelling, and analogously that the combination of two “locally preferred” labellings gives rise not just to the “global” preferred labelling but also to the grounded one. This shows that grounded and preferred semantics are not bottom-up decomposable.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Now, a question arises as to whether satisfying the minimization/maximization requirement at the level of the whole argumentation framework entails that such requirement is satisfied at the local level, i.e. whether grounded and preferred semantics are top-down decomposable. This result turns out to be true and is achieved through some intermediate steps.

      <paragraph>
       First, Lemma 1 shows that if a labelling produced by {a mathematical formula}FAD does not belong to {a mathematical formula}FCO then there is an undec-labelled argument which can be labelled in or out obtaining a labelling still in {a mathematical formula}FAD.

       While preferred and complete semantics fail to achieve bottom-up decomposability for arbitrary partitions, they turn out to be bottom-up decomposable (thus fully decomposable) w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}F∪SCC. The result, proved in Theorem 7, is based on a preliminary lemma, which roughly states that if a semantics S is top-down decomposable then a kind of top-down decomposability relation holds for any labelling {a mathematical formula}L∈FS(AF,I,LI,RI) w.r.t. any set of arguments P in AF. More specifically, given such a labelling L and P, it is possible to refer to a “restricted” argumentation framework with input based on P, namely {a mathematical formula}(AF↓P,PF-inp,(L∪LI)↓PF-inp,PFR), where intuitively {a mathematical formula}PF-inp, {a mathematical formula}(L∪LI)↓PF-inp, and {a mathematical formula}PFR are obtained by considering both {a mathematical formula}I and AF (outside P). Then, the restriction of L to P is produced by {a mathematical formula}FS when applied to the restricted argumentation framework with input mentioned above.

It holds that {a mathematical formula}P1inp={C,D}, {a mathematical formula}P1R={(C,E),(D,E)}, {a mathematical formula}P2inp={A}, {a mathematical formula}P2R={(A,B)}. Note that the partition is not “acyclic”, in that {a mathematical formula}P1 attacks {a mathematical formula}P2 and {a mathematical formula}P2 attacks {a mathematical formula}P1. We show that both in the case of grounded semantics and of preferred semantics the union of compatible local labellings gives rise to the grounded labelling or a preferred labelling, respectively. First, note that any labelling returned by {a mathematical formula}FGR and {a mathematical formula}FPR applied to {a mathematical formula}AF↓P1 prescribes that A is labelled in, therefore it suffices to consider the labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A,in)} for the unique input argument of {a mathematical formula}P2.

       Ideal semantics
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Similarly to the cases analyzed in the previous sections, the canonical local function of ideal semantics corresponds to an extension of the definition of ideal labelling. The following proposition identifies the relevant definition, also showing that it is well founded (in particular, that {a mathematical formula}FID(AF,I,LI,RI) always returns a unique labelling).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 8">
       The canonical local function of ideal semantics is defined as{a mathematical formula}FID(AF,I,LI,RI)≜{L⁎}, where{a mathematical formula}L⁎is the maximal (w.r.t. ⊑) labelling in{a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI)such that for each{a mathematical formula}LP∈FPR(AF,I,LI,RI)it holds that{a mathematical formula}L⁎⊑LP.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Ideal semantics has some common features both with preferred and with grounded semantics: on the one hand, its definition is based on the preferred labellings, on the other hand it yields a unique labelling, like the grounded semantics. As a matter of fact, a formal skepticism comparison between semantics shows that ideal semantics lies between grounded and preferred semantics [9]. Ideal semantics does not inherit any decomposability property from them: the following example shows that ideal semantics is neither top-down nor bottom-up decomposable even w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}FSCC.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 7">
       {a mathematical formula}AF=({A,B,C,D,E},{(A,B),(B,A),(A,C),(C,A),(B,C),(C,B),(C,D),(D,E),(E,D)}) has the unique partition {a mathematical formula}{S1,S2}∈FSCC(AF), where {a mathematical formula}S1={A,B,C} and {a mathematical formula}S2={D,E} are the strongly connected components of AF (see Fig. 4). There are 5 preferred labellings of AF and there is no argument which is labelled in in all of them, thus the ideal labelling {a mathematical formula}L⁎ leaves all of the arguments undecided. To show that ideal semantics is not top-down decomposable w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}FSCC, it is sufficient to note that {a mathematical formula}L⁎↓S2={(D,undec),(E,undec)}, while it turns out that {a mathematical formula}FID(AF↓S2,{C},{(C,undec)},{(C,D)})={{(D,out),(E,in)}}.To show that ideal semantics is not bottom-up decomposable w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}FSCC, consider first the application of {a mathematical formula}FID to {a mathematical formula}AF↓S1: it is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}FID(AF↓S1,∅,∅,∅)={(A,undec),(B,undec),(C,undec)}, since {a mathematical formula}AF↓S1 admits the three preferred labellings where one of the three arguments {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C} is in and the others are out. Moreover, we already know that {a mathematical formula}FID(AF↓S2,{C},{(C,undec)},{(C,D)})={{(D,out),(E,in)}}, thus the labellings {a mathematical formula}{(A,undec),(B,undec),(C,undec)} and {a mathematical formula}{{(D,out),(E,in)}} are compatible. However, the union of these two labellings does not coincide with the ideal labelling {a mathematical formula}L⁎.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The previous example contradicts{sup:10} a result presented in [33], according to which ideal semantics is decomposable w.r.t. partitions including two elements one of which is unattacked (i.e. does not receive attacks from outside, {a mathematical formula}S1 in Fig. 4). The reason why ideal semantics is not decomposable is that, considering a strongly connected component P, the restriction of the ideal labelling to the input arguments of P does not always carry enough information to compute the restriction of the ideal labelling to P. In the previous example, argument C is labelled undec by the ideal labelling while it is labelled in or out by the preferred labellings, i.e. those which actually determine the ideal labelling according to Definition 8.

       Semi-stable semantics
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The definition of semi-stable semantics somewhat resembles that of preferred semantics, in that semi-stable labellings correspond to those preferred labellings which satisfy the additional requirement of minimizing the set of arguments labelled undec. The following proposition shows that the canonical local function is defined accordingly.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 9">
       The canonical local function of semi-stable semantics is defined as{a mathematical formula}FSST(AF,I,LI,RI)≜{L|L∈FCO(AF,I,LI,RI)such thatundec(L)is minimal w.r.t. set inclusion}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Differently from all semantics considered above, semi-stable semantics is not directional [8], i.e. given an unattacked set of arguments S the labellings computed in {a mathematical formula}AF↓S do not correspond to the restrictions of the labellings of AF in S. As shown in the following two examples, this behavior prevents the satisfaction of top-down and bottom-up decomposability even w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}FSCC.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 8">
       To show that semi-stable semantics is not top-down decomposable w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}FSCC, consider {a mathematical formula}AF=({A,B,C,D},{(A,B),(B,A),(B,C),(C,B),(C,C),(A,D),(D,D)}), where {a mathematical formula}SCCSAF={P1,P2} with {a mathematical formula}P1={A,B,C} and {a mathematical formula}P2={D} (see Fig. 5). There are two semi-stable labellings in AF, namely {a mathematical formula}L1={(A,in),(B,out),(C,undec),(D,out)} and {a mathematical formula}L2={(A,out),(B,in),(C,out),(D,undec)}. Consider then the partition {a mathematical formula}{P1,P2}∈FSCC(AF) where {a mathematical formula}P1 is unattacked. Note in particular that {a mathematical formula}L1↓P1={(A,in),(B,out),(C,undec)}, which however does not belong to {a mathematical formula}FSST(AF↓P1,∅,∅,∅), since the only semi-stable labelling in {a mathematical formula}AF↓P1 is {a mathematical formula}{(A,out),(B,in),(C,out)}.
      </paragraph>

It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}{(A,in),(B,out)}∈FSST(AF↓P1,∅,∅,∅), and that {a mathematical formula}FSST(AF↓P2,{B},{(B,out)},{(B,C)})={{(C,undec)}}. Now, the union of these compatible labellings, i.e. {a mathematical formula}{(A,in),(B,out),(C,undec)}, is not a semi-stable labelling of AF, since the unique semi-stable labelling of AF is {a mathematical formula}{(A,out),(B,in),(C,out)}.

      Effect-dictated semantics
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      This short section introduces the simple concept of effect-dictated semantics, which is crucial for the analysis to be carried out in the next section. For every semantics S analyzed in Section 4, it can be noted that {a mathematical formula}FS(AF,I,LI,RI) may return the same result given different {a mathematical formula}I, {a mathematical formula}LI and {a mathematical formula}RI. For instance, if an argument A of AF is attacked by an argument of {a mathematical formula}I which is labelled in, then {a mathematical formula}FS returns the same set of labellings independently of the presence and the number of additional attackers of A in {a mathematical formula}I. The effect of {a mathematical formula}(I,LI,RI) on the arguments Args of AF can be modelled as the labelling that would be induced on Args by neglecting the attacks inside AF. For instance, if an argument A of AF is only attacked through {a mathematical formula}RI by out-labelled arguments according to {a mathematical formula}LI, then A would be in in the case that it does not receive other attacks inside AF.{sup:11} The following definition formalizes this intuition.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 26">
      Given a set of arguments {a mathematical formula}I, a labelling {a mathematical formula}LI∈LI, a set of arguments Args such that {a mathematical formula}I∩Args=∅ and a relation {a mathematical formula}RINP⊆I×Args, the effect of {a mathematical formula}(I,LI,RINP) on Args, denoted as {a mathematical formula}effArgs(I,LI,RINP), is defined as{a mathematical formula}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      By definition, {a mathematical formula}effArgs(I,LI,RINP) only depends on the labelling of the arguments in {a mathematical formula}I that attack Args through {a mathematical formula}RINP. Moreover each argument in Args not receiving attacks from {a mathematical formula}I is labelled in according to {a mathematical formula}effArgs(I,LI,RINP). Thus, in the particular case where {a mathematical formula}I=∅ (thus also {a mathematical formula}LI and {a mathematical formula}RINP are empty), it turns out that {a mathematical formula}effArgs(∅,∅,∅)={(A,in)|A∈Args}.

      Argumentation multipoles and their interchangeability
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      In this section, we introduce argumentation multipoles, that are conceived as modular components equipped with a well-defined interface to connect with each other and may play the role of “partial” frameworks in the context of a global one. This yields the possibility of replacing a component with another one which is equivalent as far as the Input/Output behavior is concerned.

      <section-title>
       The notion of argumentation multipole
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The first step to provide a systematic treatment of argumentation multipoles is to identify a definition to capture their structure in the most general way. To this aim, we consider a number of examples, starting from a common component, i.e. a chain of arguments.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 10">
       Consider the argumentation frameworks {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2 shown in Fig. 7. {a mathematical formula}AF2 can be obtained from {a mathematical formula}AF1 by “summarizing” the component {a mathematical formula}M1, including the arguments {a mathematical formula}A1,A2,A3,A4, with the component {a mathematical formula}M2, including the arguments {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}A2: according to any complete-compatible semantics considered in this paper, the labellings restricted to {a mathematical formula}E1 and {a mathematical formula}E2, i.e. the arguments common to {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2, are the same in the two frameworks, i.e. {a mathematical formula}E1 is labelled in and {a mathematical formula}E2 is labelled out. More generally, consider a finite sequence of n arguments {a mathematical formula}A1,…,An such that each argument attacks the subsequent one, i.e. {a mathematical formula}Ai attacks {a mathematical formula}Ai+1 with {a mathematical formula}1≤i&lt;n and suppose that only {a mathematical formula}A1 can receive further attacks from other arguments and only {a mathematical formula}An can attack other arguments. Then it is intuitive to see that the “black-box behavior” of a sequence of arguments of this kind, whose external “terminals” are {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}An, only depends on whether n is even or odd. In fact, the behavior of any even-length sequence is the same as in the case {a mathematical formula}n=2 (if {a mathematical formula}A1 is in then {a mathematical formula}An is out, if {a mathematical formula}A1 is out then {a mathematical formula}An is in, if {a mathematical formula}A1 is undec then {a mathematical formula}An is undec), while for any odd-length sequence the behavior is the same as the one of {a mathematical formula}A1 alone (with n odd, {a mathematical formula}An gets necessarily the same label as {a mathematical formula}A1).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       On the basis of the previous example, a modular component may tentatively be defined as an argumentation framework{sup:12} where the “input terminals” and the “output terminals” are explicitly identified (e.g. {a mathematical formula}AF1↓{A1,…,A4} in the example, where {a mathematical formula}A1 is the unique input terminal and {a mathematical formula}A4 in the unique output terminal). Two components can be interchanged only if they have the same input and output terminals, and this interchange does not modify the attacks relating these terminals with the unchanged arguments ({a mathematical formula}E1 and {a mathematical formula}E2 in the example). However, the following two examples show that this approach is too restrictive, since there are cases where it is useful to modify both the set of input and output terminals as well as the relevant attack relation.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 11">
       Consider the argumentation frameworks {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2 shown in Fig. 8. {a mathematical formula}AF2 can be obtained from {a mathematical formula}AF1 by summarizing the component {a mathematical formula}M1, including the arguments {a mathematical formula}A1,A2,B1,B2,O, with the component {a mathematical formula}M2 including the argument O only: according to all complete-compatible semantics considered in this paper the arguments {a mathematical formula}E1, {a mathematical formula}E2 and {a mathematical formula}E3 are labelled in both in {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2. More generally, the black-box behavior of {a mathematical formula}M1 is the same as the one of {a mathematical formula}M2, since in {a mathematical formula}M1{a mathematical formula}A2 gets the same label as {a mathematical formula}E1 and {a mathematical formula}B2 gets the same label as {a mathematical formula}E2, thus the label of O is the same as in {a mathematical formula}M2. As a consequence, one may expect that {a mathematical formula}M1 can be interchanged with {a mathematical formula}M2 also in more articulated examples. Note that while {a mathematical formula}M1 has two input terminals, {a mathematical formula}M2 has only one input terminal coinciding with the unique output one.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 12">
       Consider the argumentation frameworks {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2 shown in Fig. 9 and assume preferred semantics is adopted. {a mathematical formula}AF2 can be obtained from {a mathematical formula}AF1 by summarizing the component {a mathematical formula}M1, including the arguments {a mathematical formula}A1,A2 and O, with the component {a mathematical formula}M2 including the arguments I and O: both in {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2 the argument {a mathematical formula}E1 is labelled in, {a mathematical formula}E2 is labelled out and {a mathematical formula}E3 is labelled in. More generally, under preferred semantics the black-box behavior of {a mathematical formula}M1 is the same as the one of {a mathematical formula}M2: if {a mathematical formula}E2 is in then O is in, if {a mathematical formula}E2 is out then O is out (in particular {a mathematical formula}M1 admits a labelling where {a mathematical formula}A1 is in, {a mathematical formula}A2 is out and O is out, and a labelling where {a mathematical formula}A1 is out, {a mathematical formula}A2 is in and O is out), if {a mathematical formula}E2 is undec then O is undec. As a consequence, one may expect that {a mathematical formula}M1 can be interchanged with {a mathematical formula}M2 also in more articulated examples. Note that while {a mathematical formula}M1 receives two attacks from {a mathematical formula}E2 in {a mathematical formula}AF1, {a mathematical formula}M2 receives one attack only in {a mathematical formula}AF2.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The previous examples show that the definition of a modular component should include the input attack relation{a mathematical formula}RINP, consisting of the attacks from the arguments that are not part of the component to the arguments that belong to the component itself: this way, the definition leaves room for replacements of modular components that lead to changes in the input attack relation, as in the previous example. A similar reasoning concerns the output attack relation{a mathematical formula}ROUTP, including the attacks from a modular component towards the outside arguments. In any case, there is no need to explicitly model the input and output terminals, since they can easily be derived from the input and output attack relations. Inspired by the digital logic field, we call the resulting structure an Argumentation Multipole. In order to express {a mathematical formula}RINP and {a mathematical formula}ROUTP, without loss of generality we define an Argumentation Multipole w.r.t. a set E, i.e. w.r.t. the set of arguments that are not part of the multipole and thus remain unchanged if the multipole is replaced.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 28">
       An Argumentation Multipole (or, briefly, multipole) {a mathematical formula}M w.r.t. a set E is a tuple {a mathematical formula}(AF,RINP,ROUTP), where letting {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) it holds that {a mathematical formula}Ar∩E=∅, {a mathematical formula}RINP⊆E×Ar, and {a mathematical formula}ROUTP⊆Ar×E. Extending the notation introduced in Definition 10, we denote as {a mathematical formula}Minp the set {a mathematical formula}{A∈E|∃B∈Ar,(A,B)∈RINP}, i.e. including the arguments of E which attack Ar through {a mathematical formula}RINP. Moreover, we denote as {a mathematical formula}Moutp the set {a mathematical formula}{A∈Ar|∃B∈E,(A,B)∈ROUTP}, i.e. including the arguments of AF attacking E through {a mathematical formula}ROUTP.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Fig. 10 provides a graphical representation of the definition. For instance, in Example 10{a mathematical formula}M1=(AF1↓{A1,A2,A3,A4},{(E1,A1)},{(A4,E2)}) and {a mathematical formula}M2=(AF2↓{A1,A2},{(E1,A1)},{(A2,E2)}), in Example 11 it holds that {a mathematical formula}M1=(AF1↓{A1,A2,B1,B2,O},{(E1,A1),(E2,B1)},{(O,E3)}) and {a mathematical formula}M2=(AF2↓{O},{(E1,O),(E2,O)},{(O,E3)}), in Example 12{a mathematical formula}M1=(AF1↓{A1,A2,O},{(E2,A1),(E2,A2)},{(O,E3)}) and {a mathematical formula}M2=(AF2↓{I,O},{(E2,I)},{(O,E3)}).

       A particular multipole which is useful to consider in some practical examples is the empty multipole{a mathematical formula}M∅≜(AF∅,∅,∅), i.e. including the empty argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF∅. It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}M∅inp=M∅outp=∅.

       When a multipole w.r.t. a set E is “connected to the external world” it “receives” some input from outside through the relation {a mathematical formula}RINP and “produces” an output which is induced by the labellings of the multipole and transferred to the set E through the relation {a mathematical formula}ROUTP. Technically speaking, the labellings and thus the relation between input and output are determined by a (semantics specific) local function, thus the equivalence relation between argumentation multipoles depends on the considered semantics S, and is called S-equivalence to reflect this dependency. For instance, in Example 12{a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are PR-equivalent (i.e. equivalent under preferred semantics), while they are not GR-equivalent, since under grounded semantics if {a mathematical formula}E2 is labelled out then O in {a mathematical formula}M1 is labelled undec, while O in {a mathematical formula}M2 is labelled out. Intuitively, {a mathematical formula}M1 is GR-equivalent e.g. to a multipole {a mathematical formula}M2′ obtained from {a mathematical formula}M2 by adding a self-attack from I to I itself.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       According to the above examples, two argumentation multipoles w.r.t. the same set E may be tentatively defined as S-equivalent if for any possible input, i.e. any labelling of E, {a mathematical formula}FS produces the same labellings of the output terminals in the two argumentation multipoles. For instance, in Example 12 under preferred semantics O is in for any labelling where {a mathematical formula}E2 is in, it is out for any labelling where {a mathematical formula}E2 is out and it is undec for any labelling where {a mathematical formula}E2 is undec. However, this approach works only in case the two multipoles have the same output terminals. Moreover, as the following example shows, the way E is affected by the labellings of an argumentation multipole {a mathematical formula}(AF,RINP,ROUTP) also depends on the attack relation {a mathematical formula}ROUTP.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 13">
       Consider the argumentation frameworks {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2 shown in Fig. 11 and the application of preferred semantics. The multipole {a mathematical formula}M1=(AF1↓{O1,O2},∅,{(O1,E),(O2,E)}) w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}{E} in {a mathematical formula}AF1 affects the argument E by means of the two arguments {a mathematical formula}O1 and {a mathematical formula}O2, while {a mathematical formula}M2=(AF2↓{O},∅,{(O,E)}) in {a mathematical formula}AF2 affects E by means of the argument O. Intuitively, under preferred semantics {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are equivalent: in {a mathematical formula}M1 there are two preferred labellings, i.e. {a mathematical formula}{(O1,in),(O2,out)} and {a mathematical formula}{(O1,out),(O2,in)}, thus in any case an argument labelled in attacks E making it out, and similarly {a mathematical formula}M2 interacts with E making it out, since {a mathematical formula}M2 admits the unique labelling {a mathematical formula}{(O,in)}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We can formalize these intuitions by extending the notion of effect to multipoles (see Definition 26). Let us consider a semantics S. Given a multipole {a mathematical formula}M w.r.t. a set E, for any “input” labelling {a mathematical formula}LE∈LE the local function {a mathematical formula}FS prescribes a set of labellings for {a mathematical formula}M. Each of these labellings has its own effect on E, therefore the global effect of the multipole receiving an input {a mathematical formula}LE is a set of labellings of E whose members are all the single effects.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 29">
       Let {a mathematical formula}M=(AF,RINP,ROUTP) a multipole w.r.t. a set E and S an argumentation semantics. Given a labelling {a mathematical formula}LE∈LE, the S-effect of {a mathematical formula}(M,LE) on E, denoted as {a mathematical formula}S-effE(M,LE), is defined as {a mathematical formula}{effE(Moutp,L↓Moutp,ROUTP)|L∈FS(AF,Minp,LE↓Minp,RINP)}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Note that if {a mathematical formula}FS(AF,Minp,LE↓Minp,RINP)=∅, i.e. the local function prescribes no labelling, then {a mathematical formula}S-effE(M,LE)=∅.

Similarly, {a mathematical formula}M2 has two preferred labellings, one where {a mathematical formula}B2 is in and another where {a mathematical formula}B2 is out, leading to {a mathematical formula}PR-eff{E}(M1,∅)=PR-eff{E}(M2,∅).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It is worth considering the effect of the empty multipole {a mathematical formula}M∅. Intuitively, {a mathematical formula}M∅ should have no effect on the arguments of E, i.e. all of them should be assigned the label in according to the effect itself. Technically, this is guaranteed if the semantics is defined in such a way as to prescribe the unique possible labelling ∅ to the empty argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF∅, as it happens for any semantics considered in this paper. Intuitively, if this were not the case the empty multipole would prevent the identification of any labelling for the whole argumentation framework, yielding to a pathological behavior. Accordingly, the condition {a mathematical formula}LS(AF∅)={∅} is required in all the following propositions and theorems{sup:13} referring to a generic semantics S.

       Replacements and transparent argumentation semantics
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       As anticipated by previous examples, an argumentation multipole can be viewed as a component of an argumentation framework that can be replaced with another multipole giving rise to a (possibly) different argumentation framework. In particular, given an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), one may partition the set of arguments Args into two sets, i.e. a set E which is not involved in the replacement and the set {a mathematical formula}D1=Ar∖E which is replaced along with the relevant attacks: the set {a mathematical formula}D1 identifies the multipole {a mathematical formula}M1=(AF↓D1,att∩(E×D1),att∩(D1×E)) w.r.t. E, which can be replaced with another multipole {a mathematical formula}M2 w.r.t. the same set E. For later use in the paper, it is worth identifying those replacements such that a partition belonging to the set returned by a selector {a mathematical formula}F is enforced both before and after the replacement.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 31">
       Let {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) be an argumentation framework, and {a mathematical formula}E⊆Ar be a subset of its arguments. Let {a mathematical formula}D1=Ar∖E, {a mathematical formula}RINP1=att∩(E×D1) and {a mathematical formula}ROUTP1=att∩(D1×E). A replacement{a mathematical formula}R is a tuple {a mathematical formula}(AF,M1,M2) where {a mathematical formula}M1=(AF↓D1,RINP1,ROUTP1) and {a mathematical formula}M2 is an argumentation multipole w.r.t. E. The set E is called the invariant set of the replacement {a mathematical formula}R. Assuming {a mathematical formula}M2=((D2,RD2),RINP2,ROUTP2), the result of the replacement {a mathematical formula}R, denoted as {a mathematical formula}T(R), is the argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF2=(E∪D2,(att∩E×E)∪RINP2∪RD2∪ROUTP2). Given a partition selector {a mathematical formula}F, a replacement {a mathematical formula}(AF,M1,M2) is {a mathematical formula}F-preserving if both {a mathematical formula}({E,D1}∖∅)∈F(AF) and {a mathematical formula}({E,D2}∖∅)∈F(T(AF,M1,M2)).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}T(AF,M1,M1)=AF. Moreover, letting {a mathematical formula}AF2=T(AF,M1,M2) it holds that {a mathematical formula}T(AF2,M2,M1)=AF. Note that, in the definition of {a mathematical formula}F-preserving replacement, the empty set is excluded from the requirement of belonging to {a mathematical formula}F(AF). The reason is that by definition the empty set does not belong to any partition, however in case one of the sets in {a mathematical formula}{E,D1} or {a mathematical formula}{E,D2} is empty then it is sensible to require only the nonempty set to belong to {a mathematical formula}F(AF).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In Example 10, Example 11, Example 12, Example 13, Example 14, the result of the replacement {a mathematical formula}(AF1,M1,M2) is the argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF2.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       While Definition 31 leaves room for any possible replacement, not all of them can be considered legitimate. In particular, we seek for replacements involving multipoles having the same Input/Output behavior, otherwise in most cases the labellings of the resulting frameworks would be different in the invariant set E, leading to changes in the status assignment of the relevant arguments. For instance, in Example 10 replacing {a mathematical formula}M1 in {a mathematical formula}AF1 with a multipole including a single argument (or an odd-length chain of arguments) would change the label assigned to {a mathematical formula}E2 from out to in. In order to explore the notion of legitimate replacements, let us consider an issue arising e.g. in the following example.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 15">
       Consider the application of preferred semantics on the argumentation frameworks {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2 shown in Fig. 13, where {a mathematical formula}M1=(AF1↓{A1,A2,A3},{(E1,A1),(E2,A1)},{(A3,E1)}) and {a mathematical formula}M2=(AF2↓{C},{(E1,C),(E2,C)},{(C,E1)}) are two argumentation multipoles w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}{E1,E2}, {a mathematical formula}AF2=T(R) with {a mathematical formula}R=(AF1,M1,M2), and the invariant set of the replacement {a mathematical formula}R is {a mathematical formula}E={E1,E2}. The multipole {a mathematical formula}M1 is notPR-equivalent to {a mathematical formula}M2: considering the labelling {a mathematical formula}{(E1,out),(E2,out)}{a mathematical formula}FPR prescribes for {a mathematical formula}M1 the unique labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A1,undec),(A2,undec),(A3,undec)}, whose effect on {a mathematical formula}{E1,E2} is {a mathematical formula}{(E1,undec),(E2,in)}, while {a mathematical formula}FPR prescribes for {a mathematical formula}M2 the unique labelling {a mathematical formula}{(C,in)}, whose effect on {a mathematical formula}{E1,E2} is {a mathematical formula}{(E1,out),(E2,in)}. However, taking into account the possible labellings of {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2, it can be noted that the labelling {a mathematical formula}{(E1,out),(E2,out)} is impossible both in {a mathematical formula}AF1 and in {a mathematical formula}AF2. As to {a mathematical formula}AF1, if {a mathematical formula}A3 is in then {a mathematical formula}FPR prescribes for {a mathematical formula}{E1,E2} the labelling {a mathematical formula}{(E1,out),(E2,in)}, if {a mathematical formula}A3 is out then it prescribes the labellings {a mathematical formula}{(E1,out),(E2,in)} and {a mathematical formula}{(E1,in),(E2,out)}, if {a mathematical formula}A3 is undec then it prescribes the labelling {a mathematical formula}{(E1,out),(E2,in)}. As to {a mathematical formula}AF2, the situation is the same. Summing up, the set of labellings that can be “seen” by {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 is {a mathematical formula}LRPR={{(E1,out),(E2,in)},{(E1,in),(E2,out)}}, under which {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 turn out to be PR-equivalent. In fact, for each of the labellings in {a mathematical formula}LRPR, {a mathematical formula}FPR prescribes for {a mathematical formula}M1 the unique labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A1,out),(A2,in),(A3,out)}, whose effect on {a mathematical formula}{E1,E2} is {a mathematical formula}{(E1,in),(E2,in)}, and {a mathematical formula}FPR prescribes for {a mathematical formula}M2 the unique labelling {a mathematical formula}{(C,out)}, whose effect on {a mathematical formula}{E1,E2} is again {a mathematical formula}{(E1,in),(E2,in)}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Thus, a replacement may be considered as legitimate even if the involved multipoles are not equivalent under all labellings, provided that they are equivalent under the possible ones (in a sense, input labellings that never occur are neglected as the “don't care terms” in digital logic). Of course, one may accept to replace a multipole only with an equivalent one, since in this case equivalence holds independently of the context (in particular, the multipoles would remain equivalent even modifying the attack relations between arguments of the invariant set E). In order to distinguish between the two cases, a replacement is called contextually legitimate in the first case, and simply legitimate in the latter. Independently of its legitimacy properties, we call safe a replacement that does not yield modifications of the labellings in E.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 32">
       Let S be an argumentation semantics and {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) be an argumentation framework. A replacement {a mathematical formula}R=(AF,M1,M2) with invariant set E is S-legitimate if {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are S-equivalent, it is contextuallyS-legitimate if {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are S-equivalent under {a mathematical formula}LRS, where {a mathematical formula}LRS≜{FS(AF↓E,M1outp,L1,ROUTP1)|L1∈LM1outp}∪{FS(AF↓E,M2outp,L2,ROUTP2)|L2∈LM2outp}. Moreover, {a mathematical formula}R is S-safe if {a mathematical formula}{L↓E|L∈LS(AF)}={L↓E|L∈LS(T(AF,M1,M2))}.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It is easy to see that every legitimate replacement is also contextually legitimate. For instance, in Example 12 the replacement {a mathematical formula}(AF1,M1,M2) is PR-legitimate and PR-safe, it is not contextually GR-legitimate nor GR-safe. In Example 15 the replacement {a mathematical formula}(AF1,M1,M2) is contextually PR-legitimate (but not PR-legitimate) and PR-safe, and the same holds according to grounded semantics.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The examples presented so far may give the impression that for any semantics S a (possibly contextually) S-legitimate replacement is always S-safe, i.e. replacing a multipole with an equivalent multipole preserves the labellings in the invariant set of the replacement. This property may seem natural and easy to prove, however it is shown in Section 8 that it does not hold for all semantics: we denote as transparent the semantics such that legitimate replacements are always safe, strongly transparent the semantics such that contextually legitimate replacements are always safe. Similarly to decomposability, also transparency may hold under a restriction on the partition identified by the multipoles that are replaced: accordingly, we introduce the concept of transparency w.r.t. a partition selector {a mathematical formula}F.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 33">
       A semantics S is transparent if any S-legitimate replacement is S-safe, it is strongly transparent if any contextually S-legitimate replacement is S-safe. Given a partition selector {a mathematical formula}F, a semantics S is transparent w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}F if any {a mathematical formula}F-preserving and S-legitimate replacement is S-safe, it is strongly transparent w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}F if any {a mathematical formula}F-preserving and contextually S-legitimate replacement is S-safe.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Since any ({a mathematical formula}F-preserving) legitimate replacement is also contextually legitimate, any strongly transparent semantics (w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}F) is also transparent (w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}F).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       A limit case which is theoretically interesting to consider is a replacement {a mathematical formula}(AF,M1,M2) with the invariant set E equal to the empty set, i.e. when an entire argumentation framework is replaced by another one.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 12">

       Intuitively, there are no preserved arguments, thus the effect of any labelling of AF on the outside empty set is the same as the effect of any labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF2. The only difference arises in the case that AF “crashes” (i.e. admits no labellings) while {a mathematical formula}AF2 does not exhibit such pathological behavior, or vice versa.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Note that the notions of replacement and transparent semantics refer to partitions of argumentation frameworks into just two subframeworks, i.e. one corresponding to the replaced multipole {a mathematical formula}M1 (or the replacing one {a mathematical formula}M2) and the other identified by the invariant set E. This is not restrictive, since one can treat a multiple replacement of several multipoles as a sequence of replacements each involving just one multipole. The following proposition shows that safeness is preserved by a sequence of safe replacements, and the same holds for skeptical and credulous justification of those arguments that are not replaced.

      The relationship between decomposability and transparency
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Intuitively, there is a close relationship between decomposability and transparency: if a semantics is decomposable, i.e. the labellings prescribed for an argumentation framework are completely determined by applying the canonical local function to the elements of a partition, then one may expect that replacing a multipole with another one having the same Input/Output behavior has no impact on the invariant set of the replacement. This intuition is confirmed by Theorem 8, showing that decomposability of a semantics S is a sufficient condition for strong transparency.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Theorem 8">
      Consider an effect-dictated semanticsSsuch that{a mathematical formula}LS(AF∅)={∅}. IfSis decomposable w.r.t. a partition selector{a mathematical formula}FthenSis strongly transparent w.r.t.{a mathematical formula}F.

      While full decomposability is a sufficient condition for strong transparency, it is not necessary. In particular, for a single-status semantics which is top-down decomposable a relaxed form of bottom-up decomposability is sufficient to ensure strong transparency. More specifically, in this case bottom-up decomposability requires the union of local labellings to coincide with the (unique) global labelling. However, just requiring the union of local labellings to be more or equally committed than the global labelling is enough to achieve strong transparency, as shown by Theorem 9.

In Example 15 the replacement {a mathematical formula}R=(AF1,M1,M2) is contextually GR-legitimate, since {a mathematical formula}LRGR={{(E1,undec),(E2,undec)},{(E1,out),(E2,in)}} and {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are GR-equivalent under {a mathematical formula}LRGR: as a consequence, {a mathematical formula}R is GR-safe, as it can be seen by considering that both the grounded labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF1 and the grounded labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF2 assign to all arguments the label undec.

       Preferred semantics
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Like grounded semantics, preferred semantics is top-down decomposable but not fully decomposable. However, differently from grounded semantics, preferred semantics is not transparent, as shown by the following counterexample.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 16">
       Consider the argumentation frameworks {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2 shown in Fig. 14, where {a mathematical formula}AF2=T(R) with {a mathematical formula}R=(AF1,M1,M2), and the invariant set of the replacement {a mathematical formula}R is {a mathematical formula}E={E1,E2}. It turns out that {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are PR-equivalent, thus {a mathematical formula}R is PR-legitimate. In fact, for any label {a mathematical formula}Lin∈LE such that {a mathematical formula}E1 is labelled in the local function {a mathematical formula}FPR prescribes for {a mathematical formula}M1 the unique labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A1,out),(A2,in),(O,undec)}, therefore {a mathematical formula}PR-effE(M1,Lin)={{(E2,undec),(E1,in)}}, and it prescribes for {a mathematical formula}M2 the unique labelling {a mathematical formula}{(B,out),(C,in),(A1,out),(A2,out),(O,undec)}, therefore also {a mathematical formula}PR-effE(M2,Lin)={{(E2,undec),(E1,in)}}. For any label {a mathematical formula}Lout∈LE such that {a mathematical formula}E1 is labelled out{a mathematical formula}FPR prescribes for {a mathematical formula}M1 the labellings {a mathematical formula}{(A1,in),(A2,out),(O,out)} and {a mathematical formula}{(A1,out),(A2,in),(O,undec)}, for {a mathematical formula}M2 the labellings {a mathematical formula}{(B,in),(C,out),(A1,in),(A2,out),(O,out)} and {a mathematical formula}{(B,in),(C,out),(A1,out),(A2,in),(O,undec)}, thus {a mathematical formula}PR-effE(M1,Lout)=PR-effE(M2,Lout)={{(E2,in),(E1,in)},{(E2,undec),(E1,in)}}. For any label {a mathematical formula}Lundec∈LE such that {a mathematical formula}E1 is labelled undec, {a mathematical formula}FPR prescribes for {a mathematical formula}M1 the unique labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A1,out),(A2,in),(O,undec)}, and it prescribes for {a mathematical formula}M2 the unique labelling {a mathematical formula}{(B,undec),(C,undec),(A1,undec),(A2,undec),(O,undec)}, therefore {a mathematical formula}PR-effE(M1,Lundec)=PR-effE(M2,Lundec)={{(E2,undec),(E1,in)}}. However, the replacement {a mathematical formula}(AF1,M1,M2) is not PR-safe. In fact, the preferred labellings of {a mathematical formula}AF1 are {a mathematical formula}{(A1,in),(A2,out),(O,out),(E2,in),(E1,out)} and {a mathematical formula}{(A1,out),(A2,in),(O,undec),(E2,undec),(E1,undec)}, while {a mathematical formula}{(B,in),(C,out),(A1,in),(A2,out),(O,out),(E2,in),(E1,out)} is the only preferred labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF2. Note in particular that {a mathematical formula}E2 is skeptically justified in {a mathematical formula}AF2 but not in {a mathematical formula}AF1. Interestingly enough, considering the application of stable semantics it can be checked that the replacement {a mathematical formula}(AF1,M1,M2) is ST-legitimate, therefore according to Theorem 10 it is also ST-safe. In fact, {a mathematical formula}LST(AF1)={{(A1,in),(A2,out),(O,out),(E2,in),(E1,out)}} and {a mathematical formula}LST(AF2)={{(B,in),(C,out),(A1,in),(A2,out),(O,out),(E2,in),(E1,out)}}, therefore both in {a mathematical formula}AF1 and in {a mathematical formula}AF2 the argument {a mathematical formula}E1 is labelled out and {a mathematical formula}E2 is labelled in by all stable labellings.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In the previous example a PR-legitimate replacement yields a change in the status assignment of arguments belonging to the invariant set E, however it can be noted that their credulous justification is preserved, i.e. {a mathematical formula}E2 is credulously justified both in {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2, {a mathematical formula}E1 is not credulously justified either in {a mathematical formula}AF1 or in {a mathematical formula}AF2. Theorem 12 proves that this result holds in general.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 12">
       For any contextuallyPR-legitimate replacement{a mathematical formula}R=(AF,M1,M2)with invariant set E, any argument{a mathematical formula}A∈Eis credulously justified according toPRin AF if and only if it is credulously justified according toPRin{a mathematical formula}T(AF,M1,M2).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       While the obtained result is somewhat weak, as it concerns credulous justification only, it has to be acknowledged that the counterexample against transparency of PR (Example 16) is rather tricky. In particular, {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are PR-equivalent, but they differ in the following aspect. On the one hand, in {a mathematical formula}M1, the local function {a mathematical formula}FPR prescribes for any input labelling {a mathematical formula}Lundec the unique labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A1,out),(A2,in),(O,undec)}, and with the “more committed” input labelling {a mathematical formula}Lout∈LE it returns (among others) the labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A1,in),(A2,out),(O,out)} which is not “more committed” than {a mathematical formula}{(A1,out),(A2,in),(O,undec)}, i.e. it is not the case that {a mathematical formula}{(A1,out),(A2,in),(O,undec)}⊑{(A1,in),(A2,out),(O,out)}. On the other hand, in {a mathematical formula}M2 both the labellings returned by the local function {a mathematical formula}FPR with the input labelling {a mathematical formula}Lout are “more committed” than the labelling returned by {a mathematical formula}FPR with the input labelling {a mathematical formula}Lundec, i.e. it holds that {a mathematical formula}{(B,undec),(C,undec),(A1,undec),(A2,undec),(O,undec)}⊑{(B,in),(C,out),(A1,in),(A2,out),(O,out)}, {a mathematical formula}{(B,undec),(C,undec),(A1,undec),(A2,undec),(O,undec)}⊑{(B,in),(C,out),(A1,out),(A2,in),(O,undec)}. More generally, we define the notion of homogeneously equivalent argumentation multipoles, corresponding to equivalent multipoles that exhibit a sort of mutually regular behavior.

       Given two equivalent multipoles, a sufficient condition for their homogeneous equivalence is that each multipole is “internally homogeneous”, i.e. the labellings prescribed by the local function are related by set-inclusion in a regular way w.r.t. the commitment relation between the input labellings.

       Ideal semantics

       The transparency properties of ideal semantics mirror the discouraging decomposability properties analyzed in Section 4.4: the following example, inspired by Example 7, shows that ideal semantics is not transparent even w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}FSCC.

It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are ID-equivalent, since {a mathematical formula}FID prescribes for {a mathematical formula}M1 the labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A1,undec),(A2,undec)} and for {a mathematical formula}M2 the labelling {a mathematical formula}{(B1,undec),(B2,undec),(B3,undec)}. As a consequence, the replacement {a mathematical formula}R is ID-legitimate, and it is also easy to see that it is {a mathematical formula}FSCC-preserving. However, {a mathematical formula}R is not ID-safe, since the ideal labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF1 leaves all the arguments undec, while the ideal labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF2 is {a mathematical formula}{(B1,undec),(B2,undec),(B3,undec),(E1,out),(E2,in)}.

       The case of acyclic multipoles
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       It is well-known that an argumentation framework with an acyclic attack relation admits a unique complete labelling which is thus also grounded, preferred, ideal, stable and semi-stable. It is then interesting to specifically consider acyclic multipoles, and to investigate whether they benefit of specific properties as far as replaceability is concerned.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 37">
       A multipole {a mathematical formula}M=(AF,RINP,ROUTP), where {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), is acyclic if there is no sequence {a mathematical formula}A1,…,An of distinct arguments with {a mathematical formula}Ai∈Ar such that {a mathematical formula}n&gt;1, {a mathematical formula}(Ai,Ai+1)∈att for {a mathematical formula}1≤i&lt;n, and {a mathematical formula}(An,A1)∈att. Note that this definition does not prevent an acyclic multipole to contain self-attacking arguments, i.e. arguments attacking themselves.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The following proposition shows that the property of acyclic frameworks mentioned above can be extended to acyclic multipoles.

      <paragraph>
       The above result entails that all semantics considered in this paper, with the exception of semi-stable semantics, become strongly transparent in case replacements involve acyclic multipoles. Since admissible, complete, stable and grounded semantics are strongly transparent, it suffices to consider preferred and ideal semantics.

However, the replacement {a mathematical formula}R is not SST-safe, since there is a unique semi-stable labelling in {a mathematical formula}AF1, namely {a mathematical formula}{(E1,undec),(E2,out),(E3,in),(E4,out),(A1,undec),(A2,in)}, while {a mathematical formula}AF2 admits {a mathematical formula}{(E1,undec),(E2,out),(E3,in),(E4,out),(B1,undec),(B2,undec),(B3,in),(B4,out),(B5,undec)} and {a mathematical formula}{(E1,undec),(E2,undec),(E3,out),(E4,in),(B1,undec),(B2,undec),(B3,out),(B4,in),(B5,out)} as the two semi-stable labellings. For instance, argument {a mathematical formula}E4 is assigned the unique label out in {a mathematical formula}AF1 and the labels in and out in {a mathematical formula}AF2.

      Putting modularity at work
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      As modularity is a very useful and pervasive property, the notions and results introduced in this paper have an open-ended range of applications. In fact, they can be exploited in all contexts, either theoretical or practical, where a non-monolithic approach is appropriate, ranging from the management of dynamics in argumentation to the study of efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms. While an extensive discussion of related works with pointers to future research directions is given in Section 10, in this section we use, as sample case-studies, the tasks of summarization and translation of argumentation frameworks and develop in detail some relevant application examples.

       Summarizing argumentation frameworks
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In this subsection we illustrate an example of application of the notion of equivalence between argumentation multipoles for the purpose of summarization of argumentation frameworks. In particular we take from the literature two argument-based recontructions of the court's decision of the Popov v. Hayashi case and show that, in spite of many differences in the details, they can be reduced to a comparable basic structure through considerations based on multipole equivalence.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We borrow a synthetic description of the facts originating the case from [44]. “The case concerned the possession of the baseball which Barry Bonds hit for his record breaking 73rd home run in the 2001 season. Such a ball is very valuable (Mark McGwire's 1998 70th home run ball sold at auction for $3,000,000). When the ball was struck into the crowd, Popov caught it in the upper part of the webbing of his baseball glove. Such a catch, a snowcone catch because the ball is not fully in the mitt, does not give certainty of retaining control of the ball, particularly since Popov was stretching and may have fallen. However, Popov was not given the chance to complete his catch since, as it entered his glove, he was tackled and thrown to the ground by others trying to secure the ball, which became dislodged from his glove. Hayashi (himself innocent of the attack on Popov), then picked up the ball and put it in his pocket, so securing possession.”
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Popov then claimed possession of the ball and sued Hayashi. The court finally decided that the ball should be sold and the proceeds divided between the two.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The rather articulated motivations underlying the decision have attracted the attention of researchers and have been the subject of several papers, culminating in a special issue of the Artificial Intelligence and Law journal devoted to the modelling of this case [1]. In the following subsections we present the argument-based formalizations provided by Wyner and Bench-Capon [44] and by Prakken [39] respectively. Then we show how the notions and results presented in previous sections can be used to summarize the two formalizations and simplify their comparison.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For the sake of uniformity with the original formalizations, in the following we will sometimes refer to the extension-based rather than the labelling-based approach. In particular, an S extension (e.g. the grounded extension) is the set of arguments labelled in by an S labelling (e.g. the grounded labelling).

        The formalization by Wyner and Bench-Capon
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        In [44] the legal analysis of the case is synthesized by the argumentation framework presented in Fig. 19 (the paper also presents an analysis of the values underlying the final decision using the formalism of value-based argumentation frameworks, which is beyond the scope of the present paper). In the original figure of [44] the boxes representing arguments are labeled with an identifier Ax, where x is a number, while a few other boxes have no label and contain a statement corresponding to the conclusion of the argument. In Fig. 19 all arguments have both a label (on top of the box and corresponding to the original one where present) and a text synthesizing their conclusion. Each argument labeled as Ax derives from the application of a rule with some premises and a conclusion, while the other four arguments are intended to represent default answers to some questions: quoting [44], “if the argument is not defeated, the contrary has not been shown”. The conclusion of an argument may correspond to the undercut of some rule. An argument attacks another argument if the conclusion of the former contradicts the conclusion or some premise of the latter or undercuts the rule used for its construction. Default arguments can only attack another argument on its premises. Turning to a quick explanation of Fig. 19, we can proceed backwards starting from the mutually attacking arguments A1 and A2, concerning who has possession of the ball. A2 is undercut by A13: the rule that Hayashi has possession of the ball because he retrieved it is not applicable given that Popov was active in catching the ball before Hayashi retrieved it. A13 is attacked by the default argument P-na, which is in turn attacked by A11 based on factual evidence of the snowcone catch. A2 is also undercut by A3, whose premise (by the way, the same as of A1) is that Popov caught the ball before Hayashi. However both A1 and A3 are attacked by the default argument that the ball was not caught by Popov. This is in turn attacked by A4, based on the fact that the ball was in Popov's glove. A4 is undercut by A5 and A6, the former based on the fact that the ball was still in motion, the latter on the fact that Popov was not in control of the ball. Both A5 and A6 are undercut by A10 based on the fact that Popov was active. A10 is hence attacked by the default argument P-na and is also undercut by A12, based on the custom and practice of the stands in baseball. Moreover A5 is attacked by the default argument P-ic, which is attacked by A7 based on the fact that Popov did not retain the ball in the glove. A7 is undercut by A8, based on the fact that Popov lost the ball due to an intentional contact of other people. Finally, A8 is attacked by the default argument CI which is in turn attacked by A9 based on factual evidence that Popov was assaulted.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        It can be seen that for the argumentation framework represented in Fig. 19 the grounded extension is also the only complete, stable, semi-stable, ideal and preferred extension. It consists of the arguments A9, A11, A12, A13, A6, A8, P-ic, P-nc, which are evidenced in grey in Fig. 20. We note that both A1 and A2 are rejected according to any semantics, leaving the issue of the possession of the ball unresolved.

        The formalization by Prakken
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        The reconstruction of the case given in [39] adopts ASPIC+, which is essentially a rule-based formalism for the construction of arguments and the identification of their subargument and attack relations. It is worth remarking that the latter takes into account the former: if an argument attacks another argument then it attacks also all its superarguments. In ASPIC+ argument status evaluation follows Dung's approach: an argumentation framework consisting only of the arguments and their attack relations can be derived and then the semantics deemed most appropriate can be applied.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Coming back to Popov and Hayashi, the reconstruction of [39] covers a lot of details concerning argument construction and, as such, is much more articulated than the one of [44] as shown by Fig. 21, Fig. 22 which correspond to the aggregation of five distinct but linked figures included in [39]. Direct subargument relationships are represented by dashed lines ending with a solid dot on the superargument, attack relationships are represented by solid arrows ending on the attacked argument. The text in an argument box essentially gives an idea on its conclusion. Fig. 21 is referred to as the upper part, while Fig. 22 is referred to as the lower part, they are linked only by two subargument relations: VR-MC8 and VR-r1 in Fig. 22 are direct subarguments respectively of EQ and H-hr in Fig. 21.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        For a detailed description of the whole reconstruction, which is clearly beyond the scope of the present paper, the reader is referred to [39]. At a general level we can observe that:
       </paragraph>
       <list>
        <list-item label="•">
         a lot of attention is reserved to issues concerning the validity of rules (sometimes based in turn on the validity of other rules), their adoption and their applicability to the case into question;
        </list-item>
        <list-item label="•">
         the lower part (Fig. 22) essentially concerns the question whether Popov gained possession of the ball. There are two alternative reasoning lines leading to this conclusion, composed respectively by arguments VR-cs4, P-cc(1), P-ca(1), P-ph(1), P-hp(1), and P-wit, P-cb, VR-cs2, P-cc(2), P-ca(2), P-ph(2), P-hp(2). Both lines are defeated, the former by argument NV-cs4 stating the invalidity of the rule cs4 which is the starting point of the whole line, the latter by argument P-inc stating that Popov's testimony, on which the whole line is based, is not credible.
        </list-item>
        <list-item label="•">
         the upper part (Fig. 21) essentially concerns the action to be taken: three mutually exclusive alternatives (corresponding to the three mutually attacking arguments H-hr, H-nr, and EQ) are considered: Hayashi has to return the ball, Hayashi has not to return the ball, the ball is equally shared. Each of the three arguments is derived through a quite articulated reasoning line. Both H-hr and H-nr are defeated, the former by argument NV-rp, stating that the rule rp is not valid, the latter by argument NA-r4, stating that the rule r4 is not applicable.
        </list-item>
       </list>
       <paragraph>
        If one considers the attack relations only (i.e. focuses on the argumentation framework to be used for argument status evaluation) the picture is simplified, as shown in Fig. 23, since a large number of arguments are neither attacking nor attacked by others. It can be seen that for the argumentation framework represented in Fig. 23 the grounded extension is also the only complete, stable, semi-stable, ideal and preferred extension and consists of the arguments evidenced in grey. We note that of the three arguments corresponding to the possible final decisions both H-hr and H-nr are rejected, while EQ is accepted.

        Summarizing and comparing the two formalizations
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        We can now use considerations based on the equivalence properties examined in the previous sections to identify some fundamental similarities between the two reconstructions of the case.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        As to the argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AFJ=(Ar,att) of Fig. 19, let us start by considering the argumentation multipole {a mathematical formula}M1=(AFJ↓{A11, P-na},∅,{(P-na, A10),(P-na, A13)}) with respect to {a mathematical formula}E1=Ar∖{A11, P-na}. It is rather easy to see that for any labeling {a mathematical formula}LE1 of {a mathematical formula}E1 (actually irrelevant since the multipole does not receive attacks) and for any semantics S (all behave the same on such a simple subframework) it holds that {a mathematical formula}S-effE1(M1,LE1)={(A,in)|A∈E1}=S-effE1(M∅,LE1).
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        In other words, the multipole {a mathematical formula}M1 is S-equivalent to the empty multipole for any semantics S. It follows that the replacement {a mathematical formula}R=(AFJ,M1,M∅) is S-legitimate. Intuitively this means that the arguments A11 and {a mathematical formula}P−na can be canceled from {a mathematical formula}AFJ without any consequence on the evaluation of other arguments, provided that a suitable transparency property holds for S. Since both multipoles {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M∅ are acyclic, the results summarized in Table 2 ensure that the replacement is safe for any semantics considered in this paper except semi-stable semantics (by the way, the replacement is safe also for semi-stable semantics, given that in this case its labellings coincide with stable labellings).
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Iterating the same kind of reasoning, it can be seen that the following pairs of arguments can progressively (and safely) be cancelled: {a mathematical formula}{A12, A10}, {a mathematical formula}{A9, CI}, {a mathematical formula}{A8, A7}, {a mathematical formula}{P-ic, A5}, {a mathematical formula}{A6, A4}. In virtue of Proposition 13 we have that we can safely restrict {a mathematical formula}AFJ to the set of arguments {a mathematical formula}E⁎={A1, A2, A3, A13, P-nc} without affecting the labellings of the arguments in {a mathematical formula}E⁎. This could have been done (in a single, more laborious, step) also showing that the big multipole consisting of the set of arguments {a mathematical formula}{A11, P-na, A12, A10, A9, CI, A8, A7, P-ic, A5, A6, A4} is S-equivalent to the empty multipole.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Assuming that the main focus concerns the evaluation of arguments A1 and A2, we can also see that A3 can be suppressed in {a mathematical formula}AFJ⁎=AFJ↓E⁎: given the multipole {a mathematical formula}M2=(AFJ⁎↓{A3, P-nc},∅,{(P-nc, A1),(A3, A2)}) with respect to {a mathematical formula}E2={A1, A2, A13}, it is again easy to see that for any (actually irrelevant) labelling {a mathematical formula}LE2 of {a mathematical formula}E2 and for any semantics S it holds that {a mathematical formula}S-effE2(M2,LE2)={(A1,out),(A2,in),(A13,in)}=S-effE2(M3,LE2) where {a mathematical formula}M3≜(({P-nc},∅),∅,{(P-nc, A1)}). Using again the fact that both {a mathematical formula}M2 and {a mathematical formula}M3 are acyclic we get that the replacement is safe, i.e. that A3 can be cancelled.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Summing up, we get the simplified argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AFJ− shown in Fig. 24 which, for any semantics considered in this paper, is equivalent to the original one as far as the evaluation of the remaining arguments is concerned.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Turning now to the argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AFK of Fig. 23, we first note that all the isolated (i.e. both unattacking and unattacked) arguments can be suppressed. This follows from the fact that, for any semantics S and for any argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AFU such that {a mathematical formula}LS(AFU)≠∅, given the multipole {a mathematical formula}MU=(AFU,∅,∅) with respect to any (actually irrelevant) set E, for any labeling {a mathematical formula}LE of E it holds that {a mathematical formula}S-effE(MU,LE)={(A,in)|A∈E}=S-effE1(M∅,LE).
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Supposing that the main interest concerns the final decision, i.e. the evaluation of the arguments H-hr, H-nr and EQ, and using the same reasoning as above we can also see that all the arguments concerning the issue of Popov's possession, not attacking nor being attacked by arguments outside the set, can be suppressed.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Then, using a reasoning which is completely analogous to the one applied to the multipole {a mathematical formula}M2 above, we can also suppress the arguments H-hp, P-nhp, and Vr-rp, getting finally the argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AFK− represented in Fig. 25.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Comparing now Fig. 24, Fig. 25 we observe that:
       </paragraph>
       <list>
        <list-item label="•">
         arguments A1 and A2 in {a mathematical formula}AFJ− correspond respectively to arguments H-hr and H-nr in {a mathematical formula}AFK− and have the same status of rejected;
        </list-item>
        <list-item label="•">
         similarly, we can also say that arguments P-nc and A13 in {a mathematical formula}AFJ− correspond respectively to arguments NV-rp and NA-r4 in {a mathematical formula}AFK−;
        </list-item>
        <list-item label="•">
         the argument EQ of {a mathematical formula}AFK− has no counterpart in {a mathematical formula}AFJ− due to the fact that in [44] the final decision is represented only in the context of the value-based formalization.
        </list-item>
       </list>
       <paragraph>
        Leaving apart EQ, we note therefore a basic structural similarity between the two simplified frameworks: in both reconstructions the arguments corresponding to giving the ball to one of the contendants are rejected due to one main reason. One may then wonder whether the reasons for these rejections are actually the same in the two reconstructions.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        As to the rejection of the decision in favor of Hayashi, in {a mathematical formula}AFJ− it is due to the undercut of A2 by A13, which is based on the fact that Popov was “ably and actively engaged in establishing control” of the ball. Similarly, in {a mathematical formula}AFK− the rejection of H-nr is due to the fact that a rule used to derive that Hayashi has possession of the ball, is shown not to be applicable in this case through argument NA-r4, based on the fact that the ball was not loose (due to the previous attempt of Popov) when Hayashi retrieved it.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        While basically similar as far as the previous point is concerned, the two reconstructions turn out to be different as to the rejection of the decision in favor of Popov: in {a mathematical formula}AFJ− A1 is attacked by P-nc which corresponds to the conclusion that Popov did not catch the ball, thus denying the premise of A1, while in {a mathematical formula}AFK− H-hr is attacked by NV-rp, which concerns the validity of the rule rp. It is interesting to note that in [39] the argument NV-rp is essentially based on the fact that “rule rp does not promote fundamental fairness as regards Popov's claim” and that, indeed, fairness is the primary value considered in the value-based part of [44] as a justification of the final decision.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Thus the difference arises from the fact that in the formalism adopted in [39] reasoning about values is embedded into arguments that are at the same level as other arguments, while in [44] reasoning about values is carried out in a separate layer. A discussion about the pros and cons of either approach to deal with values is clearly out of the scope of this paper.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        To conclude this section we remark that the identification of some basic commonalities and differences between two argument-based reconstructions of a real law case has been greatly simplified by the possibility to summarize frameworks in a general and technically sound way. In this perspective the notion of argumentation multipole and the decomposability and equivalence properties investigated in this paper can be regarded as enabling techniques for the investigation of methods for (possibly automated) analysis, synthesis and comparison of argumentation frameworks.

       Translations of argumentation frameworks
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Translating an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF1 into another framework {a mathematical formula}AF2 such that {a mathematical formula}AF2 has some desirable features and, at the same time, preserves some specific properties of {a mathematical formula}AF1 is a generic problem with significant theoretical and practical implications. In particular in [27] the problem of intertraslatability is considered, which is defined as follows: “Given an argumentation framework F and argumentation semantics σ and {a mathematical formula}σ′, find a function Tr such that the σ-extensions of F are in certain correspondence to the {a mathematical formula}σ′-extensions of {a mathematical formula}Tr(F).” As a matter of fact, in [27]modularity is one of the general requirements of a translation procedure, informally stated as “the translation can be done independently for certain parts of the framework”. While this generic notion may have different technical counterparts depending on the kind of translation addressed, our results provide a systematic and sound basis for ensuring modularity in any context where there is an interest in replacing a subframework with a translated counterpart. A broad investigation of this issue is clearly a matter for future work, here we provide two specific examples taken from the literature: the former concerns a subframework replacement considered in the context of the analysis of the properties of weighted argument systems, while the latter concerns the translation (also called flattening) of argumentation frameworks with attacks to attacks into “traditional” Dung's frameworks.
      </paragraph>
      <section label="9.2.1">
       <section-title>
        Reducing the attacks involving single arguments under grounded semantics
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        A weighted argument system (WAS in the following), as defined in [26], is basically an argumentation framework with a numerical weight (actually a non-negative real number) attached to each attack. In the analysis of the computational properties of WASs, it turns out to be convenient to consider a translation from a WAS into another one such that no argument attacks or is attacked by more than 2 arguments and some conditions are satisfied. Leaving apart the aspects of the translation and the conditions involving weights, which are not relevant to the present paper, basically the translation described in [26] involves replacing the subframework consisting of an argument z receiving more than two attacks (from arguments {a mathematical formula}y1,…,yk) with a subframework with additional arguments {a mathematical formula}p1 and {a mathematical formula}q1 where z receives only two attacks (from {a mathematical formula}p1 and {a mathematical formula}y1), while {a mathematical formula}p1 is attacked by {a mathematical formula}q1 and {a mathematical formula}q1 is attacked by the arguments {a mathematical formula}y2,…,yk (see Fig. 26). The replacement can then be iterated focusing on {a mathematical formula}q1 and adding {a mathematical formula}p2 and {a mathematical formula}q2 until {a mathematical formula}qk−2 is only attacked by {a mathematical formula}yk−1 and {a mathematical formula}yk. The claim (proved in [26] as part of Lemma 1) is that the grounded extension of the original framework is the same as the grounded extension of the framework resulting from the replacements mentioned above. Note that Lemma 1 of [26] concerns an arbitrary WAS, i.e. its hypotheses do not put any restriction on other attacks present in the original framework. In particular, as explicitly remarked in [26], there can be attacks between some of the attackers of z, but also (not explicitly remarked in [26]) z might counterattack some of its attackers or there could be longer loops involving z, some of its attackers and possibly other arguments in the framework.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Given these remarks, the proof of Lemma 1 provided in [26] is not completely satisfactory: it consists in local considerations on the arguments involved in the replacement described above without dealing with possible effects involving other arguments in the framework. The absence of these effects, however, cannot be taken for granted. To give an example, when considering (to contradiction) a generic argument x included in the grounded extension of the original framework but not in the grounded extension of the translated framework it is stated that this implies that there is an attacker u of x in the translated framework such that {a mathematical formula}(u,x) was not an attack in the original framework. This immediately leads to identify x as z and u as {a mathematical formula}p1 and to apply only local considerations. However, in general, an argument might be excluded from the grounded extension not just because it has an additional attacker but also because one of its attackers has a different justification state in the new framework. In a sense, the proof of Lemma 1 of [26] seems to implicitly assume the property of transparency of grounded semantics (which, of course is not obvious per se) and (partially) shows a sort of local equivalence of the original fragment and of its translated counterpart.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Actually, the result of Lemma 1 of [26] is valid and this can be shown in a relatively straightforward way using the results of the present paper. First, given that grounded semantics is strongly transparent, to obtain the result it is sufficient to show that the translation step depicted in Fig. 26 involves the replacement of an argumentation multipole with another one which is Input/Output GR-equivalent. The fact that the translation may involve several such steps is then covered by the result of Proposition 13.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        As to the identification of the equivalent multipoles {a mathematical formula}M1=(AF1,RINP1,ROUTP1) and {a mathematical formula}M2=(AF2,RINP2,ROUTP2), observe that the basic idea consists in replacing the argument z with the attack chain composed by the three arguments {a mathematical formula}p1, {a mathematical formula}q1, and z itself within an arbitrary argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att) where {a mathematical formula}{y1,…,yk} is the set of attackers of z with {a mathematical formula}k&gt;2. Then {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are defined with respect to the same invariant set {a mathematical formula}E=Ar∖{z}, and the relevant frameworks are {a mathematical formula}AF1=({z},∅) and {a mathematical formula}AF2=({p1,q1,z},{(q1,p1),(p1,z)}). Moreover {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 have the same output relation: {a mathematical formula}ROUTP1=ROUTP2=att∩({z}×Ar), while they differ in the input relation: {a mathematical formula}RINP1={(yi,z)|1≤i≤k}; {a mathematical formula}RINP2={(y1,z)}∪{(yi,q1)|2≤i≤k}. We have now to show that {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are GR-equivalent, i.e. that for any labelling {a mathematical formula}LE∈LE, {a mathematical formula}GR-effE(M1,LE)=GR-effE(M2,LE), which, recalling Definition 29, amounts to show that {a mathematical formula}{effE(M1outp,L↓M1outp,ROUTP1)|L∈FGR(AF1,M1inp,LE↓M1inp,RINP1)}={effE(M2outp,L↓M2outp,ROUTP2)|L∈FGR(AF2,M2inp,LE↓M2inp,RINP2)}.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        First note that, since {a mathematical formula}M1outp=M2outp={z} and {a mathematical formula}ROUTP1=ROUTP2, both {a mathematical formula}effE(M1outp,L↓M1outp,ROUTP1) and {a mathematical formula}effE(M2outp,L↓M2outp,ROUTP2) are totally determined by the label assigned to z by {a mathematical formula}FGR given the labelling of the arguments in the input set {a mathematical formula}{y1,…,yk} (which is the same for both multipoles).
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Now it is easy to see that the label assigned to z is the same for any labelling of the arguments {a mathematical formula}{y1,…,yk} considering three basic cases: i) {a mathematical formula}∃yi∈{y1,…,yk}:Lab(yi)=in; ii) {a mathematical formula}∀yi∈{y1,…,yk}:Lab(yi)=out; iii) {a mathematical formula}∄yi∈{y1,…,yk}:Lab(yi)=in∧∃yi∈{y1,…,yk}:Lab(yi)=undec.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        In the case i), clearly z is assigned the label out by {a mathematical formula}FGR in {a mathematical formula}M1 and this also holds in {a mathematical formula}M2 since either z is attacked directly by an argument labelled in (if {a mathematical formula}Lab(y1)=in) or, if this is not the case, necessarily {a mathematical formula}∃yi∈{y2,…,yk}:Lab(yi)=in and then {a mathematical formula}Lab(q1)=out, {a mathematical formula}Lab(p1)=in, {a mathematical formula}Lab(z)=out.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        In the case ii), clearly z is assigned the label in by {a mathematical formula}FGR in {a mathematical formula}M1 and this also holds in {a mathematical formula}M2: given {a mathematical formula}∀yi∈{y1,…,yk}:Lab(yi)=out it follows {a mathematical formula}Lab(q1)=in, {a mathematical formula}Lab(p1)=out and then both attackers ({a mathematical formula}y1 and {a mathematical formula}p1) of z are labelled out and z is labelled in.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        In the case iii), clearly z is assigned the label undec by {a mathematical formula}FGR in {a mathematical formula}M1. As to {a mathematical formula}M2, first note that {a mathematical formula}y1 is either labelled undec or out (in the latter case necessarily {a mathematical formula}∃yi∈{y2,…,yk}:Lab(yi)=undec). Moreover, {a mathematical formula}q1 is either labelled in or undec and consequently {a mathematical formula}p1 is labelled out or undec (both are necessarily undec if {a mathematical formula}Lab(y1)=out). Summing up, z is either attacked by two arguments labelled undec or by one labelled undec and one labelled out and hence is labelled undec by {a mathematical formula}FGR, as required.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        A similar reasoning applies to the case where an argument attacks more than two other arguments, using the replacement sketched in Fig. 27.

        Flattening attacks to attacks
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        In recent years several extensions of Dung's framework encompassing attacks to attacks have been considered, like the EAF (Extended Argumentation Framework) formalism [35], mainly designed for the purpose of preference modelling, and the more general (as, differently from EAF, they allow unlimited recursion of attacks on attacks) AFRA (Argumentation Framework with Recursive Attacks) [4], [5] and HLAF (Higher Level Argumentation Framework) [29].
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        For the sake of keeping the example compact, we focus here on the EAF formalism whose definition (taken from [35]) is given below.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Definition 38">
        An Extended Argumentation Framework (EAF) is a tuple {a mathematical formula}(Args,R,D) such that Args is a set of arguments and:

        </list-item>
       </list>
       <paragraph>
        As typical in any kind of extension of Dung's framework, there is an interest in defining a translation procedure from the extended formalism to the basic one. This is useful for several purposes, including the opportunity to reuse or adapt, in the extended context, the large corpus of theoretical results available in Dung's framework, in particular as far as computational complexity is concerned.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        In the case of attacks to attacks, as to our knowledge, two main translation procedures have been proposed in the literature. The first procedure (considered with some slight variants in [36], [29], [18]) involves replacing an attacked attack with an attack chain consisting in two additional arguments, then every attack towards the replaced attack becomes an attack towards the second additional argument. The second procedure (considered in [4], [5]) involves replacing an attack with a single new argument, with a proper rearrangement of the incoming and outcoming attacks involving it. We present in the following the formal definition of these procedures tailored to the case of EAF.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Definition 39">
        Let {a mathematical formula}Γ=(Args,R,D) be an EAF and let us define {a mathematical formula}D→(Γ)={(A,B)|D∩(Args×{(A,B)})≠∅} i.e. the set of attacks receiving at least an attack according to the relation {a mathematical formula}D.
       </paragraph>
       <list>
        <list-item label="•">
         The chain-style flattening of Γ is the argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AFcΓ=(Argsc,attc) where {a mathematical formula}Argsc=Args∪{XA,B,YA,B|(A,B)∈D→(Γ)} and {a mathematical formula}attc=R∪{(A,XA,B),(XA,B,YA,B),(YA,B,B)|(A,B)∈D→(Γ)}∪{(C,YA,B)|(C,(A,B))∈D}
        </list-item>
        <list-item label="•">
         The single-argument flattening of Γ is the argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AFsaΓ=(Argssa,attsa) where {a mathematical formula}Argssa=Args∪{AB¯|(A,B)∈D→(Γ)} and {a mathematical formula}attsa=(R∖{(A,B)|(A,B)∈D→(Γ)})∪{(AB¯,B)|(A,B)∈D→(Γ)}∪{(D,AB¯)|(A,B)∈D→(Γ)∧(D,A)∈R}∪{(C,AB¯)|(C,(A,B))∈D}.
        </list-item>
       </list>
       <paragraph>
        In words, in chain-style flattening two arguments {a mathematical formula}XA,B and {a mathematical formula}YA,B are added in replacement of every attacked attack {a mathematical formula}(A,B) (with {a mathematical formula}A,XA,B,YA,B,B forming an attack chain) and the arguments attacking {a mathematical formula}(A,B) according to the relation {a mathematical formula}D of Γ attack {a mathematical formula}YA,B in {a mathematical formula}AFc (while the attacks between arguments in {a mathematical formula}R remain the same). In single-argument flattening every attacked attack {a mathematical formula}(A,B) is replaced by a single argument {a mathematical formula}AB¯ which attacks B (instead of A) and is attacked by all attackers of A in {a mathematical formula}R and by all attackers of {a mathematical formula}(A,B) in {a mathematical formula}D.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        The two translation procedures are illustrated in Fig. 28.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Of course one may wonder whether the operational differences in the two flattening procedures give rise to any actual difference in the final outcome (i.e. in the justification status of the arguments originally included in Γ) or, indeed, the two flattened frameworks treat the arguments originally included in Γ in the same way, showing that the two procedures, different as they are, basically capture the same intuition.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        To answer this question first observe that, given an EAF {a mathematical formula}Γ=(Args,R,D), both the argumentation frameworks {a mathematical formula}AFcΓ and {a mathematical formula}AFsaΓ include all the original arguments Args and that they locally differ in correspondence of the additional arguments used to represent the elements of {a mathematical formula}D→(Γ). So {a mathematical formula}AFsaΓ can be obtained from {a mathematical formula}AFcΓ (and vice versa) through the replacements of a (possibly quite articulated) multipole {a mathematical formula}Mc with another multipole {a mathematical formula}Msa, both referring to the same set of invariant arguments Args. Thus, answering the question amounts to analyzing the safeness of this replacement, based in turn on the equivalence between these multipoles.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        First, observe that the multipoles {a mathematical formula}Mc and {a mathematical formula}Msa consist of the union of {a mathematical formula}|D→(Γ)| disjoint and non-interacting “submultipoles” each having the form illustrated in Fig. 28. In virtue of Proposition 13, we can then consider a sequence of (similar) replacements leading from {a mathematical formula}AFsaΓ to {a mathematical formula}AFcΓ and, to ensure that the whole sequence of replacements is safe (as far as the arguments Args are concerned), it is sufficient to show that each single step is safe, i.e. to analyze equivalence between the two multipoles representing the translation of a single attack to attack.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        To this purpose, referring again to Fig. 28, we can identify the multipoles {a mathematical formula}Mc=(AFc,RINPc,ROUTPc) with {a mathematical formula}AFc=({XA,B,YA,B},(XA,B,YA,B)), {a mathematical formula}RINPc={(A,XA,B)}∪{(C1,YA,B),…,(Cn,YA,B)}, {a mathematical formula}ROUTPc={(YA,B,B)}, and {a mathematical formula}Msa=(AFsa,RINPsa,ROUTPsa) with {a mathematical formula}AFsa=({AB¯},∅), {a mathematical formula}RINPsa={(D1,AB¯),…,(Dm,AB¯)}∪{(C1,AB¯),…,(Cn,AB¯)}, and {a mathematical formula}ROUTPsa={(AB¯,B)}.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        It is immediate to observe that the replacement of {a mathematical formula}Mc with {a mathematical formula}Msa (or vice versa) is in general not legitimate: for instance, {a mathematical formula}Mc and {a mathematical formula}Msa are in general not equivalent if one considers a labelling Lab such that {a mathematical formula}Lab(D1)=in and {a mathematical formula}Lab(A)=in. However, this labelling is clearly illegal in a context where {a mathematical formula}D1 attacks A. More generally, the labels of arguments {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dm completely determine the label of A, thus one may check whether the replacement is contextually legitimate. So, for any semantics S, we are interested in showing that {a mathematical formula}Mc and {a mathematical formula}Msa are S-equivalent with respect to {a mathematical formula}LRS≜{FS(AF↓Args,Mcoutp,Lc,ROUTPc)|Lc∈LMcoutp}∪{FS(AF↓Args,Msaoutp,Lsa,ROUTPsa)|Lsa∈LMsaoutp}.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Observe that since the output relation of both {a mathematical formula}Mc and {a mathematical formula}Msa consists of a single attack (arising from {a mathematical formula}YA,B and {a mathematical formula}AB¯ respectively) the two multipoles are equivalent if and only if the labels assigned to {a mathematical formula}YA,B and {a mathematical formula}AB¯ are the same for any labelling in {a mathematical formula}LRS. Moreover, we focus on CO-equivalence of multipoles without loss of generality: in fact, it turns out (and it is easy to see) that, in any case, for both {a mathematical formula}AFc and {a mathematical formula}AFsa, the local function of complete semantics prescribes exactly one complete labelling, which implies that this is the only labelling also for all the other complete-compatible semantics considered in this paper.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        A remark is now in order concerning the labellings of the arguments outside the multipoles, i.e. {a mathematical formula}LRCO (note that {a mathematical formula}LRCO⊇LRS for any complete-compatible semantics S considered in this paper). As we are interested in proving an equivalence result whatever the remaining part of the framework is (in addition to the arguments depicted in Fig. 28), the set of labellings {a mathematical formula}LRCO cannot be precisely characterized as it also depends on the (unspecified) remaining part of the framework. As a consequence, we prove a slightly stronger result, considering any labelling in the set {a mathematical formula}LRCO¯ consisting of the labellings compatible with the attacks from the arguments {a mathematical formula}Di to the argument A. Since {a mathematical formula}LRCO¯⊇LRCO this implies the desired equivalence result.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Now, the examination of labellings in {a mathematical formula}LRCO¯ can be carried out considering nine cases, i.e., all possible combination, for the sets {a mathematical formula}{D1,…,Dm} and {a mathematical formula}{C1,…,Cn}, of three basic cases: i) there is an argument labelled in; ii) all arguments are labelled out; iii) otherwise (note in particular that {a mathematical formula}Lab(A) is determined by the labelling of the set {a mathematical formula}{D1,…,Dm} in both multipoles). As all cases are rather simple, for the sake of compactness we synthesize the analysis in Table 3 rather than providing trivial and verbose explanations: by inspection of the last two columns it appears that {a mathematical formula}Lab(YA,B)=Lab(AB¯) in all cases, as desired.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        We have thus proved that the replacement of the considered multipoles is contextually S-legitimate for any complete-compatible semantics S considered in this paper. Then, the replacement is safe for any such semantics S which is strongly transparent with respect to these multipoles. Given that the multipoles are acyclic, from the results recalled in Table 2 it follows that the replacement is guaranteed to be safe for all semantics considered in this paper, but SST, for which the answer is negative in general and the question is open for this specific case.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        The lesson learned is twofold: first, we have given a substantial formal confirmation of the intuition that the two translation procedures are equivalent as far as the “external effects” are concerned for a comprehensive set of semantics, second we have seen however that even “simple” and basically correct intuitions require a careful semantics-specific scrutiny which may point out specific exceptions or critical issues (like for semi-stable semantics in our case).

       Local evaluation in argumentation semantics
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       As to our knowledge the first analyses of semantics' properties exploitable for the purpose of local evaluation in the literature are provided by the work on SCC-recursiveness [10] and the notion of directionality introduced in [8].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Starting from the latter, in a nutshell a semantics is directional when it is guaranteed that, as far as extensions are concerned, a part of the framework which does not receive attacks from the rest of the framework is unaffected by the rest of the framework itself. Letting U be a set of arguments not receiving attacks from arguments not in U, this means that the same results (i.e. the same set of local extensions) are obtained either by computing the global extensions and then intersecting them with U, or by directly computing the extensions of the restricted framework consisting of the arguments in U and of the attacks among them.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Directionality allows for local computation when the results one is interested in can be obtained by focusing on an unattacked set, but has no embedded notion of progressive construction: it simply prescribes a relation of inclusion between the local extensions and the global ones. As such it is poorly related with the properties of semantics decomposability and transparency. To give some examples, stable semantics, which is not directional, is fully decomposable (and hence strongly transparent) while semi-stable semantics (which is non directional too) lacks any form of decomposability and transparency. Admissible and complete semantics are directional, fully decomposable and strongly transparent, while ideal semantics (which is directional too) lacks any form of decomposability and satisfies only a very weak form of transparency. To complete the picture, recall that grounded and preferred semantics (which feature intermediate properties) are directional too.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The notion of SCC-recursiveness has closer relationships with the present work, as already evidenced by the fact that we considered partition selectors based on the notion of SCC. Basically, the SCC-recursive scheme provides a general method to build the global extensions prescribed by a semantics by proceeding progressively following the (partial) order among SCCs induced by the attack relation (recall that the graph obtained by considering each SCC as a single node is acyclic). The SCC-recursive scheme applies to each SCC a semantics-specific base function and then prescribes how to “propagate the effects” of the choices made in the previous SCCs to the subsequent ones before applying in turn the base function to them. As such, SCC-recursiveness directly implies the property of semantics decomposability with respect to the selector {a mathematical formula}FSCC.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Five of the semantics we have considered in this paper are SCC-recursive (namely admissible, complete, stable, grounded, and preferred semantics), and indeed we have proved that all of them feature stronger decomposability properties than the one implied by SCC-recursiveness. Moreover, the notion of local function introduced in this paper can be seen as a generalization of the notion of base function in the SCC-recursive scheme.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Drawing a more detailed analysis of the relationships of SCC-recursiveness with decomposability and transparency properties is an interesting line of future work. As a first note in this direction, we can observe that the two semantics lacking SCC-recursiveness considered in this paper (namely semi-stable and ideal semantics) lack also any decomposability property.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In [40] the problem of combining local evaluations is addressed in a multi-agent scenario context where each agent owns a part of the framework and may locally adopt a different semantics. This gives rise to the notion of multi-sorted argumentation framework where a global argumentation framework is regarded as composed of a set of interacting cells, each associated with a (possibly) different semantics. In this context, the investigation in [40] follows a sort of top-down approach: given a (global) set of arguments S, it addresses the problem of checking whether S is an extension of the multi-sorted framework, according to local evaluations carried out for each cell. Basically, the definition of local evaluation at the cell level, directly reuses notions taken from the SCC-recursive scheme, as explicitly stated in [40]: the acceptance functions used at the cell level (Definition 5 in [40]) correspond to the base functions of the SCC-recursive scheme, while the notions of subframework and qualified arguments of a subframework (Definitions 7 and 8 in [40]) also have a direct correspondence with key technical elements of the SCC-recursive scheme (respectively with {a mathematical formula}AF↓UPAF(S,E) and {a mathematical formula}UAF(S,E) in Definition 20 of [10]). Thus, in a sense, the work of [40] reuses some of the main notions of the SCC-recursive scheme by applying them into two important directions of generalization: considering arbitrary (rather than SCC-based) partitions of the framework and allowing heterogeneous local evaluations. However, the direct reuse of notions specifically conceived in the context of the SCC-recursive scheme limits the possibility to fully encompass situations of mutual interaction and cyclic dependence between cells, which are impossible in the case of SCCs but are possible with arbitrary partitions. The present work addresses the study of homogeneous local evaluations for arbitrary partitions of an argumentation framework by introducing novel notions to capture the more complex interactions between subframeworks arising in this context. Extending the results presented in this paper to the case of heterogeneous local evaluations is an important direction of future work.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It has also to be mentioned that some results concerning the use of the same semantics (or of semantics with common properties) in all cells are provided in [40] (in particular the notion of Uniform Case Extension Equivalence in Definition 10 of [40] roughly corresponds to our notion of semantics decomposability). These results are not directly comparable with ours, due to the different modeling of the interactions between subframeworks mentioned previously. For instance, in Example 5 of [40] a counterexample is given disproving (a sort of) top-down decomposability of grounded semantics in multi-sorted frameworks, while in our context grounded semantics is actually top-down decomposable.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In the notion of conditional acceptance function introduced in [19], basically the acceptance function, corresponding to a given semantics, accepts as input not only an argumentation framework but also an (externally imposed) condition, which corresponds to the set of possible labellings of the framework. In other words, the acceptance function is constrained to produce a set of labellings which is a subset of the given condition. This expresses some form of external influence on argument evaluation, and in this sense could be related to our notion of argumentation framework with input. However, it is based on a rather different intuition, since it expresses a constraint on the labels of all arguments, independently of any attack relation coming from outside, while in our approach external influences manifest themselves through attack relations involving a well-identified set of arguments in the conditioned framework. In [19] the generic notion of conditional acceptance function is instantiated only for complete semantics, while its application to other semantics is, as to our knowledge, still to be developed.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs) [20] generalize Dung's framework by detaching the meaning of attack from the binary relation between arguments, so that each element of this relation is just a link representing a dependency. The meaning of the dependencies for each argument s is then expressed by an acceptance condition {a mathematical formula}Cs which associates each subset of the set of parents of s with either in or out, namely gives a binary decision on the acceptance of s given the set of its parents which are accepted. Hence, in ADFs argument evaluation is, by definition, based on a strictly local criterion and any global evaluation arises bottom-up from the combination of the local ones.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       While the present work is strictly focused on Dung's framework and the relevant semantics based on the attack relation, it appears that the basic ideas underlying our analysis have significant commonalities with the process of bottom-up evaluation in ADFs. Generalizing the results we have obtained to the context of ADFs is therefore a very important direction of future work.

       Argumentation dynamics
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Broadly speaking, in the context of abstract argumentation, dynamics concerns the evolution of a given framework to which one or more modifications (i.e. additions and/or deletions of arguments and/or attacks) are applied. These modifications can be exogenous and neutral, namely determined by some external event, or endogenous and goal-oriented, namely deliberately induced by an agent to reach some goal, like the acceptance of a desired argument. In the former case, the main interest is in determining the effect of the external modifications, in the latter, in identifying the minimal set of modifications sufficient to reach the goal. In both cases, one is typically interested in reusing as far as possible the results of previous computations carried out in the original framework so as to limit the amount of new computation required by the modification. Hence some of the pre-existing computation results have to be combined with the results of some partial computations in the new framework. Clearly the results presented in this paper are specifically related to this facet of argumentation dynamics and we focus on the relevant literature. A detailed analysis of the broader implications of our work on argumentation dynamics is beyond the scope of the present paper.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In [33] to save computation in a dynamic context the division-based method is proposed. Essentially, after a modification, the considered framework is divided into two parts, one unaffected and one affected. Briefly, the affected part consists of those arguments which are reachable (through a directed path of attacks) starting from any argument or attack involved in the modification. The identification of the unaffected part relies on the directionality property, which is required for the application of the method. To formalize the influence of the unaffected part over the affected part, the notion of conditioned argumentation framework is introduced, namely an argumentation framework receiving some attacks from arguments included in another argumentation framework. The paper then deals with incremental computation for some semantics satisfying the directionality property, namely complete, grounded, preferred and ideal{sup:14} semantics. After the modification, one needs to recompute the extensions only for the affected part (modeled as a conditioned argumentation framework w.r.t. the unaffected part).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Some basic notions underlying the division-based method are related to our work. In particular, the notion of conditioned argumentation framework in [33] is similar to the notions of conditioning relation and of argumentation framework with input in our Definition 10, Definition 11. Moreover, the incremental computation in a conditioned framework is analogous to the application of the local function introduced in Definition 11.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       There is however an important difference due to the fact that the division-based method is essentially based on the directionality principle and, in particular, requires that there are no paths from the affected part to the unaffected part. As a consequence, the division-based method covers the cases where a framework is partitioned into two subframeworks such that one has an output, without having an input, and the other has an input (from the former) without having an output. The results concerning incremental computation of the four semantics considered in [33] correspond to a restricted form of semantics decomposability under these restrictive assumptions: both the unaffected and the affected part consist of a set of SCCs such that the SCCs included in the unaffected part precede those included in the affected part according to the partial order induced by the attack relation. Given this observation, the notion of decomposability in this context basically corresponds to a mild generalization of decomposability w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}FSCC(AF), i.e. of the weakest notion of decomposability considered in this paper, and is definitely weaker than decomposability w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}F∪SCC(AF). Our work is definitely more general as it concerns arbitrary partitions and does not rely on the directionality property. In particular, we prove full decomposability of stable semantics, which is not directional.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The work on splitting argumentation frameworks [17] focuses on modifications involving only additions of arguments or attacks (called expansions) and, apart of this restriction, shares the main basic assumptions with [33]. Considering a subclass of expansions called weak expansions, a splitting divides an argumentation framework into two subframeworks, such that only one of them receives attacks from the other: the two subframeworks correspond to the unaffected and affected parts of [33]. To model the effect of the unaffected subframework on the affected one, in [17] a modification of the affected subframework is introduced, which involves the addition of self-attacks and bears some similarity with our notion of standard argumentation framework for an argumentation framework with input. Then, the splitting theorem of [17] provides a decomposability result for stable, admissible, preferred, complete and grounded semantics, which, due to the restriction on the partitions considered, as in the case of [33], are weaker than the ones considered in this paper.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The restrictions that one of the two parts cannot receive attacks from the other one is lifted in [15] where an arbitrary partition of a framework into two parts is called quasi splitting and, using a technical arsenal rather different than ours, the decomposability property of stable semantics is proved. We achieved the same result for stable semantics in the context of a more general analysis, covering six additional literature semantics.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       On the performance side, there are some empirical evidences that both the division-based method [32] and the splitting approach [16] may significantly reduce the computation time required for some standard problems in abstract argumentation w.r.t. to algorithms adopting a “monolithic” approach. Investigating the advantages provided by our more general approach in this respect is an important direction of future work.

       Equivalence and interchangeability between argumentation frameworks
      </section-title>

       Various notions of equivalence for argumentation frameworks have been considered in the literature. The most basic ones focus either on structural correspondences (like the notion of syntactical equivalence, i.e. equality of arguments and attacks, used in [38] or the notion of isomorphism used in [8]) or on equality of extensions (w.r.t. a given semantics), which is called equivalence tout court in [38] and is analogous to the notion of equivalence between logic programs [34]. These notions are poorly or not at all related with modularity and interchangeability issues, that may arise in various contexts and in particular in presence of some form of argumentation dynamics.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To address this limitation, the notion of strong equivalence between argumentation framework (again, analogous to the one of strong equivalence between logic programs [34]) is introduced and investigated in [38]: two frameworks F and G are strongly equivalent w.r.t. a given semantics if for any argumentation framework H, the frameworks {a mathematical formula}F∪H and {a mathematical formula}G∪H have the same extensions. Basically, F and G must preserve the same outcomes in front of any operation of expansion. Since this requirement is, in fact, very strong, weaker notions of equivalence have subsequently been considered in the literature by restricting the set of expansions of the original frameworks encompassed. In particular four subclasses of expansions (called normal, weak, strong, and local{sup:15}) are considered in [12] giving rise to four correspondent definitions of expansion equivalence all weaker than strong equivalence. A different notion of equivalence, introduced in [13], refers to the problem of minimal change: given a framework and a set of arguments E whose (credulous) acceptance has to be enforced, one is interested in identifying the minimal number of modifications that ensure the desired enforcement result. Two frameworks are minimal change equivalent, if for any set E the minimal number of modifications required to enforce E is the same in both frameworks. The relationships between all the above mentioned notions of equivalence have been analyzed in detail in [14].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The approach presented in this paper is complementary to the ones reviewed above: while these refer to several forms of invariance over the whole framework w.r.t. an operation of expansion, our work concerns invariance only in the unmodified part of the framework w.r.t. an operation of replacement. This involves a notion of equivalence in terms of Input/Output behavior and the study of the property of semantics transparency, which have no counterpart in the works cited above. As already mentioned, they can be related with the notion of strong equivalence in logic programming, while our approach is closer in spirit to the notion of modular equivalence between logic programs [37] and, more generally, with the study of modularity in this context [31]. A detailed analysis of the possible interplay between our results and the area of modular logic programming is beyond the scope of the present paper and is left for future work.

       The issue of substitutions within an argumentation framework is explicitly addressed by the notion of fibring[28] which indeed covers the more general case of combining together networks of different nature (e.g. embedding a neural network or a Bayesian network into an argumentation framework), including the special case of combination of networks of the same nature, called self-fibring. Due to the potential heterogeneity of the networks involved, however, fibring concerns the substitution of a single node of a network with an entire other network (neither of them having a notion of “interface” with the rest of the framework) and hence addresses a different kind of replacement than the one considered in this paper, which involves the two argumentation multipoles, i.e. two partial networks with well-defined interface. Moreover, the study presented in [28] covers generalized argumentation frameworks, featuring a richer set of relations (e.g. support, attacks to attacks, attacks arising from attacks, collective and disjoint attacks) than Dung's framework, and investigates how this conceptual and technical arsenal can be used to properly transform the incoming and outcoming links involving just one node into links involving the nodes of the network replacing that node. Thus, the analysis in [28] goes deeply into these complex structural manipulations, which are mostly semantics independent, and does not concern the study of specific semantics properties. Our work, as already mentioned, concerns a different kind of replacement and lies in the context of traditional Dung frameworks, where we provide a systematic assessment of interchangeability-related properties for a comprehensive set of literature semantics. Extending and relating our results to generalized frameworks in the spirit of [28] is a further interesting direction of future work.

      <paragraph>
       In [43] the notion of argumentation pattern is introduced in order to capture “general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in the design of argumentation frameworks”. Hence an argumentation pattern is understood as a reusable and modular component, in a spirit which has some analogy with the idea of argumentation multipole introduced in this paper. It has however to be observed that the notion of argumentation pattern lies at a higher level of abstraction than the one of argumentation multipole: the definition of argumentation pattern given in [43] involves a set of arguments and, basically, a set of possible labellings of these arguments. No notion of attack is explicitly involved, since an argumentation pattern captures a set of evaluation outcomes which together represent a “typical situation” seen from outside, independently of the (in fact, not necessarily univocal) underlying structure giving rise to this situation. Indeed, in [43] methods to translate (or flatten) a pattern into an argumentation framework and vice versa to extract a pattern from an argumentation framework (where arguments to be included in the pattern have been preliminarily identified) are devised. Our work, lying at different level, provides suitable technical foundations for further developments of the study of argumentation patterns. Indeed, our analysis concerning the equivalence of alternative representations of attacks to attacks in Section 9.2.2 strenghtens the analysis of patterns for so called higher-order attacks in Section 3.2 of [43]. Moreover in [43] the issue of pattern combination is mentioned as a matter of future research, which may certainly benefit from the systematic set of results provided in this paper, applicable to the underlying flattened representation.

      Conclusions
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      This paper contributes to the emerging research direction on modularity-based properties and techniques in abstract argumentation, by introducing a novel comprehensive formal corpus to describe the Input/Output behavior of argumentation frameworks along with the relevant semantics properties, and by providing a systematic assessment of seven well-known argumentation semantics in this context. Due to their foundational nature, we believe these results may play an enabling role in the development of a variety of more specific investigation lines, ranging from the sound combination of heterogeneous semantics to the definition of reusable argumentation patterns. As to future work, in addition to the many issues already included in the discussion of Section 10, we mention three further interesting lines. First, the extension of the analysis carried out in the paper to other literature semantics like the ones mainly based on the notion of conflict-freeness (e.g. stage [41], CF2 [7], [10], stage2 [30] semantics) or those featuring a parametric definition (e.g. resolution-based semantics [6]). Second, the study of argumentation synthesis problems, namely, given a desired Input/Output behavior generating an argumentation framework which produces it, possibly under some constraints concerning its structure and/or the semantics to be adopted. Third, a systematic definition of modularity-related variations of traditional computational problems in abstract argumentation, e.g. checking whether two multipoles are equivalent according to a given semantics, and the analysis of their complexity properties.

       First, it is easy too see that the three conditions of the first part of Definition 14 are satisfied by any complete labelling (see Definition 6).

As to the second part of the definition, it is immediate to see that the labelling {a mathematical formula}{(A′,in)|A∈out(LI)}∪LI is the unique complete labelling, thus it is also grounded, preferred, semi-stable and ideal. Moreover, such labelling is also stable (note that in this case there are no self-attacking arguments in the framework).  □

Moreover, {a mathematical formula}F(AF′↓I′,∅,∅,∅) is nonempty (in particular there is a unique labelling {a mathematical formula}LI′∈F(AF′↓I′,∅,∅,∅)), since Definition 15 applied to the partition {a mathematical formula}{I′} of {a mathematical formula}AF′↓I′ yields {a mathematical formula}LS(AF′↓I′)=F(AF′↓I′,∅,∅,∅) and {a mathematical formula}|LS(AF′↓I′)|=1 since S is complete-compatible.

Since by Theorem 1{a mathematical formula}LP∈FAD(AF↓P,Pinp,LAr∖P↓Pinp,PR), we have only to prove that the third condition of Definition 24 is satisfied for {a mathematical formula}LP. Given a generic argument {a mathematical formula}A∈P, if {a mathematical formula}LP(A)=undec then {a mathematical formula}L(A)=undec, and since L is a complete labelling there is no B such that {a mathematical formula}(B,A)∈att with {a mathematical formula}L(B)=in, and there is an argument C such that {a mathematical formula}(C,A)∈att and {a mathematical formula}L(C)=undec. The first condition entails that {a mathematical formula}((∀B∈Ar:(B,A)∈att,LP(B)≠in)∧(∀B∈Pinp:(B,A)∈PR,LAr∖P↓Pinp(B)≠in)). The second condition in turn entails that {a mathematical formula}((∃B∈Ar:(B,A)∈att∧LP(B)=undec)∨(∃B∈Pinp:(B,A)∈PR∧LAr∖P↓Pinp(B)=undec)).As for the other direction of the proof, let {a mathematical formula}LP1,…,LPn be n labellings of {a mathematical formula}P1,…,Pn such that {a mathematical formula}∀iLPi∈FCO(AF↓Pi,Piinp,(⋃j=1…n,j≠iLPj)↓Piinp,PiR).

       Given an argumentation framework with input {a mathematical formula}(AF,I,LI,RI), where {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), let {a mathematical formula}AF′=(Ar∪I′,att∪R′I) be the standard argumentation w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}(AF,I,LI,RI).As to {a mathematical formula}FGR, let {a mathematical formula}L′ be the grounded labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF′: we prove that {a mathematical formula}{L′↓Ar} coincides with {a mathematical formula}{L|L is minimal in FCO(AF,I,LI,RI)}. Notice that we do not assume that the definition of {a mathematical formula}FGR is well founded, i.e. that there is a unique minimal labelling in {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI): this is obtained as a by-product of the proof.First we prove that {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar is a minimal labelling of {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI). Since {a mathematical formula}L′ is by definition a complete labelling and complete semantics is top-down decomposable (see Theorem 3), it holds that {a mathematical formula}L′↓I′∈FCO(AF′↓I′,∅,∅,∅) and {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar∈FCO(AF,I,L′↓I,RI). Since by Proposition 2 it holds that {a mathematical formula}L′↓I=LI, the latter condition can be rewritten as {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar∈FCO(AF,I,LI,RI), entailing in particular that {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI) is nonempty. Suppose now by contradiction that {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar is not a minimal labelling returned by {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI): then there is a labelling {a mathematical formula}L⁎∈FCO(AF,I,LI,RI) such that {a mathematical formula}L⁎⊑L′↓Ar and {a mathematical formula}L⁎≠L′↓Ar. Note that {a mathematical formula}L′↓I′ and {a mathematical formula}L⁎ are compatible (since {a mathematical formula}L′↓I′ coincides in {a mathematical formula}I with {a mathematical formula}LI), thus from bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics {a mathematical formula}L′↓I′∪L⁎ is a complete labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF′. Since {a mathematical formula}(L′↓I′∪L⁎)⊑L′ and {a mathematical formula}(L′↓I′∪L⁎)≠L′, this contradicts the fact that {a mathematical formula}L′ is by definition the minimal (w.r.t. ⊑) complete labelling of AF.Let us now consider a labelling L of AF which is minimal among those of {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI): we prove that {a mathematical formula}L=L′↓Ar, thus also showing that there is a unique minimal labelling in {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI). Since {a mathematical formula}L′ is by definition a complete labelling and complete semantics is decomposable, it must be the case that {a mathematical formula}L′↓I′∈FCO(AF′↓I′,∅,∅,∅), thus by bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics {a mathematical formula}L′↓I′∪L is a complete labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF′ (recall that {a mathematical formula}L′ coincides in {a mathematical formula}I with {a mathematical formula}LI). By definition of grounded labelling, {a mathematical formula}L′⊑(L′↓I′∪L). Assume by contradiction that {a mathematical formula}(L′↓I′∪L)≠L′: since the grounded labelling is minimal (w.r.t. ⊑) among all complete labellings, it must be the case that {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar⊑L and {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar≠L. However, by top-down decomposability of complete semantics {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar∈FCO(AF,I,LI,RI), contradicting the minimality of L. This completes the proof as far as the canonical local function of grounded semantics is concerned.As to {a mathematical formula}FPR, we have to show that {a mathematical formula}{L′↓Ar|L′∈LPR(AF′)}={L|L is maximal in FCO(AF,I,LI,RI)}. The proof is similar to that for {a mathematical formula}FGR.First, given a preferred labelling {a mathematical formula}L′ of {a mathematical formula}AF′, we prove that {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar is a maximal labelling in {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI). Since {a mathematical formula}L′ is by definition a complete labelling, by top-down decomposability of complete semantics {a mathematical formula}L′↓I′∈FCO(AF′↓I′,∅,∅,∅) and {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar∈FCO(AF,I,LI,RI), where we exploit the fact that, by Proposition 2, {a mathematical formula}L′↓I=LI. Assume by contradiction that {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar is not a maximal labelling in {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI): this entails that there is a labelling {a mathematical formula}L⁎∈FCO(AF,I,LI,RI) such that {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar⊑L⁎ and {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar≠L⁎. Note that {a mathematical formula}L⁎ and {a mathematical formula}L′↓I′ are compatible since {a mathematical formula}L′ coincides in {a mathematical formula}I with {a mathematical formula}LI, thus from bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics {a mathematical formula}L⁎∪L′↓I′ is a complete labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF′. However, {a mathematical formula}L′⊑(L⁎∪L′↓I′) and {a mathematical formula}L′≠(L⁎∪L′↓I′), contradicting the fact that {a mathematical formula}L′ is by definition a maximal (w.r.t. ⊑) complete labelling.Let us now consider a labelling L of AF which is maximal among those of {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI): letting {a mathematical formula}L⁎ be the grounded labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF′, we prove that {a mathematical formula}L⁎↓I′∪L is a preferred labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF′. By bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics {a mathematical formula}L⁎↓I′∪L is a complete labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF′.

Since, by Proposition 2, {a mathematical formula}L′↓I′=L⁎↓I′, this entails that {a mathematical formula}L⊑L′↓Ar and {a mathematical formula}L≠L′↓Ar. However, top-down decomposability of complete semantics also entails that {a mathematical formula}L′↓Ar∈FCO(AF,I,LI,RI), contradicting the maximality of L among the labellings of {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI).  □

      <paragraph label="Proof">
       Since grounded and preferred semantics are top-down decomposable, we have only to prove bottom-up decomposability w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}F∪SCC.Let us first consider grounded semantics. Given an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), consider a partition {a mathematical formula}{P1,…,Pn}∈F∪SCC(AF), and let {a mathematical formula}LP1,…,LPn be n labellings of {a mathematical formula}P1,…,Pn such that {a mathematical formula}∀iLPi∈FGR(AF↓Pi,Piinp,(⋃j=1…n,j≠iLPj)↓Piinp,PiR). Letting {a mathematical formula}L=LP1∪…∪LPn, we prove that L is the grounded labelling of AF. Since {a mathematical formula}FGR returns a labelling of {a mathematical formula}FCO and complete semantics is bottom-up decomposable, we know that L is a complete labelling of AF: assume by contradiction that it is not the grounded labelling, thus letting {a mathematical formula}L′ be the grounded labelling of AF it must be the case that {a mathematical formula}L′⊑L and {a mathematical formula}L′≠L. Taking into account that the graph obtained by considering strongly-connected components as single nodes is acyclic, there must be a strongly connected component {a mathematical formula}S∈SCCSAF such that {a mathematical formula}L′↓S⊑L↓S and {a mathematical formula}L′↓S≠L↓S, while {a mathematical formula}L′↓Sinp=L↓Sinp (otherwise, considering a strongly connected component {a mathematical formula}S1∈SCCSAF such that {a mathematical formula}L′↓S1≠L↓S1, from {a mathematical formula}L′↓S1inp≠L↓S1inp we have {a mathematical formula}L′↓S2≠L↓S2 where {a mathematical formula}S2 is a strongly connected component such that {a mathematical formula}S1inp∩S2≠∅, and iterating this step we either obtain an infinite number of strongly connected components, which is impossible since AF is finite, or end up with a cycle of strongly connected components, which is impossible as well). By top-down decomposability of grounded semantics we have {a mathematical formula}L′↓S∈FGR(AF↓S,Sinp,L′↓Sinp,SR)=FGR(AF↓S,Sinp,L↓Sinp,SR). Now, according to the definition of {a mathematical formula}F∪SCC, there is an element {a mathematical formula}Pk of the partition such that {a mathematical formula}S⊆Pk, and by Lemma 3 applied to {a mathematical formula}LPk∈FGR(AF↓Pk,Pkinp,(⋃j=1…n,j≠iLPj)↓Pkinp,PkR) it must be the case that {a mathematical formula}L↓S∈FGR(AF↓S,Sinp,L↓Sinp,SR). However, this contradicts the two conditions {a mathematical formula}L′↓S∈FGR(AF↓S,Sinp,L↓Sinp,SR) and {a mathematical formula}L′↓S≠L↓S, since {a mathematical formula}FGR always returns a unique labelling.The proof for preferred semantics is similar. Given an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Ar,att), consider a partition {a mathematical formula}{P1,…,Pn}∈F∪SCC(AF), and let {a mathematical formula}LP1,…,LPn be n labellings of {a mathematical formula}P1,…,Pn such that {a mathematical formula}∀iLPi∈FPR(AF↓Pi,Piinp,(⋃j=1…n,j≠iLPj)↓Piinp,PiR). Letting {a mathematical formula}L=LP1∪…∪LPn, we prove that {a mathematical formula}L∈LPR(AF). By definition of {a mathematical formula}FPR and bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics, we know that L is a complete labelling of AF: assume by contradiction that it is not preferred, thus {a mathematical formula}∃L′∈LPR(AF) such that {a mathematical formula}L⊑L′ and {a mathematical formula}L≠L′. Taking into account that the graph obtained by considering strongly-connected components as single nodes is acyclic, there must be a strongly connected component {a mathematical formula}S∈SCCSAF such that {a mathematical formula}L↓S⊑L′↓S and {a mathematical formula}L↓S≠L′↓S, while {a mathematical formula}L↓Sinp=L′↓Sinp. By top-down decomposability of preferred semantics we have {a mathematical formula}L′↓S∈FPR(AF↓S,Sinp,L′↓Sinp,SR)=FPR(AF↓S,Sinp,L↓Sinp,SR). According to the definition of {a mathematical formula}F∪SCC, there is a k such that {a mathematical formula}S⊆Pk, and by Lemma 3 it holds that {a mathematical formula}L↓S∈FPR(AF↓S,Sinp,L↓Sinp,SR). However, from {a mathematical formula}L′↓S∈FPR(AF↓S,Sinp,L↓Sinp,SR)⊆FCO(AF↓S,Sinp,L↓Sinp,SR), {a mathematical formula}L↓S⊑L′↓S and {a mathematical formula}L↓S≠L′↓S we get a contradiction, since {a mathematical formula}L↓S should be a maximal labelling in {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF↓S,Sinp,L↓Sinp,SR) by definition of {a mathematical formula}FPR.  □

Moreover, according to Definition 32 it turns out that {a mathematical formula}LRS={FS(AF↓∅,∅,∅,∅)}, which by Proposition 1 is equal to {a mathematical formula}LS(AF∅), in turn equal to {a mathematical formula}{∅} by the hypothesis. Since it also holds that {a mathematical formula}LE={∅}, {a mathematical formula}R is S-legitimate if and only if it is contextually S-legitimate. In particular, {a mathematical formula}R is legitimate if and only if {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are S-equivalent, which according to Definition 30 holds if and only if {a mathematical formula}S-eff∅(M1,∅)=S-eff∅(M2,∅). Following Definition 29, {a mathematical formula}S-eff∅(M1,∅)={eff∅(∅,L↓∅,∅)|L∈FS(AF,∅,∅,∅)}, which by Proposition 1 is equal to {a mathematical formula}{eff∅(∅,L↓∅,∅)|L∈LS(AF)}, i.e. {a mathematical formula}{∅} if {a mathematical formula}|LS(AF)|&gt;0, ∅ if {a mathematical formula}LS(AF)=∅.

As a consequence, {a mathematical formula}R is S-legitimate if and only if {a mathematical formula}|LS(AF)|&gt;0∧|LS(AF2)|&gt;0, or {a mathematical formula}LS(AF)=LS(AF2)=∅. Let us finally consider the last condition. According to Definition 32, {a mathematical formula}R is S-safe if and only if {a mathematical formula}{L↓∅|L∈LS(AF)}={L↓∅|L∈LS(AF2)}. It is easy to see that the first term of this equality is equal to {a mathematical formula}{∅} if {a mathematical formula}|LS(AF)|&gt;0, it is equal to ∅ if {a mathematical formula}LS(AF)=∅. Analogously, the second term is equal to {a mathematical formula}{∅} if {a mathematical formula}|LS(AF2)|&gt;0, it is equal to ∅ if {a mathematical formula}LS(AF2)=∅. Thus {a mathematical formula}R is S-safe if and only if the third condition holds.  □

       We prove that grounded semantics satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 9 that ensure strong transparency. First, grounded semantics is single-status by definition. Moreover, we know by Proposition 10 that GR is effect-dictated and by Theorem 5 that it is top-down decomposable. Finally, consider an argumentation framework AF, an arbitrary partition {a mathematical formula}{E,D}∈FALL(AF) and two labellings {a mathematical formula}LE∈LE and {a mathematical formula}LD∈LD such that {a mathematical formula}LE∈FGR(AF↓E,Einp,LD↓Einp,ER) and {a mathematical formula}LD∈FGR(AF↓D,Dinp,LE↓Dinp,DR): taking into account that {a mathematical formula}FGR returns a subset of {a mathematical formula}FCO (see Proposition 6), by bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics (see Theorem 3) {a mathematical formula}(LE∪LD) is a complete labelling of AF. Thus, letting L be the grounded labelling of AF, by definition it must be the case that {a mathematical formula}L⊑LE∪LD.  □

       First, if {a mathematical formula}E=∅ then the claim is trivially verified, thus in the following we consider the case that {a mathematical formula}E≠∅.Assume that {a mathematical formula}M1=(AF↓D1,RINP1,ROUTP1), {a mathematical formula}AF2=T(AF,M1,M2) and {a mathematical formula}M2=(AF2↓D2,RINP2,ROUTP2). Given an argument {a mathematical formula}A∈E which is credulously justified in AF, there is a preferred labelling {a mathematical formula}L1∈LPR(AF) such that {a mathematical formula}L1(A)=in. Letting {a mathematical formula}L1E=L1↓E and {a mathematical formula}L1D1=L1↓D1, we have that {a mathematical formula}L1E∈FPR(AF↓E,M1outp,L1D1↓M1outp,ROUTP1) and {a mathematical formula}L1D1∈FPR(AF↓D1,M1inp,L1E↓M1inp,RINP1). In particular, if {a mathematical formula}D1≠∅ these conditions hold by top-down decomposability of preferred semantics (see Theorem 6), otherwise by Lemma 9. Note that, according to the first condition, {a mathematical formula}L1E∈LRPR. Since {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are PR-equivalent under {a mathematical formula}LRPR, there is a labelling {a mathematical formula}L1D2∈FPR(AF2↓D2,M2inp,L1E↓M2inp,RINP2) such that {a mathematical formula}effE(M2outp,L1D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2)=effE(M1outp,L1D1↓M1outp,ROUTP1), thus it is the case that {a mathematical formula}FPR(AF↓E,M1outp,L1D1↓M1outp,ROUTP1)=FPR(AF↓E,M2outp,L1D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2). Taking then into account that {a mathematical formula}AF↓E=AF2↓E, it holds that {a mathematical formula}L1E∈FPR(AF2↓E,M2outp,L1D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2). Since {a mathematical formula}FPR returns a subset of {a mathematical formula}FCO (see Proposition 6), the previous conditions yield {a mathematical formula}L1E∈FCO(AF2↓E,M2outp,L1D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2) and {a mathematical formula}L1D2∈FCO(AF2↓D2,M2inp,L1E↓M2inp,RINP2), thus by bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics proved in Theorem 3 (if {a mathematical formula}D2≠∅) or by Lemma 10 (if {a mathematical formula}D2=∅), {a mathematical formula}(L1E∪L1D2) is a complete labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF2.

      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       First, if {a mathematical formula}E=∅ then the replacement is PR-safe by Proposition 12, thus in the following we consider the case that {a mathematical formula}E≠∅.Assume that {a mathematical formula}M1=(AF1↓D1,RINP1,ROUTP1), {a mathematical formula}AF2=T(AF1,M1,M2) and {a mathematical formula}M2=(AF2↓D2,RINP2,ROUTP2). We have to prove that {a mathematical formula}{L1↓E|L1∈LPR(AF1)}={L2↓E|L2∈LPR(AF2)}. Similarly to previous proofs, we only prove that {a mathematical formula}{L1↓E|L1∈LPR(AF1)}⊆{L2↓E|L2∈LPR(AF2)}, since the reverse inclusion relation can be proved in the same way by exploiting the fact that the hypotheses are symmetric for {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2.Let {a mathematical formula}L1∈LPR(AF1) be an arbitrary preferred labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF1: we have to identify a labelling {a mathematical formula}L2∈LPR(AF2) such that {a mathematical formula}L1↓E=L2↓E. Letting {a mathematical formula}L1E=L1↓E and {a mathematical formula}L1D1=L1↓D1, by top-down decomposability of preferred semantics proved in Theorem 6 (if {a mathematical formula}D1≠∅) or by Lemma 9 (if {a mathematical formula}D1=∅), {a mathematical formula}L1E∈FPR(AF1↓E,M1outp,L1D1↓M1outp,ROUTP1) and {a mathematical formula}L1D1∈FPR(AF1↓D1,M1inp,L1E↓M1inp,RINP1). Note that, by the first condition, {a mathematical formula}L1E∈LRPR. Since {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are PR-equivalent under {a mathematical formula}LRPR, there is a labelling {a mathematical formula}L1D2∈FPR(AF2↓D2,M2inp,L1E↓M2inp,RINP2) such that {a mathematical formula}effE(M2outp,L1D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2)=effE(M1outp,L1D1↓M1outp,ROUTP1), entailing that {a mathematical formula}FPR(AF1↓E,M1outp,L1D1↓M1outp,ROUTP1)=FPR(AF1↓E,M2outp,L1D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2). Taking then into account that {a mathematical formula}AF1↓E=AF2↓E, it holds that {a mathematical formula}L1E∈FPR(AF2↓E,M2outp,L1D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2). Since {a mathematical formula}FPR returns a subset of {a mathematical formula}FCO (see Proposition 6), the previous conditions yield {a mathematical formula}L1E∈FCO(AF2↓E,M2outp,L1D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2) and {a mathematical formula}L1D2∈FCO(AF2↓D2,M2inp,L1E↓M2inp,RINP2), thus by bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics proved in Theorem 3 (if {a mathematical formula}D2≠∅) or by Lemma 10 (if {a mathematical formula}D2=∅), {a mathematical formula}(L1E∪L1D2) is a complete labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF2. We prove that {a mathematical formula}L2=(L1E∪L1D2)∈LPR(AF2), which yields the desired conclusion. Assume by contradiction that {a mathematical formula}L2 is not a preferred labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF2: then there is a preferred labelling {a mathematical formula}L2⁎∈LPR(AF2) such that {a mathematical formula}L2⊑L2⁎ and {a mathematical formula}L2≠L2⁎. Letting {a mathematical formula}L2⁎E=L2⁎↓E and {a mathematical formula}L2⁎D2=L2⁎↓D2, by top-down decomposability of preferred semantics (if {a mathematical formula}D2≠∅) or by Lemma 9 (if {a mathematical formula}D2=∅), it holds that {a mathematical formula}L2⁎E∈FPR(AF2↓E,M2outp,L2⁎D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2) and {a mathematical formula}L2⁎D2∈FPR(AF2↓D2,M2inp,L2⁎E↓M2inp,RINP2). Note that {a mathematical formula}L2⁎E∈LRPR. It must be the case that {a mathematical formula}L1E⊑L2⁎E and {a mathematical formula}L1E≠L2⁎E. The first condition is entailed by {a mathematical formula}L2⊑L2⁎ and {a mathematical formula}L2↓E=L1E. The second condition holds since otherwise {a mathematical formula}L1E=L2⁎E, entailing both {a mathematical formula}L1D2 and {a mathematical formula}L2⁎D2 to belong to {a mathematical formula}FPR(AF2↓D2,M2inp,L1E↓M2inp,RINP2): since {a mathematical formula}L1D2⊑L2⁎D2 and {a mathematical formula}FPR returns maximal (w.r.t. ⊑) elements of {a mathematical formula}FCO, we would have {a mathematical formula}L1D2=L2⁎D2 besides {a mathematical formula}L1E=L2⁎E, violating the condition {a mathematical formula}L2≠L2⁎. Now, taking into account the hypothesis that {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are homogeneously PR-equivalent under {a mathematical formula}LRPR, from {a mathematical formula}L1D2∈FPR(AF2↓D2,M2inp,L1E↓M2inp,RINP2), {a mathematical formula}L2⁎D2∈FPR(AF2↓D2,M2inp,L2⁎E↓M2inp,RINP2), {a mathematical formula}L1D2⊑L2⁎D2, {a mathematical formula}L1E⊑L2⁎E, {a mathematical formula}L1D1∈FPR(AF1↓D1,M1inp,L1E↓M1inp,RINP1) and {a mathematical formula}effE(M1outp,L1D1↓M1outp,ROUTP1)=effE(M2outp,L1D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2), there is a labelling {a mathematical formula}L1⁎D1∈FPR(AF1↓D1,M1inp,L2⁎E↓M1inp,RINP1) such that {a mathematical formula}L1D1⊑L1⁎D1 and {a mathematical formula}effE(M1outp,L1⁎D1↓M1outp,ROUTP1)=effE(M2outp,L2⁎D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2). Since {a mathematical formula}L2⁎E∈FPR(AF2↓E,M2outp,L2⁎D2↓M2outp,ROUTP2) and {a mathematical formula}AF2↓E=AF1↓E, the latter condition entails {a mathematical formula}L2⁎E∈FPR(AF1↓E,M1outp,L1⁎D1↓M1outp,ROUTP1). Since {a mathematical formula}FPR returns a subset of {a mathematical formula}FCO and complete semantics is decomposable, {a mathematical formula}L2⁎E∪L1⁎D1 is a complete labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF1 (again, in case {a mathematical formula}D1=∅ this is a consequence of Lemma 10). However, from {a mathematical formula}L1E⊑L2⁎E, {a mathematical formula}L1D1⊑L1⁎D1 and {a mathematical formula}L1E≠L2⁎E it holds that {a mathematical formula}L1⊑(L2⁎E∪L1⁎D1) and {a mathematical formula}L1≠(L2⁎E∪L1⁎D1), contradicting the fact that {a mathematical formula}L1∈LPR(AF1), i.e. that it is a maximal (w.r.t. ⊑) complete labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF1.  □

       As in previous proofs, the claim in the case where {a mathematical formula}E=∅ is a direct consequence of Proposition 12, thus in the following we assume {a mathematical formula}E≠∅.Let {a mathematical formula}AF2=T(AF1,M1,M2), and let {a mathematical formula}L1⁎ and {a mathematical formula}L2⁎ be the ideal labellings of {a mathematical formula}AF1 and {a mathematical formula}AF2, respectively. We prove that {a mathematical formula}L1⁎↓E⊑L2⁎↓E (the other direction of the proof can be obtained by a symmetric reasoning). Since by definition {a mathematical formula}L1⁎ is a complete labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF1 and CO is strongly transparent, there is a complete labelling {a mathematical formula}L2 of {a mathematical formula}AF2 such that {a mathematical formula}L2↓E=L1⁎↓E. We prove that for any preferred labelling {a mathematical formula}LP2 of {a mathematical formula}AF2 it holds that {a mathematical formula}L2⊑LP2: since {a mathematical formula}L2⁎ is by definition the maximal (w.r.t. ⊑) complete labelling satisfying this condition, it must be the case that {a mathematical formula}L2⊑L2⁎, thus in particular {a mathematical formula}L2↓E=L1⁎↓E⊑L2⁎↓E.First we prove that the hypotheses of Corollary 1 are satisfied for {a mathematical formula}R, thus {a mathematical formula}R is PR-safe. Since {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are CO-equivalent under {a mathematical formula}LRCO, by Lemma 6 they are also PR-equivalent under {a mathematical formula}LRCO, and since {a mathematical formula}FPR always returns a subset of {a mathematical formula}FCO it holds that {a mathematical formula}LRPR⊆LRCO, therefore {a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are PR-equivalent under {a mathematical formula}LRPR. Moreover, by Lemma 8{a mathematical formula}M1 and {a mathematical formula}M2 are internally PR-homogeneous under {a mathematical formula}LRPR.Let us turn to the proof that {a mathematical formula}L2⊑LP2. Let {a mathematical formula}Args2 be the set of arguments of {a mathematical formula}AF2, and {a mathematical formula}D2=Args2∖E. First, it must be the case that {a mathematical formula}L2↓E⊑LP2↓E: since {a mathematical formula}R is PR-safe, there is a preferred labelling {a mathematical formula}LP1 of {a mathematical formula}AF1 such that {a mathematical formula}LP2↓E=LP1↓E, and by definition of ideal labelling {a mathematical formula}L1⁎⊑LP1, thus in particular {a mathematical formula}L1⁎↓E⊑LP1↓E, and the conclusion follows by taking into account that {a mathematical formula}L2↓E=L1⁎↓E. Second, by top-down decomposability of complete semantics (if {a mathematical formula}D2≠∅) or by Lemma 9 (if {a mathematical formula}D2=∅), {a mathematical formula}L2↓D2∈FCO(AF2↓D2,M2inp,L2↓M2inp,RINP2) and {a mathematical formula}LP2↓D2∈FCO(AF2↓D2,M2inp,LP2↓M2inp,RINP2), thus by Lemma 7{a mathematical formula}L2↓E⊑LP2↓E also entails that {a mathematical formula}L2↓D2⊑LP2↓D2.
