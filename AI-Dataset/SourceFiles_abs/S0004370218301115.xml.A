      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      One of the main goals underlying the research area of belief change consists in finding appropriate ways of modelling how the belief state of an (idealized rational) agent is modified when it receives some new information leading it to give up one of its current beliefs. More precisely, several of the main references of this area deal with the definition and characterization of operators that receive a set of sentences (representing the belief state of an agent) and a sentence (representing a belief that is intended to be given up by that agent) and return a set of sentences (that models the new belief state of that agent) which:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="(i)">
       is a subset of the received set of sentences;
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="(ii)">
       does not logically imply the received sentence (provided that it is not a tautology).
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      An operator that receives a pair of inputs, as described above, and returns an output satisfying (i) and (ii) is said to satisfy the postulates of inclusion and success, respectively, and is commonly called a contraction (e.g. [24, page 65]).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The one which is currently considered the standard model in the belief change literature is known as AGM model—after the initials of its three creators: Carlos Alchourrón, Peter Gärdenfors and David Makinson—and has been originally presented in [1]. In that framework, each belief of an agent is represented by a sentence (of a propositional language {a mathematical formula}L) and the belief state of an agent is represented by a logically closed set of (belief-representing) sentences. These sets are called belief sets. In that paper some properties are proposed as being the characteristic properties of a contraction. Nowadays, these properties (which are recalled in Subsection 2.2) are commonly referred to as the AGM postulates for contraction and an operator that satisfies them is called an AGM contraction.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Several constructive definitions of operators which satisfy all or at least some of the AGM postulates for contraction have been provided in the literature. Some of the most well-known of those models are the (transitively relational) partial meet contractions[1], safe contraction[3], [28], system of spheres-based contraction[15] and epistemic entrenchment-based contraction[12], [13].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Nevertheless, the AGM model has also been the subject of many critiques and, not long after its publication, several variants of that model started to appear in the literature.{sup:1} From among those proposals we highlight (for being the ones that are directly related to the present work) the following classes of belief change operators:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="(a)">
       Classes of contractions which can be seen as generalizations of (some of) the above mentioned constructive definitions of AGM contractions to the case when the belief states of an agent are represented by sets of sentences not (necessarily) closed under logical consequence—the so-called belief bases—rather than by belief sets.
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="(b)">
       Classes of, so-called, non-prioritized contractions, which are “contraction” operators that do not satisfy the success postulate.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      From among the classes mentioned in (a) above we highlight the partial meet contractions, presented in [19], [20], [17]; the kernel contractions—which can be seen as a generalization of safe contractions and are defined for belief bases—that were introduced in [21]; and the ensconcement-based contractions, that were proposed in [29] and can be seen as adaptations to the case of belief bases of the epistemic entrenchment-based contractions. These kind of change operators for belief bases have arisen in order to address the criticisms to the AGM framework concerning the use of logically closed sets (or belief sets) to model the belief state of an agent. Belief sets are very large entities, and its use is not adequate for computational implementations. Any attempt to computationally implement the theory of belief change will have to be based on a finite representation. Furthermore, as Gärdenfors and Rott pointed out “when we perform revisions or contractions, it seems that we never do it to the belief set itself (…) but rather on some typically finite base for the belief set” [14]. A set A is a base for a belief set K if and only if {a mathematical formula}Cn(A)=K. A sentence α is believed if and only if {a mathematical formula}α∈Cn(A).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In what concerns the classes of operators mentioned in (b), the pioneering work on that topic is [6], where Fermé and Hansson introduced the concept of shielded contraction. The motivation for the proposal of this kind of operators was the fact that, as pointed out by Rott [27], the success postulate is not a fully realistic requirement since an agent can have several (non-tautological) beliefs that he/she is not willing, for various reasons, to give up. Thus, shielded contractions are operators that for some inputs behave just as (standard) contractions and for other inputs just do not have any effect at all—in the sense that they simply return (as output) the belief state received as input.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We should, however, note here that the AGM belief change operators are not intended to force an agent to remove or incorporate beliefs that he/she is unwilling to remove or incorporate, but that such change operations are only applied for those beliefs that the agent decides to remove or incorporate after performing some type of previous processing of the information.{sup:2} In the AGM model, this information preprocessing is left implicit. In the case of the (shielded contraction) operators studied in this paper this prior information processing is made explicit by means of a specification of the set of those beliefs that the agent is willing to remove in terms of properties (whose influence in the quality of the associated shielded contraction operator is analysed).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In [6], a shielded contraction is defined by means of an AGM contraction and a set of sentences R satisfying certain properties, named set of retractable sentences, which models the set of sentences that the agent is willing to give up (if needed). Informally speaking, the shielded contraction is a function that receives (just as a standard contraction does) a belief set and a sentence and returns:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="•">
       The received belief set (unchanged), if the received sentence is not included in R;
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="•">
       The output produced by the associated AGM contraction (when it receives those two inputs), if the received sentence is in R.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      In the present paper we define and thoroughly study twenty classes of operators, which can be thought as combining the central features of the classes of operators mentioned in (a) and (b) above, since the operators that we shall consider are “contractions” defined for belief bases and which do not (necessarily) satisfy the postulate of success. More precisely, we shall study shielded contractions defined for belief bases (rather than for belief sets). Until now, only one class of such operators has been considered in the belief change literature, namely a class of shielded contractions on belief bases defined by means of a partial meet contraction and a set of retractable sentences (satisfying certain properties), which was presented and axiomatically characterized in [10] (and which is recalled in Subsection 2.4). In this paper we consider classes of shielded base contraction induced by several well-known kinds of base contractions (not only partial meet contractions) and several kinds of sets of retractable sentences (i.e. we consider several different, and non-equivalent, sets of properties for characterizing a set of retractable sentences). We axiomatically characterize all the classes of shielded base contractions considered and study the interrelations among them, namely by investigating if each of those classes is or is not (strictly) contained in each one of the remaining classes considered.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      At this point we remark that the study of shielded base contractions is a relevant topic in the field of artificial intelligence with applications in different areas. For example in the database context, the programmer may specify integrity constrains that are not liable to be retracted. Another example is a normative system in which some norms are not liable to be retracted from the system. More generally shielded contractions may be useful for modelling the behaviour of an agent when confronted with some new information that contradicts one (or more) of his present beliefs. In such a situation, two reasonable possible behaviours are the following: either the agent disregards the new information (and keeps its belief state unchanged) or it accepts the new information and changes its belief state accordingly, namely by, roughly speaking, giving up the ones of its previous beliefs which are contradicted by the new information received. Indeed, it is not expectable that a rational agent will believe every new information it receives and that is the reason why shielded contraction was proposed as a two steps process. When some new information is received whose acceptance would force the removal of some belief, first it is checked whether the agent is willing to give up that belief, and only if that is confirmed to be the case, does the removal of that belief occur (in a second step). We notice that (standard) contraction functions do not model the phase of assessing the acceptability of the removal of a sentence.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the notations and recall the main background concepts that will be needed throughout this article. In Section 3 we present a formal definition of shielded base contraction and introduce some desirable properties that a given set of retractable sentences should satisfy. We present several results highlighting the interrelations among the properties satisfied by a shielded base contraction operator and the properties satisfied by the (standard) contraction and the set of retractable sentences which induce that shielded contraction. Afterwards, in Section 4 we present axiomatic characterizations for the following classes of shielded base contractions: shielded contractions induced by partial meet contractions, (two classes of) shielded contractions induced by kernel contractions, and shielded contractions induced by basic AGM-generated base contractions. For each one of these four classes, we shall identify five different subclasses—each one associated to a certain list of properties of the set of retractable sentences. In Section 5 we analyse the interrelations among (all) the classes of shielded contractions considered in terms of the relation of (strict) inclusion. In Section 6 we briefly recall the main operators of non-prioritized belief change (other than shielded contractions) so far presented in the literature. Finally, in Section 7 we summarize the main contributions of the paper and briefly discuss their relevance. In the Appendix we provide proofs for all the original results presented.

       We will assume a propositional language {a mathematical formula}L that contains the usual truth functional connectives: ¬ (negation), ∧ (conjunction), ∨ (disjunction), → (implication) and ↔ (equivalence). We shall make use of a consequence operation Cn that takes sets of sentences to sets of sentences and which satisfies the standard Tarskian properties, namely inclusion, monotony and iteration. Furthermore we will assume that Cn satisfies supraclassicality, compactness and deduction. We will sometimes use {a mathematical formula}Cn(α) for {a mathematical formula}Cn({α}), {a mathematical formula}A⊢α for {a mathematical formula}α∈Cn(A), ⊢α for {a mathematical formula}α∈Cn(∅), {a mathematical formula}A⊬α for {a mathematical formula}α∉Cn(A), ⊬α for {a mathematical formula}α∉Cn(∅). The letters {a mathematical formula}α,β,… (except for γ) will be used to denote sentences of {a mathematical formula}L. Lowercase Latin letters such as {a mathematical formula}p,q,… will be used to denote atomic sentences of {a mathematical formula}L. {a mathematical formula}A,B,… shall denote sets of sentences of {a mathematical formula}L. K is reserved to represent a set of sentences that is closed under logical consequence (i.e. {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(K))—such a set is called a belief set or theory. Given {a mathematical formula}A⊆L, we shall say that − is a (contraction) operator (or function) on A when − is a function such that {a mathematical formula}−:L⟶P(L). Furthermore, in that context, we shall represent by {a mathematical formula}A−α the image of a sentence α by −.

       AGM contractions and their associated shielded contractions
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       We start this subsection by recalling the AGM postulates for contraction and the concept of AGM contraction.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 2.1">
       [1]Let K be a belief set. An operator − on K is an AGM contraction if and only if it satisfies the following conditions: ({a mathematical formula}K−1){a mathematical formula}K−α=Cn(K−α). (Closure)({a mathematical formula}K−2){a mathematical formula}K−α⊆K. (Inclusion)({a mathematical formula}K−3)If {a mathematical formula}α∉K, then {a mathematical formula}K−α=K. (Vacuity)({a mathematical formula}K−4)If {a mathematical formula}α∉Cn(∅), then {a mathematical formula}α∉K−α. (Success)({a mathematical formula}K−5)If {a mathematical formula}α↔β∈Cn(∅), then {a mathematical formula}K−α=K−β. (Extensionality)({a mathematical formula}K−6){a mathematical formula}K⊆Cn((K−α)∪{α}). (Recovery)({a mathematical formula}K−7){a mathematical formula}(K−α)∩(K−β)⊆K−(α∧β). (Conjunctive overlap)({a mathematical formula}K−8){a mathematical formula}K−(α∧β)⊆K−α whenever {a mathematical formula}α∉K−(α∧β). (Conjunctive inclusion)These conditions are called the AGM postulates for contraction. Postulates ({a mathematical formula}K−1)–({a mathematical formula}K−6) are named basic AGM postulates for contraction and an operator − that satisfies those properties is called a basic AGM contraction. Postulates ({a mathematical formula}K−7) and ({a mathematical formula}K−8) are designated by supplementary AGM postulates for contraction.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Motivated by the fact that an agent can have several non-tautological beliefs that he/she is not willing to give up, Fermé and Hansson [6] presented a new kind of operators, called shielded contractions, constructed by means of a basic AGM contraction and a set of sentences R, as we recall in the following definition.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 2.2">
       [6]Let K be a belief set, − be a basic AGM contraction on K and R a subset of {a mathematical formula}L. Then {a mathematical formula}−∘− is the shielded contraction operator induced by − and R if and only if:{a mathematical formula} The set R is called the set of retractable sentences (associated to the shielded contraction {a mathematical formula}−∘−).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       According to the above definition, the operator {a mathematical formula}−∘− has the same behaviour of the contraction operator − by which is induced when it is applied to a sentence that is included in R, but is such that it leaves the set to be contracted unchanged whenever the belief, that is to be contracted, is not included in R. For this reason, the sentences included in R are called retractable (sentences) and the remaining ones are designated by irretractable.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In that paper, the following rationality criteria for R were proposed: Conjunctive Completeness:If {a mathematical formula}α∧β∈R, then {a mathematical formula}α∈R or {a mathematical formula}β∈R.Non-retractability Propagation:If {a mathematical formula}α∉R, then {a mathematical formula}Cn(α)∩R=∅.Non-retractability Preservation:{a mathematical formula}L\R⊆K−∘−α.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Conjunctive Completeness states that if α and β are irretractable, then {a mathematical formula}α∧β is also irretractable. In fact, in order to remove a conjunction we must remove at least one of its conjuncts. Therefore, a conjunction of two irretractable sentences must itself be irretractable. Non-retractability Propagation says that if a sentence α is irretractable, then all its logical consequences are also irretractable. Non-retractability Preservation states that irretractable sentences cannot be removed, independently of the (shielded) contraction performed, i.e. irretractable sentences should be (kept) in the outcome of the (shielded) contraction by any sentence.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We note that non-retractability preservation is a condition interrelating R and {a mathematical formula}−∘−, rather than a property of R. Furthermore, if it is considered as a property of R then more rigorously it should be named non-retractability preservation with respect toKand{a mathematical formula}−∘− since it relates R and the outcomes of the contraction of K by means of {a mathematical formula}−∘−. However, we will use the shorter designation for it, since everywhere this property shall be mentioned throughout this paper it will be clear from the context which belief set and shielded contraction are being considered.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Two classes of shielded contractions were axiomatically characterized in [6]: (i) the class of shielded contractions induced by a basic AGM contraction and a set R that satisfies non-retractability propagation and conjunctive completeness (Observation 2.3), and (ii) the class of shielded contractions induced by an AGM contraction and a set R that satisfies non-retractability propagation, conjunctive completeness and non-retractability preservation (Observation 2.4).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Before presenting those two representation theorems we introduce the following postulates that are needed in those axiomatizations:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Relative success[27]{a mathematical formula}K−∘−α=K or {a mathematical formula}α∉K−∘−α.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Persistence[6] If {a mathematical formula}K−∘−β⊢β, then {a mathematical formula}K−∘−α⊢β.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Success propagation[6] If {a mathematical formula}K−∘−β⊢β and {a mathematical formula}⊢β→α, then {a mathematical formula}K−∘−α⊢α.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Conjunctive constancy[6] If {a mathematical formula}K−∘−α=K−∘−β=K, then {a mathematical formula}K−∘−(α∧β)=K.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Relative success states that when contracting by any given sentence either that sentence is effectively removed, or the belief set is left unchanged. Persistence intuitively states that if a belief is kept when trying to contract a belief set K by it, then it should also be kept when contracting K by any other belief. Success propagation states that if a certain sentence is not removed when trying to contract a belief set by it, then the same thing happens regarding every logical consequence of that sentence. Conjunctive constancy states that if the contraction by a given conjunction causes a change, then the same thing happens when contracting by at least one of its conjuncts.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Next, and to finish this subsection, we present the two above mentioned representation theorems.

       Belief base contraction
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The AGM model only accounts for the case when the belief state of an agent is represented by a set of sentences that is closed under logical consequence (i.e. a belief set or theory). However, not long after the publication of the AGM paper, several criticisms were made pointing out the (impractical) use of belief sets to represent belief states. Among these criticisms we can mention: (i) Belief sets are often too big (if not even infinite), this makes belief sets inadequate for computational implementations of belief change models. (ii) Belief sets make no distinction between different inconsistent belief states. (iii) Belief sets make no distinction between basic beliefs and those that are inferred by them. Several of the existing models of contraction for beliefs sets have been adapted to the case when belief states are represented by belief bases: the partial meet contractions for belief bases were presented in [19], [20], [17]; the kernel contractions—which can be seen as a generalization of safe contractions—were introduced in [21]; and, in [29], Mary-Anne Williams introduced the ensconcement-based contractions (of belief bases), which can be seen as adaptations to the case of belief bases of the epistemic entrenchment-based contractions.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In this subsection we recall some of the postulates and several well-known constructive models of contraction functions on belief bases.

        Postulates for base contraction
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        We start by recalling the definition of a contraction operator in terms of postulates presented in [24].
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Definition 2.5">
        [24]An operator ÷ for a set A is an operator of contraction if and only if ÷ satisfies the following postulates: Success:If ⊬α then {a mathematical formula}A÷α⊬α.Inclusion:{a mathematical formula}A÷α⊆A.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        The following postulates are well known postulates for belief base contraction{sup:3}: Failure:If ⊢α then {a mathematical formula}A÷α=A.Vacuity:If {a mathematical formula}A⊬α, then {a mathematical formula}A⊆A÷α.Relative closure:{a mathematical formula}A∩Cn(A÷α)⊆A÷α.Relevance:If {a mathematical formula}β∈A and {a mathematical formula}β∉A÷α then there is some set {a mathematical formula}A′ such that {a mathematical formula}A÷α⊆A′⊆A and {a mathematical formula}α∉Cn(A′) but {a mathematical formula}α∈Cn(A′∪{β}).Core-retainment:If {a mathematical formula}β∈A and {a mathematical formula}β∉A÷α then there is some set {a mathematical formula}A′ such that {a mathematical formula}A′⊆A and {a mathematical formula}α∉Cn(A′) but {a mathematical formula}α∈Cn(A′∪{β}).Disjunctive elimination:If {a mathematical formula}β∈A and {a mathematical formula}β∉A÷α, then {a mathematical formula}A÷α⊬α∨β.Extensionality:If {a mathematical formula}⊢α↔β, then {a mathematical formula}A÷α=A÷β.Uniformity:If it holds for all subsets {a mathematical formula}A′ of A that {a mathematical formula}α∈Cn(A′) if and only if {a mathematical formula}β∈Cn(A′), then {a mathematical formula}A÷α=A÷β.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Failure[11], vacuity and relative closure[18] formalize the minimal change criteria, according to which, unnecessary loss of information should be avoided. Failure states that when contracting by a tautology, the set to be contracted is left unchanged. Vacuity ensures that nothing is lost when contracting a set by a sentence that is not a consequence of that set. Relative closure ensures that the original beliefs that are implied by the contracted set are kept. Relevance[16], [19], core-retainment[18] and disjunctive elimination[9] were also proposed to capture the principle of minimal change. It is interesting to notice that both core-retainment and disjunctive elimination follow from relevance. Extensionality is a formalization of the irrelevance of syntax criteria, according to which the outcome of a change should not depend on the syntax/representation used. It states that contracting by logically equivalent sentences produces the same outcome. Uniformity[19] is a stronger version of extensionality, it states that when α and β are two sentences implied by exactly the same subsets of A, then the result of contracting A by α is identical to the outcome of contracting A by β.

        The outcome of contracting a belief base A by a sentence α should be a subset of A that fails to imply α (whenever that is possible). In the outcome of this contraction no elements of A should be unnecessarily removed.

      Shielded base contraction

      In this paper we extend the definition of shielded base contraction proposed in [10], by defining operators of shielded base contraction in terms of other kinds of contraction functions (rather than only by means of partial meet contractions). In this section we start by introducing a definition for shielded base contractions which constitutes a generalization of the class of operators presented in Definition 2.20. After that we propose some new properties that are adequate to require from a set of retractable sentences and we study the interrelations among these properties and the properties associated to sets of retractable sentences in [6] and in [10] (which we have recalled in the previous section).

        New properties for the set of retractable sentences
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        We start by introducing the following property which states that two logically equivalent sentences should be both retractable or both irretractable. Retractability of Logical Equivalents:If {a mathematical formula}⊢α↔β, then {a mathematical formula}α∈R if and only if {a mathematical formula}β∈R.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Another property that is natural to expect is the following one, which attests that a conjunction is retractable as long as one of its conjuncts is so. Converse Conjunctive Completeness:If {a mathematical formula}α∈R, then {a mathematical formula}α∧β∈R.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Additionally, we propose some other properties interconnecting R and A that are natural to expect: Uniform Retractability:If it holds for all subsets {a mathematical formula}A′ of A that {a mathematical formula}α∈Cn(A′) if and only if {a mathematical formula}β∈Cn(A′), then {a mathematical formula}α∈R if and only if {a mathematical formula}β∈R.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Uniform retractability states that if two sentences α and β are implied by exactly the same subsets of A, then they are both retractable or both irretractable. Non-retractability Upper Bounding:{a mathematical formula}L\R⊆Cn(A).
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Non-retractability upper bounding states that all irretractable sentences are deducible from the set to be contracted. We notice that this property is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}L\Cn(A)⊆R which is mentioned in the representation results of [6] that we have recalled in Subsection 2.2.{sup:5}
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        At this point we propose the following condition that relates a set of retractable sentences R and a contraction function ÷:{a mathematical formula}
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        The intuition underlying this condition is the following:
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Ideally the irretractable sentences should not be removed from the belief base when a shielded contraction (by any sentence) is performed. Then, if a set (of retractable sentences) R and a contraction ÷ are intended to be used to define a shielded contraction it should hold that if a sentence is not in R (i.e., is considered irretractable), then it should not be removed when using ÷ to contract by a sentence included in R (i.e., by a sentence that is considered retractable).{sup:6} The following example clarifies this reasoning.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Example 3.2">
        Let {a mathematical formula}A={p,q} and {a mathematical formula}R=L\Cn(p), where Cn is purely truth-functional.{sup:7} Consider a contraction operator ÷ such that {a mathematical formula}A÷(p∧q)={q}. If ∼ is the shielded contraction induced by ÷ and R, it holds that:{a mathematical formula} This contradicts one of the main goals underlying the concept of “irretractability”: irretractable sentences should be kept (more precisely, should be implied) after performing the related shielded contraction (by any sentence). We note that this happens because R and ÷ do not satisfy condition (R - ÷). Indeed, {a mathematical formula}p∉R and {a mathematical formula}p∧q∈R but {a mathematical formula}A÷(p∧q)⊬p.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        From a different perspective, we can say that condition (R - ÷) imposes that R and ÷ are such that the complement of R consists precisely of the sentences which are more difficult to remove by means of ÷.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        We note that if R and ÷ satisfy condition (R - ÷), then the shielded contraction that is induced by R and ÷ satisfies the persistence postulate. This will be stated more formally in Theorem 3.8 (b).
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Throughout this paper we shall often say, by abuse of language, that R satisfies condition (R - ÷), instead of saying that R and ÷ satisfy condition (R - ÷).

        We note that, if {a mathematical formula}R≠L satisfies non-retractability propagation, then it is not logically closed i.e., the fact that {a mathematical formula}R⊢α does not imply that {a mathematical formula}α∈R.

        According to the above result, given a shielded base contraction ∼ induced by a contraction operator ÷ and a set (of retractable) sentences R, in the presence of non-retractability upper bounding, the properties of non-retractability preservation and (R - ÷) are equivalent. Nevertheless, we note that, condition (R - ÷) relates two structures (namely ÷ and R) that are independent of each other, while, on the other hand, non-retractability preservation presents a relation between a shielded contraction ∼ and its associated set of retractable sentences. Therefore, in the process of constructing a shielded base contraction (as exposed in Definition 3.1) it is more natural to consider condition (R - ÷) than non-retractability preservation.

      Axiomatic characterizations of different kinds of shielded base contractions
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      In this section we propose and axiomatically characterize several classes of shielded contraction functions. We start by presenting, in Subsection 4.1 a representation theorem for the operators that satisfy relative success and inclusion, which constitute the most general class of shielded contractions that we will consider. Afterwards in Subsections 4.2–4.5 we consider some more specific classes of shielded contractions. More precisely we consider the classes of shielded contractions induced by different well-known kinds of contraction functions (namely, partial meet, (smooth) kernel and basic AGM-generated base contractions) and by several alternative types of sets of retractable sentences (i.e. considering different sets of properties associated to the related set of retractable sentences). We note that the proofs provided in the Appendix for the representation theorems included here rely very strongly on the results presented in the previous section.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      All the Subsections 4.2–4.5 have a similar structure. In each one of these subsections firstly a theorem is presented which provides axiomatic characterizations for five classes of shielded contractions all induced by a same kind of contraction function but each of them with a different type of associated set of retractable sentences. Afterwards, a definition is presented where a designation is proposed for each one of the operators that were axiomatically characterized in the previously presented theorem. The reason for providing a designation for each of the considered classes of operators only after presenting the corresponding axiomatic characterization is the fact that the designation proposed for each class is based on the names of some of the postulates that are included in that axiomatic characterization.

       Basic shielded base contractions
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In Definition 3.1 we have introduced, from a constructive perspective, the concept of shielded base contraction induced by a contraction operator ÷ and a set of retractable sentences R. At this point we notice that if, alternatively, we wished to define shielded base contractions in terms of postulates then, having in mind (i) the definition for contraction recalled in Definition 2.5, and (ii) the postulates for shielded contraction presented in Subsections 2.3 and 2.4, the most natural proposal would be to define a shielded base contraction as an operator that satisfies the postulates of relative success and inclusion.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It follows trivially from Definition 3.1 that any shielded contraction satisfies inclusion. However, somehow surprisingly, a shielded contraction operator induced by a (general) contraction operator ÷ (i.e. an operator ÷ that satisfies success and inclusion) and a set of retractable sentences {a mathematical formula}R⊆L (which is not required to satisfy any properties at all) does not satisfy the postulate of relative success. Indeed, in order to assure that a shielded base contraction ∼ induced by a contraction ÷ and a set R satisfies relative success, it is necessary to impose that ÷ satisfies the postulate of failure and/or that the set R satisfies non-retractability of tautology. This fact is formally stated in the following theorem.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 4.1">
       Let A be a belief base and ∼ an operator on A. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

      <paragraph>
       Having in mind the above theorem and the discussion that preceded it, we are led to consider that the most general kind of shielded contractions that are worth considering (in the sense that these are the most general operators that satisfy the minimal set of properties that are intuitively associated to the notion of shielded contraction) are the ones that we introduce in the following definition.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 4.2">
       A shielded base contraction ∼ on a belief base A induced by a contraction ÷ and a set {a mathematical formula}R⊆L is a basic shielded contraction if and only if ÷ satisfies failure or R satisfies non-retractability of tautology.

       In the following result we present an axiomatic characterization for the basic shielded contractions, which follows trivially from Theorem 4.1.

       In the remainder of this section we will obtain axiomatic characterizations for other less general classes of shielded contractions (which are strict subclasses of the class of basic shielded contractions). More precisely, we will consider the shielded contractions on belief bases induced by partial meet contractions, by (smooth) kernel contractions and by basic AGM-generated base contractions and, additionally, we will take into account different sets of properties regarding the associated set of retractable sentences R.

       The following theorem presents axiomatic characterizations for five kinds of operators of shielded contraction on belief bases. All these operators are induced by partial meet contractions but each one of them has a different type of associated set of retractable sentences.{sup:10}

      <paragraph>
       Throughout this paper we will sometimes use the acronyms introduced in the first column of the table above, to designate the whole class of the corresponding kind of operators (instead of only one of the elements of that class). It will always be clear by the context whether the acronym is being used to denote a class of operators or a single operator.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It is worth to mention here that, since in the proof of the right-to-left part of Theorem 4.4 we used the set {a mathematical formula}R={α:A∼α⊬α}, it follows from Observation 3.4 (a) and Theorem 3.9 that in each row of the tables presented in Theorem 4.4 and in Definition 4.5, to the list of properties of R (there presented) we can add the following ones: non-retractability of tautology, non-retractability upper-bounding and retractability of logical equivalents. Furthermore, in the case of the last row, besides the three properties mentioned above, uniform retractability, non-retractability propagation, conjunctive completeness and non-retractability preservation can also be added to the list of properties of R (there presented). In fact, according to Observation 3.6, in the last row of the tables presented in Theorem 4.4 and in Definition 4.5, condition (R - ÷) can even be replaced by non-retractability preservation.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We note that it follows from the above remark that there are several alternative (equivalent) definitions for the classes introduced in Definition 4.5, more precisely several equivalent definitions, but each one with a different set of properties associated to the set R.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       This same situation occurs regarding the classes of shielded contractions introduced in Definition 4.9, Definition 4.12, Definition 4.15 (that will appear in the following subsections).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The following corollary follows trivially from the above definition and Theorem 4.4.

      <paragraph label="Corollary 4.6">
       Let ∼ be an operator on A. Then:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       At this point it is worth to notice that the axiomatic characterization given in the last row of the above table is identical to the axiomatic characterization presented in [10] (that we recalled in Observation 2.23). Therefore, the class formed by the operators designated in Definition 4.5 by persistent shielded partial meet contraction coincides with the class of shielded contractions that was axiomatically characterized in [10].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Next we present examples of shielded contraction operators that belong to some of the classes introduced in Definition 4.5 but do not belong to others. These examples allow us to conclude that the classes mentioned in Definition 4.5 are all different from each other.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 4.7">
       Let {a mathematical formula}A={p,q}, Cn be purely truth-functional and ÷ be a partial meet contraction on A such that {a mathematical formula}A÷(p∧q)={p} and {a mathematical formula}A÷(p∨q)=∅. Let ∼ be the operator of shielded base contraction induced by ÷ and a set R.

        If {a mathematical formula}R=L\(Cn(p)∪Cn(q)), then R satisfies uniform retractability and non-retractability propagation.{sup:11} Therefore, by Definition 4.5, ∼ is a SPMC and a SP-SPMC. On the other hand it holds that {a mathematical formula}p∉R, {a mathematical formula}q∉R and {a mathematical formula}p∧q∈R. Hence {a mathematical formula}A∼p=A∼q=A but {a mathematical formula}A∼(p∧q)=A÷(p∧q)={p}≠A. Thus ∼ does not satisfy conjunctive constancy. Therefore, according to Corollary 4.6, ∼ is not a CC-SPMC nor a SP+CC-SPMC.
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(b)">
        If {a mathematical formula}R=L\(Cn(∅)∪(Cn(p)∖Cn(q))), then R satisfies uniform retractability and conjunctive completeness.{sup:12}Therefore, according to Definition 4.5, ∼ is a SPMC and a CC-SPMC. On the other hand it holds that {a mathematical formula}p∨q∈R and {a mathematical formula}p∉R. From the latter it follows that {a mathematical formula}A∼p=A, thus {a mathematical formula}A∼p⊢p. It holds that {a mathematical formula}⊢p→(p∨q) and that {a mathematical formula}A∼(p∨q)=A÷(p∨q)=∅. Hence {a mathematical formula}A∼(p∨q)⊬p∨q. Thus ∼ does not satisfy success propagation. Therefore, according to Corollary 4.6, ∼ is not a SP-SPMC nor a SP+CC-SPMC.
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="(c)">
        If {a mathematical formula}R=L\Cn(q), then R satisfies conjunctive completeness, non-retractability propagation and uniform retractability.{sup:13}Therefore, according to Definition 4.5 ∼ is a SP+CC-SPMC (and also a SP-SPMC, a CC-SPMC and a SPMC). On the other hand it holds that {a mathematical formula}p∧q∈R and {a mathematical formula}q∉R. Hence {a mathematical formula}A∼q=A⊢q and {a mathematical formula}A∼(p∧q)=A÷(p∧q)⊬q. Thus ∼ does not satisfy persistence. Therefore, according to Corollary 4.6, ∼ is not a P-SPMC.

Considering, for example, the class SP+CC-SSKC, by observing this table we can see that these operators satisfy success propagation, conjunctive constancy, relative closure, uniformity, core-retainment, relative success, inclusion, vacuity and extensionality. Furthermore, we can also see that a SP+CC-SSKC is a shielded contraction induced by (a smooth kernel contraction and) a set of retractable sentences that satisfies non-retractability propagation, conjunctive completeness, uniform-retractability and retractability of logical equivalents.

     <paragraph>
      In Section 2 we have recalled several classes of non-prioritized contractions, namely shielded contractions for belief sets and for belief bases. Most of the remaining work on non-prioritized belief change presented in the literature deals with revision (rather than contraction). In this section we shall present a brief survey of existing works on non-prioritized belief revision.{sup:19}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Makinson proposed in [26] an operator of non-prioritized belief revision designated by screened revision. In this model a set A of sentences that are immune to revision is considered and a revision of a belief set K by a given sentence α only gives rise to a new (appropriately changed) belief set if the input sentence α is consistent with {a mathematical formula}A∩K (otherwise the belief set K is left unchanged).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      A more general approach was proposed by Hansson in [22], by replacing A by a function f that is applied to the (input) sentence by which the belief set is revised. This proposal was called generalized screened revision. Several properties were proposed for f. For example, {a mathematical formula}f(α)={β:α&lt;β}, where &lt; is a binary relation on {a mathematical formula}L.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Credibility-limited revision[25] is another operator of non-prioritized revision. When revising a belief set by a sentence, it is first analysed whether that sentence is credible or not. When revising by a credible sentence, the operator works as an AGM revision operator, otherwise it leaves the original belief set unchanged. This construction can be further specified by adding constrains to the structure of C (the set of credible sentences). In [25] several properties that are natural to be expected to be satisfied by such a set were proposed and several representation theorems were presented. Also in [25] this model was developed in terms of epistemic entrenchment and possible world models. Later, in [10], the credibility-limited revision operators were extended to the belief base context and in [4] to iterated revision.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In [5] Fermé and Hansson proposed an operator that, instead of accepting the new information or rejecting it completely, allows the acceptance of only part of the new information and the rejection of the rest of it. They called this operator selective revision. An operator ⊚ of selective revision is constructed from a partial meet revision operator ⋆ and a transformation function f from {a mathematical formula}L to {a mathematical formula}L as follows: {a mathematical formula}K⊚α=K⋆f(α). Intuitively, f selects the credible part of every sentence. A natural restriction is that {a mathematical formula}f(α) should not contain more information that the one that is contained in α (i.e., {a mathematical formula}⊢α→f(α)). In [5] several other plausible properties that a transformation function may be expected to satisfy were proposed and some representation theorems were presented.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Consolidation was introduced in [17] and consists of making an inconsistent belief base consistent. It can be seen as a contraction by ⊥ (falsum). Consolidation is an operator for belief bases and does not have a plausible counterpart for belief sets. This is due to the fact that there is only a single inconsistent belief set and once it is obtained all distinctions are lost and consolidation can not restore them.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Hansson in [22] proposed a modification of external revision that he designated by semi-revision. Instead of contracting by the negation of a sentence, the expanded set is contracted by ⊥ (falsum). Thus, the semi-revision can be seen as the result of the consolidation of an expansion. We note that in a semi-revision process the input sentence may be removed during the consolidation. Thus semi-revision is a non-prioritized change operator. In [17], [22], Hansson defined and axiomatically characterized operators of kernel and partial-meet consolidation and of kernel and partial meet semi-revision, based in the namesake operators of contraction and revision.

      Conclusion
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Standard contraction operators are always successful, i.e. they are such that the result of contracting a (non-tautological) belief from a given belief base is a new belief base which (is contained in the original one and) does not imply that belief. However, as discussed before, this is not a realistic feature of belief contraction. An agent may have a set of beliefs (not necessarily tautologies) that he/she is not willing to give up independently of the contraction to be performed. The basic idea of shielded contraction is to define a function in two steps. The first step consists of determining which beliefs are suitable to be contracted and which are not, i.e. given a belief, first it is analysed if it belongs to the set of retractable sentences (set of beliefs suitable to be contracted) or not. Afterwards the function should:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="–">
       leave the set of beliefs unchanged when the belief to be contracted is considered irretractable;
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="–">
       behave as a standard contraction when contracting by a retractable belief.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      This kind of operators is useful for modelling the behaviour of a rational agent when it receives some new information that forces the disbelief in one of its current beliefs. In a context where the belief states of an agent are represented by belief bases, a shielded base contraction can be used to obtain the new belief state of the agent, after such an information is received. We notice that by means of this kind of operators it is possible to obtain more realistic models than those that can be obtained using (only) standard contractions, since it is naturally expectable that a rational agent will not always be willing to give up any of its present beliefs even if some external new information compels it to do so.

      The present paper constitutes a thorough study of shielded contractions on belief bases. In Section 3 we presented several results highlighting some direct relations among the postulates satisfied by a shielded contraction function ∼ induced by a standard contraction ÷ and a set of retractable sentences R and the postulates satisfied by ÷ and the properties of the set R. From the conclusions that can be drawn from those results we highlight the two following ones, concerning the postulates of relative success and persistence:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="(i)">
       The shielded base contraction ∼ satisfies relative success if and only if ÷ satisfies failure or the set R satisfies non-retractability of tautology.
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="(ii)">
       If R and ÷ satisfy condition (R - ÷) then ∼ satisfies persistence. Furthermore if {a mathematical formula}R={α:A∼α⊬α} and ∼ satisfies persistence then R and ÷ satisfy condition (R - ÷).
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      We are giving special attention here to the postulates of relative success and persistence since these two postulates can be considered to be the most characteristic (and intuitive) properties of shielded contraction (together with inclusion). On the one hand relative success can be thought of as the most natural weakened version of the success postulate that complies with the idea underlying the notion of shielded contraction. On the other hand, among the postulates here considered to characterize shielded contractions, persistence can be seen as the one that more accurately describes the behaviour that is expected from a shielded contraction.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In this paper we have considered that a reasonable shielded contraction operator should satisfy at least the postulates of inclusion and relative success, and we presented a representation theorem—which is essentially based on the result mentioned in (i) above—for the class of (shielded contraction) operators that satisfy exactly those two postulates. In what concerns persistence, according to (ii) above, in order to assure that the shielded contraction, that is built from a contraction ÷ and a set R, satisfies that postulate, it is enough to impose that R and ÷ satisfy condition (R - ÷).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Sections 4 and 5 contain the other contributions of this paper, namely the proposal and axiomatic characterization of twenty kinds of shielded contractions and the study of the interrelations among all those classes in terms of inclusion. All the shielded contractions considered are defined by means of a base contraction function (of some well known class of such operators) and a certain set R formed by the so-called retractable sentences. Among these classes there are four which are formed by shielded contraction operators that satisfy the above highlighted postulate of persistence.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      By means of the provided results it is possible to predict the behaviour of any of the functions constructed as indicated in each of the definitions presented. On the other hand, it is also possible to use these results in the converse direction, that is, for certain sets of properties that are desirable from a shielded contraction function, our results allow to identify an explicit construction of a function that will satisfy all the properties included in that set.
