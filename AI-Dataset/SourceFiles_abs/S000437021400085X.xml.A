      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Online services offering consumer group discounts represent an important and growing segment of online sales. Despite margin pressures, services such as Groupon, Living Social, and hundreds of others remain successful, offering consumers a choice of multiple, competing offers from vendors of identical or similar products. The move to offering large-scale group discounts is emerging in very sophisticated markets as well, as evidenced by programs in the UK, Australia, and other countries that encourage consumers to engage in coalitional buying activities for electricity, life insurance, and other such products and services.{sup:1} This abundance presents difficult decisions for the buyer, since the optimal purchase depends not only on her preferences, but also on the choices of other buyers (which determine the triggered price); intelligent search and coordination mechanisms allow mediators to assemble large group of buyers in order to take advantage of offered discounts (see Related Work). Vendors too face complex decisions in the face of strategic competitors and buyers (especially when the latter coordinate their purchases using online services): they must decide on a complete pricing strategy, setting volume-based prices instead of a single posted price.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In this paper we assess the value of offering group discounts from the perspective of the vendors, and take some initial steps towards delineating conditions under which such discounts may increase vendor revenue. Our starting point is the group buying model recently proposed by Lu and Boutilier [17]. In this model (henceforth, the LB model), vendors of similar products each propose volume discounts for their product, and buyers each seek a single product from this set. Each buyer has preferences for the distinct products which, together with the final price—as triggered by purchase volume—determine her utility. Lu and Boutilier study various forms of stable assignment of buyers to specific vendors in this model, with and without transferable utility. They also develop algorithms for computing such stable assignments. However, they approach the problem from the perspective of the buying group or buying coalition, modeling the incentives for different buyers to coordinate their purchases with specific vendors. Critically, they take the (volume-discounted) vendor prices to be exogenously determined and fixed (independent of buyer behavior). As such, they do not address the incentives for vendors to offer such discounts in the first-place, nor strategic interactions involving the vendors.

      <list-item label="Incentives for group discounts">
       The discussion above leads to a natural question: why would a vendor offer price discounts based on the number of buyers of its product? There are at least three potential reasons. First, if a vendor has economies of scale (i.e., when the marginal costs of producing a good or offering a service decreases with the number of units sold), at least some of the cost savings induced by unit-sales volume can be passed on to consumers to increase total sales and revenues. Second, there may be implicit or explicit network effects, such as word of mouth advertising, where initial discounts that bring in large volumes of buyers can result in greater additional sales among further buyers at a future point in time. When customer acquisition costs are high through traditional channels, group discounts may induce buyers—in order to extract a better price—to recruit their friends who may be unaware of the product or service being offered.{sup:2} Finally, group discounts may allow for price discrimination between buyers with different preferences. This may be especially true in circumstances in which a vendor is uncertain about the valuations buyers have for her product or service, and can be used to extract more revenue from buyers of different types. While all three factors (and likely several others) play a role in driving volume discounts in real markets, in this work we focus exclusively on the third factor in order to study its effect on pricing strategies in isolation. We do so by assuming that production costs are linear (i.e., there are no economies of scale) and that the set of potential buyers is fixed and aware of all vendor offerings (i.e., there are no advertising or acquisition effects).
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="A two-stage competition">
       Several models have been proposed that examine vendor incentives for offering volume-based discounts under a variety of utility and informational assumptions. We discuss these in depth in Section 1.1. Most such proposals adopt a two-stage model of interaction, along the lines of Stackelberg games, in which one or more vendors first commit to a pricing strategy, or discount schedule, and then buyers make individual or coordinated purchasing decisions. The LB model reflects the coordinated behavior of buyers in the presence of multiple discount schedules, a behavior that has become increasingly feasible using online services (e.g., Groupon, Living Social, Which? Switch) to assess preferences and form suitable buying groups. As such, it is natural to assess its fit within the “standard” two-stage framework, and analyze how such coordinated buyer behavior impacts vendor pricing strategies. Specifically, we analyze the conditions under which a vendor can derive value by using a discount schedule rather than a fixed price.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Since the LB model does not account for the incentives or behavior of vendors, we extend it to include vendors as strategic entities to form a game that reflects the strategic interactions of all participating parties. To do so, we must specify the structure of vendor utility functions, vendor beliefs about buyer valuations, and the relation between the two. We consider three natural models that differ in vendor information structure, each of which is elaborated below. Our complete information model assumes that vendors know the valuations (or types) of all buyers for their products. In our Bayesian model, vendor beliefs take the form of a distribution over buyers' types and the utility of their strategies is determined using the expected response of the buyers to their prices and/or discounts. Finally, we analyze a distribution-free model, where vendors know only the set of possible buyer types, but not the frequency with which they occur. Here they try to maximize worst-case utility over possible realizations of buyer types. Despite the key informational difference, in all models, vendor utility remains linear in the number of units sold. In each setting, we analyze conditions under which a vendor may profit by offering group discounts when competing with other vendors.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      To summarize our model, we study a two-stage game with multiple vendors and multiple buyers. In the first stage, vendors propose price schedules, exploiting available information about buyer types, which varies across the three models. Buyers then coordinate their buying behavior, based on their realized types (if unknown to the vendors), using the LB (non-cooperative) mechanism. Under this non-cooperative model of buyer behavior, buyers have full information about the offers and the types of other buyers, but cannot transfer payments or make binding agreements. Buyers form stable groups (as defined below), where no single buyer can benefit by switching to a different vendor.

       Volume-based pricing has been studied extensively, but often using motivations different than ours. One line of research focuses on the effect of volume discounts on purchase management and the induced efficiencies in supply chains [20], [15], [25]. For instance, quantity discounts can increase order quantities from a single or multiple buyers. Reduced setup, inventory and shipping costs can more than compensate suppliers for their reduced margins, while saving buyers money. The focus of such work is on optimizing pricing, though strategic elements are sometimes assessed. Edelman et al. [8] provide an analysis of group discounts that focuses on the value of discounts for customer acquisition. However, as noted above, we ignore the benefits of non-linear production costs and buyer acquisition in our work.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       A different model was suggested by Anand and Aron [1], with motivations very similar to ours: buyer utility is quasi-linear in price, and vendor utility is linear in the number of units sold (as in our model). Volume discounts are used to attract buyers that would otherwise refrain from purchase. The main difference with our model is their assumption of weak buyer coordination: buyers are uncertain of the valuations of others and do not coordinate their choices. Anand and Aron further limit their analysis to a monopolist (single vendor) and several very specific classes of buyers. Under a variety of conditions, they prove that a monopolist with a fixed marginal production cost cannot increase its profit by posting a discount schedule rather than a fixed price. However, a schedule may be the best strategy for a monopolist, for example, when facing buyers whose types are correlated by some signal that provides some indication of the quality of the product.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Somewhat less related (but still within the two-stage framework) is the group buying auction model [6]. Here a vendor posts a discount schedule, then buyers arrive sequentially and can announce the price at which they are willing to buy (rather than just joining the group). These announcements, in turn, may affect the estimates of other buyers regarding the eventual price, and their decision to join the group. Chen et al. show that a monopolist facing i.i.d. buyers cannot benefit by offering volume discounts unless it is risk-seeking or has decreasing marginal costs. More recently, Chen et al. [7] have shown how to derive the optimal discount schedule for a vendor facing a particular class of (non-i.i.d.) buyers, both as a monopolist and when competing against other (fixed-price) vendors. Other discount-based auction mechanisms have also been developed [19], [22].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The algorithmic aspects of finding a service that is most suitable for a group of buyers (including scenarios with group discounts) have been studied in the AI literature [23], [18], where buyers are assumed to be fully cooperative.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Finally, various stable mechanisms for buyer coordination have been suggested assuming transferable utility[26], [16], [17], which requires the possibility that buyers can construct and engage in binding agreements. In our models, as in [1], [6] and in the non-transferable-utility version of [17], we assume a non-cooperative setting that excludes monetary transfers among buyers, and focus on (one-shot) vendor revenue maximization.

       Outline and contribution
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Our main contribution in this work is an analysis of the impact of buyer coordination (in the LB model) on vendor pricing, in particular, in the presence of competing vendors. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our underlying model, elaborating on the range of buyer behaviors, reviewing the LB model and the behavior it induces within the buying group, and outline the pricing and discounting strategies available to vendors. We begin our analysis in Section 3, showing that with complete information there is no incentive for vendors to use group discounts. We outline the Bayesian (expected utility) model in Section 4, and prove that if buyer valuations are independent and identically distributed, and all other vendors use fixed prices, then fixed prices are optimal for any vendor. However, we show that if any of these conditions is relaxed, then a vendor may benefit by posting a discount schedule rather than a fixed price. With correlated buyers, this gain can grow linearly with the number of buyers. In Section 5, we provide a similar result in the distribution-free setting: a vendor facing buyers with identical sets of possible valuations—with other vendors offering fixed prices—should also post a fixed price in order to minimize regret. We conclude in Section 6 with some suggested future research directions, and offer some preliminary results on equilibrium analysis and ties to optimal auction theory.

      Model and notation
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Assume a set N of n buyers and a set M of m vendors. Vendors each offer a single product for sale, of which they have an “unlimited” supply (enough to satisfy the demands of all buyers). Each buyer i has a type{a mathematical formula}Vi, which is an m-vector of non-negative values, where {a mathematical formula}vij represents i's valuation for j's product. We denote by {a mathematical formula}Ai⊆Rm the set of possible types for buyer i. Each buyer has unit demand: she will buy at most one product from at most one vendor. Let {a mathematical formula}vj denote the vector of values for vendor j (over all {a mathematical formula}i∈N) and {a mathematical formula}V=(vij)i∈N,j∈M be the matrix of all valuations. We can think of {a mathematical formula}(Vi)i∈N as the rows of V, and {a mathematical formula}(vj)j∈M as its columns.{sup:3} The set of all possible type matrices is denoted by {a mathematical formula}A⊆Rn×m. {a mathematical formula}Ai is thus the projection of {a mathematical formula}A over the dimensions relevant to buyer i. Each vendor has a fixed cost {a mathematical formula}cj for producing and/or distributing one unit of its product, which is common knowledge among vendors.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Two-stage interaction
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Vendors and buyers engage as follows: in the first stage of the game, each vendor posts a discount schedule, a non-increasing vector {a mathematical formula}pj:[n]→R+, where {a mathematical formula}pj(t) is the price offered if t buyers each purchase j's item [1]. Let {a mathematical formula}P be the set of all possible discount schedules and {a mathematical formula}P=(p1,…,pm) a profile of schedules, one per vendor. We refer to a schedule with a single fixed price as a trivial schedule, which for simplicity is denoted by {a mathematical formula}pj∈R+.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In the second stage of the game, each buyer selects a single vendor from whom to purchase a product, or decides to abstain from a purchase. We will elaborate the mechanism by which buyers coordinate their purchases—the LB model—below. The selection of vendors can be modeled as an assignment {a mathematical formula}μ:N→M∪{0} of buyers to vendors, where {a mathematical formula}μ(i)=0 reflects the fact that i abstains from purchase. It will be convenient to represent this assignment as a partitioning of the buyers into {a mathematical formula}S=(S0,S1,…,Sm), where {a mathematical formula}Sj=μ−1(j)⊆N is the set of buyers assigned to j (and {a mathematical formula}S0 are the abstainers). An outcome{a mathematical formula}(P,S) of the game comprises a set of schedules {a mathematical formula}P=(pj)j∈M, and a partitioning S. Under a given outcome {a mathematical formula}(P,S), a buyer {a mathematical formula}i∈Sj pays price {a mathematical formula}pj(|Sj|) for any {a mathematical formula}j≠0.

       The Lu–Boutilier model
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       We now define the LB model in more detail. Following Lu and Boutilier [17], we assume buyers are strategic but vendors are not for the purposes of defining buyer behavior, and therefore assume that discount schedules posted by vendors are fixed. This is standard for a two-stage leader-responder game (or Stackelberg game). We will extend this basic setting in Section 2.2 by adding vendor utilities, strategies, and informational assumptions to model the strategic interactions of vendors.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Assume a profile of discount schedules P has been fixed by the vendors. Once buyers are assigned to specific vendors, the item prices are set by {a mathematical formula}(P,S) as defined above. Buyer utility is quasi-linear in price: the utility of {a mathematical formula}i∈Sj is {a mathematical formula}ui(P,S)=vij−pj(|Sj|). For ease of exposition we assume buyers are never indifferent between products (vendors); as such, we assume a predetermined ordering of vendors, specific to each buyer, that is part of its type {a mathematical formula}Vi. This is used to break ties between vendors for whom the buyer otherwise has the same utility.

        Buyer behavior
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        If P consists of fixed prices, every buyer has a strongly dominant strategy (recall we assume strict preferences). However, if one or more vendors post non-trivial discount schedules, the optimal behavior of one buyer may depend on the decisions of other buyers. When considered as a cooperative game where the utilities are either transferable or non-transferable, Lu and Boutilier showed that the core of the game may be empty. That is, there are discount schedules where, given any partitioning of buyers, some coalition of buyers can do better by moving to a different vendor. Thus as in that work, we consider outcomes that are stable to unilateral deviations by buyers from a given outcome.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        We assume that if buyer i switches from vendor {a mathematical formula}j=μ(i) in outcome {a mathematical formula}(P,S) to some other vendor {a mathematical formula}j′, she enjoys the (potentially reduced) price {a mathematical formula}pj′(|Sj′|+1) induced by her deviation. Strong stability requires that no single buyer gains from such a deviation. For any profile of discount schedulesP and type matrix V, there is some partition S that is strongly stable [17]. We refer to such a partition as a stable buyer partition (SBP). An SBP is, in fact, a pure Nash equilibrium in the second stage of our game. However, since our focus is on vendor behavior in this work, we reserve the term equilibrium for analysis of the first stage of the game (i.e., vendor play).
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        We note that there may be multiple SBPs in any game. We generally do not make any assumption about the selected SBP, however in Section 4.2 we will require that it is not Pareto-dominated by another SBP (we term this assumption the undominated SBP assumption). This is a rather weak assumption as it is likely that the SBP is reached with the help of some mediator, cheap-talk, or another mechanism that provides very mild coordination capabilities. From among undominated SBPs, we may select in an arbitrary, pre-defined way. For example, Lu and Boutilier [17] describe a method for finding SBPs that maximize social welfare, which could readily be incorporated into our model.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Nothing in our results depends on the means of selecting the SBP. Thus for every schedule P and type matrix V there is a unique outcome {a mathematical formula}(P,S), where {a mathematical formula}S=S(P,V) is an SBP induced by {a mathematical formula}P,V.

        Example
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        Consider the (second-stage) game among buyers described in Table 1. Suppose that every buyer selects her favorite vendor, ignoring prices and breaking ties lexicographically. Then we obtain the partition {a mathematical formula}S=({a,b},{c}). Under partition S, we have {a mathematical formula}ua(P,S)=ub(P,S)=7−p1(2)=3;uc(P,S)=4−p2(1)=1. S is not an SBP, as buyer c has an incentive to move to vendor 1. Indeed, in the partition {a mathematical formula}S′=({a,b,c},∅) we have {a mathematical formula}uc(P,S′)=3−p1(3)=2&gt;uc(P,S). The partition {a mathematical formula}S′ is an SBP, as no buyer has an incentive to deviate from it.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Note that {a mathematical formula}S′ is not the only SBP. The partition {a mathematical formula}S″ where all buyers go with vendor 2 is also stable. Indeed, if buyer a moves to vendor 1, her utility will drop from {a mathematical formula}3−p2(3)=0 to {a mathematical formula}7−p1(1)=−1, and similarly for b and c. However, {a mathematical formula}S′ is the only Pareto optimal (i.e., undominated) SBP. Thus {a mathematical formula}S′=S(P,V).

       Vendors as agents
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Our focus in this work is on the strategic interactions among vendors. Once they select their prices and/or discount schedules, we assume that buyer behavior is dictated by the (nontransferable utility version of the) LB model above. We now turn our attention to the vendors.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Given an outcome {a mathematical formula}(P,S), the utility of vendor {a mathematical formula}j∈M is simply the revenue derived from the buyers assigned to it less the cost of the products sold: {a mathematical formula}Uj(P,S)=|Sj|⋅(pj(|Sj|)−cj), where {a mathematical formula}cj is the cost of a single product to j. Recall that {a mathematical formula}S(P,V) is the SBP induced by the prices P. This allows us to write {a mathematical formula}Uj(P,V)≡Uj(P,S(P,V)).

        Vendor behavior
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        Since the behavior of the buyers for any set of vendor discount schedules is well-defined, we can confine our analysis of the two-stage game to the first stage, where vendors announce prices. The incentives facing vendors in choosing their strategies depend critically on their knowledge of buyers' types, as well as on their objective function. We consider three different models, which we briefly describe here (formal definitions appear in the sections that follow).
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        In the full information model, vendors know the precise buyer types and act to maximize their utility given the actions of other vendors. The Bayesian (or expected utility) model adopts a standard Bayesian game formulation: vendors have partial information in the form of a commonly-known distribution {a mathematical formula}D over (joint) buyer types, and act to maximize their expected utility, taking expectations over outcomes (SBPs) with respect to possible realizations of buyer types. The strict uncertainty model assumes that vendors posses even less information about the buyers: they know only the possible set of buyer types (i.e., only the support of the distribution is known). In this model, expected utility is ill-defined, so we instead adopt a common approach for such settings and assume vendors try to minimize their worst-case regret over all possible type realizations.

        Best response and equilibrium
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        Informally, an equilibrium is a profile of vendor strategies (i.e., prices or discount schedules) such that no vendor prefers to use a different strategy, assuming that other vendors use their strategy in the profile, and the buyers behave as described above. Equivalently, a profile is not in equilibrium if some vendor has a best response, or alternative strategy, that it (strictly) prefers if other vendors use that profile. (The precise definition of “preferred strategy” depends on the model and how strategies are evaluated.)
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Best responses are in some sense a more fundamental concept than equilibria, since analyzing equilibria depends on full understanding of available best responses. Furthermore, even in settings where we do not expect equilibria to emerge in the repeated interaction among vendors (or in settings where pure strategy equilibria may not exist, depending on the solution concept), an understanding of best-response dynamics provides natural insights into the likely outcomes of a game. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is the nature of vendor best responses to the actions of other vendors, and specifically the circumstances under which it is rational to respond with a non-trivial discount schedule rather than a fixed price. While not a focus of this work, all three models admit natural definitions of a vendor equilibrium, based on the corresponding best-response concept.

      The full information model
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      A game{a mathematical formula}G=〈V,C〉 in the full information model is given by a buyer type matrix {a mathematical formula}V=(vi,j) and vendors costs {a mathematical formula}C=(cj). We will use this simple model to demonstrate a best-response by a vendor. Suppose that {a mathematical formula}c1=c2=0, and consider the example given in Table 1. Since by our assumption, under {a mathematical formula}P,V buyers partition according to the SBP {a mathematical formula}S′ (i.e., all buyers choose vendor 1), the utility of the vendors is {a mathematical formula}U1=3⋅p1(3)=3;U2=0. This outcome is not an equilibrium for the vendors. For example, vendor 2 can change her discount schedule to {a mathematical formula}p2′=(1,1,0), which would result in the SBP {a mathematical formula}S(P′,V)=({a,b},{c}) with {a mathematical formula}U2′=1. Vendor 1 can also post a better schedule, by raising his prices to, say, {a mathematical formula}p1′=(8,6,2). Thus, given the strategy of vendor 2 (or, more generally, all vendors except vendor 1), it is natural to ask what is the best discount schedule that vendor 1 can post.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Proof">
      As it turns out, the full information model is not especially interesting from our perspective. In the full information model, there is always a fixed price{a mathematical formula}pjthat is a best response for vendor j to any strategy profile{a mathematical formula}P−jof the other vendors.If the vendors have full information, then they know exactly which buyer partitions will form given any profile of discounts P. Suppose that vendor j expects to have t buyers under some nontrivial schedule {a mathematical formula}pj. That is, {a mathematical formula}|Sj|=t, where {a mathematical formula}S=S((p−j,pj),V). Then j can post a fixed price {a mathematical formula}pj=pj(t) and induce identical buyer behavior S.Let {a mathematical formula}P⁎=(p−j,pj). To see why S is still an SBP, assume toward a contradiction that some buyer i has a deviation from {a mathematical formula}Sk to {a mathematical formula}Sk′ under prices {a mathematical formula}P⁎. First, {a mathematical formula}pk(|Sk|)=pk⁎(|Sk|). If {a mathematical formula}k′≠j, then {a mathematical formula}pk′(|Sk′∪{i}|)=pk′⁎(|Sk′∪{i}|). If {a mathematical formula}k′=j, then{a mathematical formula} In either case, buyer i would also deviate under prices P, which is a contradiction.  □

     <paragraph>
      This is not altogether surprising: the fact that some uncertainty is required to justify group discounts has previously been demonstrated, albeit in a somewhat different model, by Anand and Aron [1]. As a consequence, volume discounts are of no value when buyer types are known (at least in the one-shot game with a fixed population of buyers).

      The Bayesian model
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      One reason for posting volume discounts rather than fixed prices is to hedge against uncertainty regarding the preferences (hence decisions) of the buyers. Specifically, a vendor can “insure” itself against the possibility that fewer buyers are attracted to its product than expected by using volume discounts. In the Bayesian model we assume that there is some joint distribution over buyers' types {a mathematical formula}D=D(A) which is common knowledge among vendors. The game takes the form {a mathematical formula}G=〈D,C〉. In the first stage of the game, vendors choose discount schedules, not knowing the buyers' types. In the second stage, a type matrix {a mathematical formula}V=(vij)i∈N,j∈M is drawn from {a mathematical formula}D. The goal of vendor j is to set a schedule {a mathematical formula}pj that maximizes its expected utility:{a mathematical formula}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      A special case we consider is the case of i.i.d. buyers, in which {a mathematical formula}Ai=A for all {a mathematical formula}i∈N. In other words, each buyer's type is distributed according to a common distribution {a mathematical formula}Dˆ(A); and {a mathematical formula}D is the corresponding product distribution. We emphasize that within {a mathematical formula}Dˆ(A), buyer i's preferences over different vendors may in fact be probabilistically dependent (i.e., {a mathematical formula}vij and {a mathematical formula}vij′ can be correlated).

       A single vendor
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       First consider the case of a single vendor: suppose a monopolist is faced with distribution {a mathematical formula}D over buyer types. The simple example below demonstrates that a vendor can strictly increase its revenue, relative to any fixed price, using a non-trivial discount schedule. Assume two buyers, and a (discrete) type distribution that assigns probability 0.5 to each of two type matrices, {a mathematical formula}(2,2) and {a mathematical formula}(3,0). Note that buyers' valuations are correlated in {a mathematical formula}D. The optimal fixed price is {a mathematical formula}p=2, which guarantees revenue {a mathematical formula}U(p,D)=0.5⋅2⋅2+0.5⋅2=3 (two buyers in the first realization and one in the second). However, consider a discount schedule with a base price {a mathematical formula}p(1)=3, and a discounted price {a mathematical formula}p(2)=2. Its expected revenue, {a mathematical formula}U(p,D)=0.5⋅2⋅2+0.5⋅3=3.5, is greater than that of the optimal fixed price. More detailed examples are given in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.
      </paragraph>

       We now consider the best response of a vendor to the offers of other vendors. Suppose vendors other than j post discount schedules {a mathematical formula}p−j. The best response of j is:{a mathematical formula} Our main result in the Bayesian model is that, assuming buyer types are independent and drawn from the same distribution, a vendor cannot benefit by using a discount schedule instead of a fixed price unless other vendors also use schedules. Below we show that these conditions are minimal: a non-trivial schedule can be of value if any of these three conditions is relaxed. Let{a mathematical formula}G=〈D,C〉be a game with i.i.d. buyers, which always select an undominated SBP. If all vendors except j post fixed prices, then there is a best response for vendor j that is also a fixed price.W.l.o.g., we analyze the response of vendor 1 to fixed prices of the other vendors. Denote by {a mathematical formula}q2,…,qm the (fixed) prices of all other vendors. Given distribution {a mathematical formula}Dˆ over a single buyer's types (a distribution over vectors of size m), we define the following single parameter distribution {a mathematical formula}Dˆ′:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}≳j should be interpreted as &gt; if a buyer of type v prefers vendor j over 1 in case of a tie, and otherwise as ≥.{sup:4} For instance, in the special case where the buyer always prefers vendor 1, we have {a mathematical formula}Prv∼Dˆ′(v≥x)≡Prv∼Dˆ(v1−max2≤j≤m⁡(vj−qj)≥x).Now, consider vendor 1 to be a monopoly, facing buyers that are sampled from distribution {a mathematical formula}D′ (or, equivalently, each buyer is i.i.d. sampled from {a mathematical formula}Dˆ′). An indifferent buyer (with {a mathematical formula}v=p) always chooses to buy a product from vendor 1 over abstaining from purchase. The vendor can attract k buyers at price p iff there are k buyers for which {a mathematical formula}vi,1≥p. However, for every buyer i,{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} That is, vendor 1, when viewed as a monopolist, will attract the same set of buyers at the same price as in the multi-vendor game. Thus the revenue of any discount schedule p for the single vendor under distribution {a mathematical formula}D′ is equal to the revenue it derives using p when faced with vendors posting prices {a mathematical formula}q2,…,qm under distribution {a mathematical formula}D. One subtle issue is that given pricing {a mathematical formula}p1=p in the multi-vendor game G, there may be several SBPs. However, the stable partition that extracts the best price (i.e., the one where the largest number of buyers select vendor 1, and is also stable) Pareto dominates all other SBPs. Thus according to the undominated SBP assumption {a mathematical formula}S((p1,q2,…,qm),V) is uniquely defined, and {a mathematical formula}S1 coincides with the set of buyers that purchase in the single vendor setting.Finally, by Proposition 2, the best strategy for the vendor is to post a fixed price {a mathematical formula}p⁎, which entails that {a mathematical formula}p⁎=brjEU(q2,…,qm).  □

       There are three main conditions underlying Theorem 3: (a) all buyers have the same marginal distribution of values; (b) buyer valuations are independent; and (c) all other vendors use fixed prices. We now show that these are, in a sense, minimal requirements for the optimality of fixed prices. Specifically, relaxing any of the three admits non-trivial schedules as best responses in some circumstances. For any pair of conditions taken from (a), (b) or (c), there is a game with two vendors and two buyers where the best response of one vendor is a non-trivial discount schedule.

        We first assume conditions (b) and (c) hold, but allow buyers to have different marginal distributions over valuations. Consider a simple counterexample with two vendors {a mathematical formula}M={1,2} and two independent (but not i.i.d.) buyers {a mathematical formula}N={a,b}. Both vendors have zero cost. Buyer a prefers vendor 1: {a mathematical formula}va1=10+x, where {a mathematical formula}x∼U(0,1]; and {a mathematical formula}va2=10. Buyer b prefers vendor 2: {a mathematical formula}vb1=10; and {a mathematical formula}vb2=10+y, where {a mathematical formula}y∼U(0,1].
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Consider the fixed price profile {a mathematical formula}P⁎=(1,1). The expected revenue is {a mathematical formula}U1(P⁎)=U2(P⁎)=1 (in fact this occurs w.p. 1, as every vendor keeps exactly one buyer). We argue that if discounts are not allowed, then {a mathematical formula}P⁎ is an equilibrium, i.e., that no vendor can earn more than 1 by posting a fixed price. Indeed, suppose that vendor 1 announces some price {a mathematical formula}q&gt;1, then it keeps buyer a w.p. {a mathematical formula}(2−q), and{a mathematical formula}

        Our next example shows that relaxing independence, but retaining conditions (a) and (c), also admits discounting as a best response. Consider the previous game, but with probability {a mathematical formula}12, swap the preferences (types) of both buyers. In other words, either: (i) a prefers vendor 1 and b prefers vendor 2 (with the valuations outlined in the previous example); or (ii) b prefers vendor 1 and a prefers vendor 2; and each of (i) and (ii) occurs with probability {a mathematical formula}12. This results in a symmetric distribution, but one that correlates their valuations of buyers a and b. The fixed profile {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1) remains a fixed price equilibrium. Moreover, since the best response of vendor 1 to price 1 is {a mathematical formula}q1=(1,34) regardless of its type, it remains a best response in the new game.

        Lastly, we describe a game with two i.i.d. buyers, maintaining conditions (a) and (b), but where the best response for vendor 1 to a discount schedule posted by vendor 2 is itself a schedule (the full analysis of this example appears in Appendix B). Let {a mathematical formula}va1=vb1=10, {a mathematical formula}va2=10+xa, and {a mathematical formula}vb2=10+xb, where {a mathematical formula}xa and {a mathematical formula}xb are sampled i.i.d. from {a mathematical formula}D=U[−1,1]. As long as prices are not too high (say, below 8) buyer i's decision is determined only by the value difference {a mathematical formula}xi between her value for the two vendors. It is not hard to verify that the best response of every vendor j to the fixed price {a mathematical formula}p−j=1 is {a mathematical formula}pj=1, even if schedules are allowed (i.e., {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1) is an equilibrium, see Section 6.1). However, suppose vendor 2 posts schedule {a mathematical formula}q=(1,0.8). Vendor 1's best response is not a fixed price: it can be shown that its optimal fixed price is {a mathematical formula}p⁎≅0.922, yielding revenue of 0.93656, while the schedule {a mathematical formula}(0.93,0.914) yields slightly higher revenue of 0.93675.

       Revenue bounds
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       As we have seen in the examples in Section 4.3, there are instances in which a vendor derives greater expected revenue by posting a discount schedule rather than a fixed price. It is thus natural to attempt quantify the potential benefit of using volume-based discounts. To simplify the approach, we limit our analysis to a monopolist vendor, and examine the potential increase in utility relative to the optimal fixed price. Our approach and bounds can easily be extended to any number of vendors.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       When faced with n buyers, there are cases where a vendor can increase its profit by a factor of n by using group discounts; that is, the value of using discounts is unbounded as the number of buyers grows. The proof of the following proposition assumes that buyer valuations for the vendor's product are correlated. However, the types of correlations used can occur quite naturally when publicly observable signals (such as product quality, product reviews, or network effects and externalities) influence buyer valuations.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       A vendor's expected utility for using a discount schedule, when faced with n buyers, can be no more than a factor of n greater than the expected utility of the optimal fixed price. Moreover, there are instances where this improvement is realized by a discount schedule.We first prove the upper bound, showing that no discount schedule improves on the optimal fixed price by more than a factor of n. Let p be any discount schedule. Let {a mathematical formula}Bj be the event that price {a mathematical formula}p(j) realized.{a mathematical formula} Thus the expected revenue {a mathematical formula}maxq⁡U(q,D) of the optimal fixed price is at least {a mathematical formula}1n of that of any discount schedule p.We now construct an example that achieves this factor n improvement. Consider n buyers who are uncertain about their valuation of the product, believing it to be of one of n different product types (e.g., the product has one of n different quality levels). Let {a mathematical formula}ε&gt;0 be some constant.A product of type {a mathematical formula}j∈[n] has j buyers who value it at {a mathematical formula}vj=εj−nj, whereas all other buyers value it at 0. Note that when {a mathematical formula}ε=1, the average value of all buyers for every j is 1. We can think of event j as representing the level of detail in a product review: when {a mathematical formula}j=n, no buyer knows anything about the product, so all buyers assign it an expected value of 1. As j decreases, the review becomes more detailed, providing additional information, so that {a mathematical formula}n−j buyers realize they do not want this product, while expected value of other buyers increase.We define {a mathematical formula}Dε so that for each {a mathematical formula}j&lt;n the product is of type j with probability {a mathematical formula}qj=εn−j. With the remaining probability mass {a mathematical formula}qn=1−ε−ε2−⋯−εn−1, the product is of type n. In the best case, the vendor can extract the full surplus under any product type. Note that this can be achieved with the schedule {a mathematical formula}p⁎(j)=vj, thus the optimal schedule {a mathematical formula}p⁎ extracts from any buyer her full expected value:{a mathematical formula} which approaches n as {a mathematical formula}ε→0.Suppose instead that the vendor uses a fixed price. With any fixed price of the form {a mathematical formula}pj=p⁎(j)=vj,j∈[n]—clearly there is no reason to use any other price—the vendor will achieve revenue of:{a mathematical formula} Thus for any n, we can set ε sufficiently small so that the revenue from any fixed price is arbitrarily close to 1, whereas the best discount schedule attracts revenue that approaches n.  □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       What we see is that with such correlations, the vendor can effectively use group discounts to achieve price discrimination, which was impossible in the i.i.d. case. Another interesting question pertains to the maximum utility a vendor can gain by using discounts when facing buyers that are distinct but independent. The first part of Proposition 4 shows that a factor of at least{a mathematical formula}98 improvement is achievable; but it remains an open question as to whether a constant upper bound can be proven.

      The strict uncertainty model
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      The assumption that vendors have distributional knowledge of buyers' types may not be viable in certain situations. In this section, we consider an alternative model of uncertainty, the strict uncertainty model, where vendors know only the possible types that buyers may possess. The game is structured as in the Bayesian model, but rather than sampling buyer types from a distribution, arbitrary types from the type space {a mathematical formula}A1×⋯×An are chosen. This type of game is known variously as a game in informational form[11] or an incomplete information game with strict type uncertainty[12].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In such settings, one plausible objective for vendors is to select a strategy that, given the strategies of other vendors, maximizes its worst-case utility under all possible realizations of buyer types. However, such an approach is inappropriate in our setting. For example, if buyer valuations can fall below a vendor's cost, that vendor's worst-case utility is at most 0, regardless of its actions. We therefore consider a more natural objective, assuming each vendor selects a strategy that minimizes its worst-case or maximum regret over possible buyer types. The minimax regret approach has deep roots in decision making under strict uncertainty [24], has find use in robust optimization [14] and decision support [4], [5], and has been applied in various game-theoretic contexts [12], [2].
     </paragraph>
     <list label="Notation">

       We adapt the definitions of minimax regret of Hyafil and Boutilier [12] to our model. Recall that {a mathematical formula}A⊆Rn×m is the set of possible types for buyers. The possible types {a mathematical formula}Ai⊂Rm for buyer i take the form {a mathematical formula}(vij)j∈M and must occur as a column in some {a mathematical formula}V∈A. It is sometimes useful to think of {a mathematical formula}A as the support of some distribution {a mathematical formula}D, in which case {a mathematical formula}Ai would be the support of the marginal distribution over buyer i's types.

      <list-item>
       Once vendors select strategies (prices) P, suppose that the realized buyer types are given by V. This results in the buyer partition {a mathematical formula}S=S(P,V). We define the regret{a mathematical formula}Regj(P,V) of vendor j relative to this outcome to be the difference between the maximum utility it could have achieved by choosing different prices given this type realization (taking other vendor strategies to be fixed) and its utility given its selected strategy:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}P′=(pj′,p−j). Note that w.l.o.g. the optimal schedule {a mathematical formula}pj′ can be taken to be a fixed price (by Proposition 1).

      <list-item>
       Given their uncertainty about the buyer's types, and without a distribution over these types, we assume vendors assess the utility of a strategy by assuming a type profile realization that maximizes the degree to which that strategy is suboptimal. Specifically, let P be a strategy (pricing) profile, where vendor j uses {a mathematical formula}pj. We define the maximum regret of vendor j to be:{a mathematical formula} The goal of each vendor is the selection of a strategy that minimizes its maximum regret given the strategies of other vendors. We define the minimax best response of vendor j to strategy profile {a mathematical formula}p−j of its competitors to be:{a mathematical formula} Note that maximum regret is minimized with respect to the types of the buyers, not the actions of other vendors, which are assumed to be known. Minimax regret equilibrium can defined in the obvious way using this form of best response [12].

       As in the Bayesian model, we can identify restrictions on the type space {a mathematical formula}A that allow us to derive strong restrictions on the form of best responses. First, we say that the buyer types {a mathematical formula}A are symmetric if {a mathematical formula}Ai=Ai′ for all {a mathematical formula}i,i′∈N; in other words, all buyers have identical sets of possible preferences. We say that buyer types {a mathematical formula}A are independent if {a mathematical formula}A=⨉i∈NAi; in other words, the realization of the type of a buyer does not restrict the possible realizations of any other buyer's type. These notions are related to the i.i.d. assumptions in the Bayesian model. Suppose that {a mathematical formula}A is the support of some unknown distribution {a mathematical formula}D. Clearly if buyers have identical marginals in {a mathematical formula}D then {a mathematical formula}A is symmetric; and if buyers are independent in {a mathematical formula}D then {a mathematical formula}A is also independent. However, the corresponding assumptions on {a mathematical formula}A are much weaker, and may hold even if {a mathematical formula}D does not have independence or identically distributed buyer types.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       If all vendors use fixed prices{a mathematical formula}P=(p1,…,pm), and{a mathematical formula}Ais symmetric and independent, then maximum regret for each vendor is realized when all buyers have the same type.We need to show that if {a mathematical formula}r=Regj(P,V) is vendor j's maximum regret, then there is a type {a mathematical formula}V⁎∈A (which depends on the strategy profile) such that {a mathematical formula}Regj(P,V⁎)≥r, where every row in {a mathematical formula}V⁎ equals to {a mathematical formula}V⁎.We break our analysis into two cases. Suppose first that j's maximum regret is realized by a buyer type profile in which its best response is to ask a lower price than its price {a mathematical formula}pj in P, which by definition must attract more buyers than {a mathematical formula}pj. That is, there is a {a mathematical formula}pj′&lt;pj s.t. {a mathematical formula}|Sj′|&gt;|Sj|, where {a mathematical formula}S′=S(P′,V), {a mathematical formula}P′=(pj′,p−j). Then there is some buyer {a mathematical formula}i∈Sj′∖Sj. Let {a mathematical formula}V⁎=Vi. We now compute the regret at profile P when all buyers are of type {a mathematical formula}V⁎∈A.Denote {a mathematical formula}T=S(P,V⁎) and {a mathematical formula}T′=S(P′,V⁎). Since i prefers vendor j under prices {a mathematical formula}P′, we have that {a mathematical formula}vij−pj′≥vij′−pj′ for all {a mathematical formula}j′≠j. As {a mathematical formula}V⁎=Vi, in the partition {a mathematical formula}T′ all buyers select j, and thus {a mathematical formula}|Tj′|=n≥|Sj′|.Likewise, under prices P, buyer i prefers some other vendor {a mathematical formula}j′ over j, i.e. {a mathematical formula}vij′−pj′≥vij−pj. Thus in T all buyers select {a mathematical formula}j′≠j, and {a mathematical formula}|Tj|=0≤|Sj|.Bringing these inequalities together, we have:{a mathematical formula} In other words, regret is maximized in a type profile in which all buyers have identical valuations.The remaining case is when vendor j's regret is maximized under some profile in which its best response {a mathematical formula}pj′ is to increase its price, potentially losing some buyers, but increasing its margins on those it keeps. Thus {a mathematical formula}pj′&gt;pj, and {a mathematical formula}0&lt;|Sj′|≤|Sj|. (In contrast to the previous case, here we require that {a mathematical formula}pj′ is the optimal price in retrospect.) In this case, there must be a buyer {a mathematical formula}i∈Sj′ of type {a mathematical formula}V⁎=Vi. Again we consider the regret given type matrix {a mathematical formula}V⁎ (where every row equals to {a mathematical formula}V⁎). Since i still prefers j in {a mathematical formula}P′, we have that {a mathematical formula}vij−pj′≥vij′−pj′ for all {a mathematical formula}j′≠j. Thus in {a mathematical formula}T′ all buyers still prefer j, and {a mathematical formula}|Tj′|=n≥|Sj′|. Since {a mathematical formula}pj&lt;pj′, then clearly {a mathematical formula}|Tj|=n as well. As a result:{a mathematical formula} On the other hand,{a mathematical formula} Again regret is maximized when all buyers have the same type.We emphasize that the type {a mathematical formula}V⁎ depends on the profile P, and for every profile there may be a different “worst-case” type.  □

       Our main result in analyzing the strict uncertainty model is similar in spirit to Theorem 3. Let{a mathematical formula}G=〈A,C〉be a game where{a mathematical formula}Ais symmetric and independent.

      <paragraph label="Proof">
       With identical types spaces, we see that discounts provide no value to a vendor if other vendors use fixed prices. However, analogous to the Bayesian model, if the type spaces of some buyers differ from those of others, then the maximum regret of a vendor can be (strictly) minimized by posting a non-trivial schedule. More specifically, as in the expected utility model, if we relax either symmetry or independence, the result above no longer holds. There are discount games in which a vendor minimizes its maximum regret by posting a non-trivial schedule if either (a){a mathematical formula}Ais asymmetric and independent; or (b){a mathematical formula}Ais symmetric and non-independent.We begin with part (a). Consider a game with a single vendor having zero cost and with three buyers. The possible valuations (types spaces) for the buyers are {a mathematical formula}A1=[6,12];A2=A3=[0,6], and {a mathematical formula}A=A1×A2×A3.We first show that the optimal fixed price is {a mathematical formula}p⁎=4, and that {a mathematical formula}MaxReg(4)=8. Clearly {a mathematical formula}p⁎≤6, since for every {a mathematical formula}p&gt;6 the types {a mathematical formula}(6,6,6) lead to a utility of 0, whereas a price of {a mathematical formula}p′=6 would give the maximum possible utility of 18; hence the maximum regret of any {a mathematical formula}p&gt;6 is 18.For every {a mathematical formula}p≤6, the maximum regret is attained for the types {a mathematical formula}v=(p−ε,p−ε,12). Note that {a mathematical formula}U(p,v)=p, whereas {a mathematical formula}U(p−ε,v)=3p−2ε and {a mathematical formula}U(12,v)=12. Thus {a mathematical formula}MaxReg(p)≥Reg(p,v)=max⁡{12−p,3p−2ε−p}≅max⁡{12−p,2p}. The latter term is minimized when {a mathematical formula}12−p=2p, hence for {a mathematical formula}p⁎=4, maximum regret is 8.Next, we show that the schedule {a mathematical formula}p=(6,4,4) has maximum regret of at 6. We consider three cases:

      Discussion
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      We have investigated conditions under which vendors may benefit from posting group or volume discounts for groups of buyers—assuming that buyers can coordinate their purchasing activities—relative to the posting of fixed prices. We showed that, when facing i.i.d. buyers that use the coordination mechanism of Lu and Boutilier [17], complex discount schedules cannot yield greater revenue than that generated using the optimal fixed price. This holds whether vendors know the distribution of buyer types or simply the support of this distribution. This is consistent with similar findings in other models of group buying (see Section 1.1). This robust result highlights the fact that the design of effective pricing schemes for group buying should focus on settings where group discounts provide vendor value, including domains where buyer valuations are correlated by unobservable factors (such as perceived quality or advertising impact), marginal production costs are decreasing, vendors are risk-seeking, or where discounts have viral or long-term acquisition benefits.

      We now outline several directions for future research, with an emphasis on equilibrium analysis and the connection to optimal auctions.

       Vendor equilibria
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       While this paper focused on the structure of a vendor's best-response, natural questions arise regarding to the existence and properties of (pure) Nash equilibria in our model. Since our game has two steps, the appropriate solution concept is a subgame perfect equilibrium.

        Equilibrium concepts
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        Formally, a (pure) subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) of a complete information game {a mathematical formula}G=〈V,C〉 is a profile of discount schedules {a mathematical formula}P∈Pm such that no vendor j prefers {a mathematical formula}S=S(P,V) over {a mathematical formula}S′=S((p−j,pj′),V), for any {a mathematical formula}pj′∈P. A fixed subgame perfect equilibrium (FSPE) in G is defined similarly, with the exception that only trivial (fixed price) schedules are allowed. Note that an FSPE is neither a special case nor more general than an SPE since the restriction applies both the profile P and to the deviation {a mathematical formula}pj′. However, by Proposition 1, the existence of an SPE in the full information model entails the existence of an FSPE with the same utilities for each vendor; and any FSPE is also an SPE in the full information model.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        To illustrate, consider a game with two vendors (with zero costs), and two buyers. Buyer a has preferences {a mathematical formula}va=(3,1) (i.e., a prefers vendor 1), whereas {a mathematical formula}vb=(1,3). The fixed profile {a mathematical formula}P=(3,3) (i.e., {a mathematical formula}p1=3,p2=3) is an FSPE. Each vendor has utility {a mathematical formula}Ui=3. Any {a mathematical formula}pi′&gt;3 will result in a utility of 0, whereas setting the price low enough to attract both buyers will result in a utility of at most 2.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        When we consider the more complex models of partial information, we can construct similar definitions of SPE and FSPE using the already-defined concepts of best response. For example, in the Bayesian model P is an SPE in the game {a mathematical formula}G=〈D,C〉 if {a mathematical formula}pj∈brjEU(pj,G) for all {a mathematical formula}j∈M. Due to Theorem 3, Theorem 7, we know that under an i.i.d. distribution any FSPE in the Bayesian/Distribution-free model is also an SPE. However, this does not hold when the distribution is not i.i.d.: in the examples described in proof of Proposition 4(a) and (b), the fixed profile {a mathematical formula}P⁎=(1,1) is an FSPE but not an SPE. Also note that the existence of an SPE does not entail the existence of an FSPE, since the best response to a discount schedule might not be a fixed price (see Proposition 4(c)).

        A game with no pure equilibrium
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        It is interesting to note that, in general, a (pure) SPE/FSPE may not exist at all—even in the complete information model and even when discounts are forbidden.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        We now describe an example with two vendors and four buyers with known types that does not admit an FSPE (and by Proposition 1, no SPE). Buyer types are: {a mathematical formula}a1=(9,0);a2=(0,9);b1=b2=(5,5). Buyer {a mathematical formula}bi, {a mathematical formula}i∈{1,2}, has a weak preference to vendor i in the case of a tie. Both vendors have zero cost. It can be verified by detailed case analysis that given any fixed price profile {a mathematical formula}P=(p1,p2) there is at least one vendor who would raise or lower her price to improve her utility.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Let {a mathematical formula}x,y be the fixed prices offered by vendors 1 and 2, respectively. We break our analysis into several cases, and show in each that at least one vendor can increase her utility by changing her price.

        Intuitively, the market can be understood as follows. Each vendor has some “core buyers” ({a mathematical formula}a1,a2 in our example), and “flexible buyers” that have no vendor preference and are influenced only by price ({a mathematical formula}b1,b2). Suppose we start from a state where both prices are high. The vendors compete for the flexible buyers by lowering prices, until at some point it is more worthwhile to one of the vendors (say 1) to opt out of the competition. Then vendor 1 increases the price, keeping only its core buyers. Now vendor 2 can also raise its price since there is no competition, and we are back in the start state.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Developing conditions under which pure SPE and FPSE exist is of great interest, especially in cases where all vendors use group discounts.

       Group discounts and optimal auctions
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In his seminal study on optimal auctions, Myerson [21] characterized truthful auction mechanisms, showing that when a seller with a single good faces i.i.d. buyers, the optimal mechanism is effectively a second-price auction with a fixed reserve price. In a related analysis of a model closer to our model, Goldberg et al. [10] show that the worst-case revenue of using a fixed price to sell digital goods (i.e., unlimited supply) is at least as great as that any other truthful “auction” mechanism. They also provided bounds on the revenue attainable by such a mechanism when compared to a variety of benchmarks, which later became standard in the literature.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Consider the following auction rule that sets a price for bidder i, when submitted bids are {a mathematical formula}(b1,…,bn): “if there are at least {a mathematical formula}k−1 other bidders s.t. {a mathematical formula}bj≥p(k), then allocate an item to i for a price of {a mathematical formula}pi=q(k)”. Clearly the outcome of such an auction is equivalent to the outcome of posting the discount schedule q. Moreover, the allocation rule is monotone in the bid, and the price {a mathematical formula}pi is independent of {a mathematical formula}bi. Thus according to Myerson, this auction is truthful. While the Goldberg et al. paper does not deal with a Bayesian setting, it is known that the result still holds when bidder valuations are sampled i.i.d. from some distribution.

       Other directions

      <paragraph>
       Within our current model, further research is needed to understand the full impact of group discounts when buyer valuations are correlated by signals—such as product quality, vendor reputation, or advertising.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Even for a monopolist, the question of computing optimal discount schedules (given a correlated distribution over buyer types) is non-trivial. When facing competing vendors the problem becomes even more complex. It is therefore important to identify natural classes of distributions where optimal or near-optimal schedules can be computed efficiently.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Another interesting question is what to expect when buyers use stronger coordination mechanisms, such as those that allow transferable utility[26], [17]. We conjecture that our main result about the optimality of a fixed price when buyers are i.i.d. still holds under different variations such as transferable utility.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Network externalities is the common name for the phenomenon where buyers assign utility to sharing a vendor or a service (such as a cellular provider or online social network) [13], [3], [9]. One way to think of group discounts is in terms of adding indirect network externalities to the interaction among buyers—the interactions are indirect in the sense that they mediated by the vendors (or by arbitrators of buying groups) and depend on vendor strategies, with the buyers themselves potentially even unaware of the choices of other buyers. Incorporating network structure into our model of group discounts may also be very relevant, as such structure may determine which groups of buyers are able or are likely to coordinate—especially in the context of transferable utility.

     Proof of Proposition 2
     <paragraph>
      W.l.o.g., the optimal fixed price {a mathematical formula}p⁎ can be set deterministically (i.e., randomized pricing cannot do better). Let {a mathematical formula}r⁎=p⁎PrD(v&gt;p⁎) be the optimal expected revenue that can be extracted from a single buyer. Applying the optimal fixed price {a mathematical formula}p⁎ to all n buyers gives an expected revenue of {a mathematical formula}nr⁎.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Assume, by way of contradiction, that some discount schedule {a mathematical formula}p=(p(1),…,p(n)) yields strictly greater revenue than {a mathematical formula}nr⁎. Let {a mathematical formula}ri be the expected revenue extracted from buyer i using p. Then {a mathematical formula}∑iri&gt;nr⁎, i.e., there is at least one buyer (w.l.o.g. assume buyer n) s.t. {a mathematical formula}rn&gt;r⁎. We now construct a pricing strategy that yields revenue {a mathematical formula}rn from buyer n. Independently sample {a mathematical formula}n−1 values from {a mathematical formula}D, simulating the first {a mathematical formula}n−1 buyers, and sort values so that {a mathematical formula}v1≥⋯≥vn−1. Now select price {a mathematical formula}p(1) iff {a mathematical formula}v1&lt;p(1), {a mathematical formula}p(2) iff {a mathematical formula}v2&lt;p(2)≤v1, and more generally {a mathematical formula}p(k) iff {a mathematical formula}vk&lt;p(k)≤vk−1. These events are pairwise disjoint and cover the entire event space (since the union of events 1 to k holds iff least {a mathematical formula}n−k buyers have values below {a mathematical formula}p(k)).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Let {a mathematical formula}Ak denote the kth event, and {a mathematical formula}Bk the corresponding event when actual buyer values are drawn from {a mathematical formula}Dn−1. Clearly {a mathematical formula}Pr(Ak)=Pr(Bk). Moreover, when {a mathematical formula}Bk occurs, exactly{a mathematical formula}k−1 buyers have value at least {a mathematical formula}p(k). Thus buyer n purchases iff {a mathematical formula}vn≥p(k) as well, and pays {a mathematical formula}p(k) if so. However, this is exactly the purchase probability and price paid by a single buyer when the proposed price is {a mathematical formula}p(k). Thus the revenue is {a mathematical formula}∑k=1nPr(Ak)Pr(v≥p(k)|Ak)p(k) (from the single buyer), i.e.,{a mathematical formula} Thus p extracts more than {a mathematical formula}r⁎ from a single buyer (a contradiction).

       Lastly, we describe a game with two i.i.d. buyers (i.e. holding conditions (a), (b)), where the best response to a schedule posted by vendor 2 is also a schedule.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       We recall the definitions from the main text. Both buyers have {a mathematical formula}va1=vb1=10. The preference for vendor 2 is {a mathematical formula}va2=10+xa;vb2=10+xb, where {a mathematical formula}xa and {a mathematical formula}xb are sampled i.i.d. from {a mathematical formula}D=U[−1,1]. Note that as long as prices are not too high (say, below 8) the decision of buyers is determined only by the difference between preference to vendor 1 and to vendor 2, i.e. by the values {a mathematical formula}xa and {a mathematical formula}xb. The profile{a mathematical formula}P=(1,1)is an FSPE. The expected revenue in P is 1 to each vendor.Clearly in P each vendor gets every buyer w.p. {a mathematical formula}12. Thus {a mathematical formula}Ui(P,D)=12⋅1+12⋅1=1. Suppose that vendor 2 switches to {a mathematical formula}p2′≠p2=1. For any {a mathematical formula}2&gt;p2′&gt;0, the revenue from each buyer is {a mathematical formula}p2′pr(xib&gt;p2′−1). Thus{a mathematical formula} For {a mathematical formula}p2′∉[0,2] the revenue is even lower, thus {a mathematical formula}p2=br2EU(p1). The same analysis holds for vendor 1, thus {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1) is an FSPE.  □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       Suppose that vendor 2 posts the schedule{a mathematical formula}q=(1,0.8). Then the best response of vendor 1 is not a fixed price.Denote the strategies of vendors 1 and 2 by {a mathematical formula}p=(p,p′) and {a mathematical formula}q=(q,q′), respectively. The revenue of vendor 1 can be written as a function of p and q. The prices divide the type space (and thus the probability space) to 9 regions as follows.In each cell we know exactly how many buyers bought from vendor 1 and at what price. It remains to compute the probability of each cell. We denote the rows by {a mathematical formula}T=top, {a mathematical formula}M=med, {a mathematical formula}B=bottom, and the columns by {a mathematical formula}L=left, {a mathematical formula}M=med, {a mathematical formula}R=right. We assume that in the middle cell MM both buyers select the same vendor, with equal probability to each vendor.When the maximal distance between prices is no more than 1,{a mathematical formula} Now, suppose that vendor 2 posts the schedule {a mathematical formula}q=(1,0.8). Using the formula, it can be verified that the best fixed response to q (i.e. under the constraint {a mathematical formula}p′=p) is {a mathematical formula}p⁎≅0.922, which yields a revenue of {a mathematical formula}U1((p⁎,q),D)≅0.93656. However, the schedule {a mathematical formula}p=0.93,p′=0.914 yields a slightly higher revenue of 0.93675.
