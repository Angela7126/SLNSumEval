      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      The area of belief change studies how an agent may modify its beliefs given new information about its environment. The best-known approach to belief change is the AGM paradigm [1], [16], named after the original developers. This work focussed on belief revision, in which new information is incorporated into an agent's belief corpus, as well as belief contraction, in which an agent may reduce its set of beliefs. The AGM approach addresses belief change at an abstract level, in which an agent's beliefs are characterised by belief sets or deductively closed sets of sentences, and where the underlying logic includes classical propositional logic. In this approach to revision, a set of rationality postulates is given which arguably any revision function should satisfy. As well, a semantic construction of revision functions has been given, in terms of a total preorder over possible worlds, called a faithful ranking[18]. These syntactic and semantic approaches have been shown to capture the same set of revision functions.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In this paper we address AGM-style belief revision in the language of Horn clauses, where a Horn clause can be expressed as a rule of the form {a mathematical formula}a1∧a2∧⋯∧an→a for {a mathematical formula}n≥0, and where a, {a mathematical formula}ai{a mathematical formula}(1≤i≤n) are atoms, and a is an atom or the constant falsum ⊥. (Thus, expressed in conjunctive normal form, a Horn clause is a clause with at most one positive literal.) In our approach, an agent's beliefs are represented by a Horn clause belief set, and the input is a Horn formula, consisting of a conjunction of Horn clauses. It proves to be the case that AGM-style belief revision doesn't transfer directly to Horn knowledge bases. On the one hand, in the Horn case the AGM postulate set is unsound with respect to faithful rankings over possible worlds. On the other hand, given a Horn revision function that satisfies the AGM postulates, there may be no corresponding faithful ranking that captures the revision function or, alternately, there may be several faithful rankings that capture the function.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Nonetheless, we show that the AGM approach can be extended to the Horn case naturally and satisfactorily. On the semantic side, we impose a “well-behaved” condition on faithful rankings, expressing that a ranking must be coherent with respect to Horn revision. We call such rankings Horn compliant. On the syntactic, postulational, side, we add a postulate to the standard suite of AGM postulates. Interestingly, in the AGM approach this additional postulate is redundant, in that it follows as a theorem from the other AGM postulates. In the Horn case, in which the language is less expressive than in the classical case, this postulate is independent of the others. Given these adjustments to the AGM approach, we then prove a representation result, showing that the class of Horn revision functions conforming to the extended postulate set is the same as those capturable by Horn compliant faithful rankings. Moreover, we prove Horn revision, as modelled herein, is consistent with Darwiche and Pearl postulates for iterated revision [8] and with Parikh's postulate for relevance [22]. A final contribution of our work is the development of two specific Horn revision operators, called basic Horn revision and canonical Horn revision, with polynomial time complexity ({a mathematical formula}O(n) and {a mathematical formula}O(n2log⁡n) respectively).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      This topic is interesting for several reasons. It sheds light on the theory of belief change, in that it weakens the assumption that the underlying logic contains propositional logic. In doing so, it shows that the AGM approach is more generally applicable than perhaps originally believed. That is, our results provide a broadening of the AGM approach to include Horn reasoning, and not just a modification of the AGM approach to accommodate Horn reasoning. Horn clauses are a very useful restriction of classical logic, and have found widespread application in artificial intelligence and database theory. As well, results here may also be relevant to belief change in description logics, a topic that has also received recent attention.

      The next section gives basic notation and definitions used in the paper. The third section introduces belief change and related work that has been carried out in belief change in Horn clause reasoning. This is followed by a discussion of issues that arise in Horn clause belief revision (Section 4). Section 5 develops the approach, and in particular presents the representation result for Horn formula revision. Section 6 discusses iterated Horn revision, while Section 7 discusses relevance and Horn revision, and Section 8 introduces specific Horn revision operators and examines their computational complexity. The paper concludes with a discussion of future work and a brief conclusion.

      Formal preliminaries
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      We introduce here the terminology that we will use in the rest of the paper. {a mathematical formula}P={a,b,c,…} is a finite set of propositional variables. {a mathematical formula}LH denotes the Horn formula language over {a mathematical formula}P∪{⊥}. That is, {a mathematical formula}LH is the least set given by:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="1.">
       {a mathematical formula}a1∧a2∧⋯∧an→a is a Horn clause, where {a mathematical formula}n≥0 and a, {a mathematical formula}ai∈P∪{⊥} for {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤n.If {a mathematical formula}n=0 then →a is also written a, and is a fact.
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="2.">
       If ϕ is a Horn clause then (ϕ) is a Horn formula.
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="3.">
       If ϕ and ψ are Horn formulas then so is {a mathematical formula}(ϕ∧ψ).
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      In our approach, we deal exclusively with Horn formulas, and so formula will refer to a Horn formula; the only exception is when we discuss background work, in which case the context is clear. Formulas are denoted by lower case Greek letters; sets of formulas are denoted by upper case Greek letters. Parentheses are required in 2 above to distinguish, for example {a mathematical formula}(p∧q→r) from {a mathematical formula}(p)∧(q→r). Nonetheless we freely drop parentheses when the meaning is clear.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      An interpretation w is a subset of {a mathematical formula}P, where {a mathematical formula}a∈w means that a is assigned true in w and {a mathematical formula}a∉w means that a is assigned false in w. Occasionally we will explicitly list negated atoms in an interpretation; for example for {a mathematical formula}P={p,q} the interpretation {a mathematical formula}{p} will sometimes be written {a mathematical formula}{p,¬q} or more briefly {a mathematical formula}pq¯. The symbol ⊥ is always assigned false. {a mathematical formula}M is the set of interpretations or (possible) worlds (we use these terms interchangeably). Sentences of {a mathematical formula}LH are true or false in an interpretation according to the standard rules in propositional logic. Truth of ϕ in w is denoted {a mathematical formula}w⊨ϕ. As well, for {a mathematical formula}W⊆M, {a mathematical formula}W⊨ϕ iff for every {a mathematical formula}w∈W, {a mathematical formula}w⊨ϕ. For formula ϕ, {a mathematical formula}[ϕ] is the set of models of ϕ. For set of worlds W, {a mathematical formula}tH(W) denotes the set of formulas satisfied by all worlds in W, i.e.{a mathematical formula} Note that this means that {a mathematical formula}tH(∅)=LH.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      {a mathematical formula}Γ⊢ϕ iff ϕ is derivable from the set of formulas Γ. Again, members of Γ and ϕ are Horn, and ⊢ is defined in terms of Horn formulas; see [12] for details. {a mathematical formula}ψ⊢ϕ is an abbreviation for {a mathematical formula}{ψ}⊢ϕ, and {a mathematical formula}ψ≡ϕ is logical equivalence, i.e. {a mathematical formula}ψ⊢ϕ and {a mathematical formula}ϕ⊢ψ. This extends in the obvious fashion to sets of formulas. For a set of formulas Γ, the closure of Γ under Horn derivability is denoted {a mathematical formula}CnH(Γ). A (Horn) theory H is a set of formulas such that {a mathematical formula}H=CnH(H), also referred to as a belief set. {a mathematical formula}H is the set of Horn theories. For theory H and formula ϕ,{a mathematical formula} is the expansion of H. {a mathematical formula}H⊥=LH is the inconsistent belief set.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Models of Horn formulas are distinguished by the fact that they are closed under intersection of positive atoms in an interpretation. That is:{a mathematical formula} Note that the converse is also true; i.e., if a set of models W is closed under intersection of positive atoms in an interpretation, then there is a Horn formula ϕ such that {a mathematical formula}[ϕ]=W.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      A (partial) preorder ⪯ is a reflexive, transitive binary relation. A total preorder is a partial preorder such that {a mathematical formula}w1⪯w2 or {a mathematical formula}w2⪯w1 for every {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2. The strict part of the preorder ⪯ is denoted by ≺, that is, {a mathematical formula}w1≺w2 just if {a mathematical formula}w1⪯w2 and {a mathematical formula}w2⪯̸w1. As usual, {a mathematical formula}w1≈w2 abbreviates {a mathematical formula}w1⪯w2 and {a mathematical formula}w2⪯w1. Finally, for a set of interpretations {a mathematical formula}W⊆M, we define the set {a mathematical formula}min⁡(W,⪯) by{a mathematical formula}

       Belief revision
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In the AGM approach to belief change [1], [16], beliefs of an agent are modelled by a deductively closed set of formulas, or belief set. Thus a belief set is a set of formulas K such that {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(K), where {a mathematical formula}Cn(K) denotes the closure of K under classical logical consequence. It is assumed that the underlying logic contains classical propositional logic. Belief revision is modelled as a function from a belief set K and a formula ϕ to a belief set {a mathematical formula}K′ such that ϕ is believed in {a mathematical formula}K′, i.e. {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K′. Since ϕ may be inconsistent with K, and since it is desirable to maintain consistency whenever possible (i.e. whenever ϕ is consistent) then some formulas may need to be dropped from K before ϕ can be consistently added. Formally, a revision operator ⁎ maps a belief set K and formula ϕ to a revised belief set {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ. The AGM postulates for revision specify conditions that arguably should hold for any rational revision operator. These postulates can be expressed as follows, where {a mathematical formula}≡PC and {a mathematical formula}+PC stand for logical equivalence and expansion, respectively, in classical propositional logic.
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item>
        {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ=Cn(K⁎ϕ)
       </list-item>
       <list-item>
        {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K⁎ϕ
       </list-item>
       <list-item>
        {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ⊆K+PCϕ
       </list-item>
       <list-item>
        If {a mathematical formula}¬ϕ∉K then {a mathematical formula}K+PCϕ⊆K⁎ϕ
       </list-item>
       <list-item>
        {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ is inconsistent only if ϕ is inconsistent
       </list-item>
       <list-item>
        If {a mathematical formula}ϕ≡PCψ then {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ=K⁎ψ
       </list-item>
       <list-item>
        {a mathematical formula}K⁎(ϕ∧ψ)⊆K⁎ϕ+PCψ
       </list-item>
       <list-item>
        If {a mathematical formula}¬ψ∉K⁎ϕ then {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ+PCψ⊆K⁎(ϕ∧ψ)
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       Thus, the result of revising K by ϕ yields a belief set in which ϕ is believed ((K*1), (K*2)); whenever the result is consistent, the revised belief set consists of the expansion of K by ϕ ((K*3), (K*4)); the only time that K is inconsistent is when ϕ is inconsistent ((K*5)); and revision is independent of the syntactic form of the formula for revision ((K*6)). The last two postulates deal with the relation between revising by a conjunction and expansion: whenever consistent, revision by a conjunction corresponds to revision by one conjunct and expansion by the other. Motivation for these postulates can be found in [16], [25]. We shall call any function ⁎ that satisfies (K*1)–(K*8) an AGM revision function.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 1">
       Katsuno and Mendelzon [18] have shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for constructing an AGM revision operator is that there is a function that associates a total preorder on the set of possible worlds with any belief set K, as follows:{sup:1}(See [18].) A faithful assignment is a function that maps each belief set K to a total preorder {a mathematical formula}⪯K on {a mathematical formula}M such that for any possible worlds {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="1.">
        If {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2∈[K] then {a mathematical formula}w1≈Kw2.
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="2.">
        If {a mathematical formula}w1∈[K] and {a mathematical formula}w2∉[K], then {a mathematical formula}w1≺Kw2.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 1">
       The resulting preorder is referred to as a faithful ranking associated with K. Intuitively, {a mathematical formula}w1⪯Kw2 if {a mathematical formula}w1 is at least as plausible as {a mathematical formula}w2. Katsuno and Mendelzon then provide the following representation result, where {a mathematical formula}t(W) is the set of formulas of classical logic true in the set of possible worlds W: (See[18].) A revision operator * satisfies postulates (K*1)–(K*8) iff there exists a faithful assignment that maps each belief set K to a total preorder{a mathematical formula}⪯Ksuch that{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Thus the revision of K by ϕ is characterised by those models of ϕ that are most plausible according to the agent. Given that we are working with a finite language, this construction is in fact equivalent to the earlier system of spheres approach due to Grove [17]. It is easier to present our results in terms of faithful assignments, and so we do so here.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Another form of belief change in the AGM approach is belief contraction, in which an agent's beliefs decrease. Thus in the contraction of ϕ from K, written {a mathematical formula}K−ϕ, one has {a mathematical formula}ϕ∉K−ϕ⊆K, while ¬ϕ is not necessarily believed. There are two primary means of constructing contraction functions. Using remainder sets, a contraction {a mathematical formula}K−ϕ is defined in terms of maximal subsets of K that fail to imply ϕ. Via epistemic entrenchment, an ordering is defined on sentences of K, and a contraction {a mathematical formula}K−ϕ is (roughly) defined in terms of the most entrenched set of sentences that does not imply ϕ. Of interest, and pertinent to the approach at hand, these various constructions are all in a certain sense interdefinable, as are revision and contraction functions. Hence, given a contraction function −, one may define a revision function by the so-called Levi identity:{a mathematical formula} See [16], [25] for details.

      <paragraph>
       Earlier work on belief change involving Horn formulas dealt with the Horn fragment of a propositional theory, rather than Horn clause belief change as a distinct phenomenon. For example, the complexity of specific approaches to revising knowledge bases is addressed by Eiter and Gottlob [14], including the case where the knowledge base and formula for revision are Horn formulas. Liberatore [20] considers the problem of compact representation for revision in the Horn case. Given a knowledge base K and formula ϕ, both Horn, the main problem considered is whether a revised knowledge base can be expressed by a propositional formula whose size is polynomial with respect to the sizes of K and ϕ. More recently, belief revision in other fragments of propositional logic, including Krom and affine formulas, has been addressed in [6].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Langlois et al. [19] approach the study of revising Horn formulas by characterizing the existence of a complement of a Horn consequence; such a complement corresponds to the result of a contraction operator. This work may be seen as a specific instance of a general framework developed by Flouris et al. [15].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The main difference between our work and the above approaches to revision, is that in our approach revision functions always produce Horn theories (they are postulated to do so). This of course adds an extra burden to the revision process since it now needs to comply with both the principle of minimal change (see [16], [25]), and the requirement to produce Horn theories (which in this context can be seen as an instance of the principle of categorical matching). Our results show that, with some adjustments to the original AGM framework, this double objective can indeed be achieved.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       With respect to AGM-style belief change in Horn theories, most work has focussed on Horn contraction. Delgrande and Pearl [12] addresses maxichoice belief contraction in Horn clause theories, where contraction is defined in terms of remainder sets. Booth et al. [2] generalise this to so-called infra-remainder sets, while Delgrande and Wassermann [11] link Horn contraction to AGM contraction via weak remainder sets. In a series of papers, Zhuang and Pagnucco [29], [30], [31] and Booth et al. [3] further explore Horn contraction by considering other constructions including epistemic entrenchment, partial meet, and kernel contraction. Zhuang et al. [32] present a technique for obtaining a Horn revision in terms of contraction. The difficulty in any approach to defining Horn revision in terms of contraction is that one must deal with the negation of a Horn formula which, in general, is not Horn. Zhuang et al. circumvent this difficulty by contracting by a sequence of Horn strengthenings [28] of the negation of the formula for revision.

       As well, faithful assignments can be defined for the Horn case, basically by changing notation:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 2">
       A faithful assignment is a function that maps each Horn theory H to a total preorder {a mathematical formula}⪯H on {a mathematical formula}M such that for any possible worlds {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2:

      <list>
       <list-item label="1.">
        If {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2∈[H] then {a mathematical formula}w1≈Hw2.

       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       The resulting preorder is referred to as the faithful ranking associated with H. Finally, one can define a function ⁎ in terms of a faithful ranking by:{a mathematical formula} The use of ⁎ in Eq. (2) is suggestive; ideally one would next establish a correspondence between functions that satisfy the postulates and those that can be specified via Eq. (2). However, there are significant difficulties in immediately establishing such a representation result. We review these problems next, and then present our solution in the following section.

       Problems with naïve AGM Horn revision

      <paragraph>
       While Horn revision is naturally expressible in terms of the (Horn) AGM postulates on the one hand, and faithful assignments on the other, it is perhaps not surprising that results differ from revision with respect to classical logic. Below we review some issues that arise, ranging from the inconvenient to the highly problematic.

        Interdefinability results do not hold in Horn belief change
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        As mentioned in Section 3.1, in the AGM approach revision may be defined in terms of contraction via the Levi Identity (1). However, previous work [10] suggests that Horn contraction is unsuitable for specifying a revision operator. As well, if one considers the Levi Identity, revision by a Horn formula ϕ is defined in terms of the contraction by ¬ϕ. Since ϕ is a conjunction of Horn clauses, ¬ϕ in general will not be Horn, and so the Levi identity would seem to be inapplicable for Horn theories.{sup:2}
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        These points are not definitive (there is, after all, no formal result stating an impossibility of interdefinability of Horn contraction and revision), but they do suggest the overall difficulty in obtaining such a result. Consequently, we focus on a direct definition of Horn revision, in terms of ranking functions, in the next section. Having developed such an approach, we then suggest that the relation between Horn contraction and revision is a suitable and interesting topic for future research.

In particular, there is no way in which the relative ranking of worlds {a mathematical formula}pq¯ and {a mathematical formula}p¯q can be distinguished. This is because any Horn formula ϕ consistent with {a mathematical formula}pq¯ and {a mathematical formula}p¯q is also consistent with {a mathematical formula}pq¯ (i.e. if {a mathematical formula}pq¯,p¯q∈[ϕ] then {a mathematical formula}pq¯∈[ϕ]).

It can be observed that the “missing” interpretation is given by {a mathematical formula}pqr¯, where in our ordering (6) we have {a mathematical formula}p¯qr¯≈pqr¯≺pqr¯.

        The function ⁎ induced viaDefinition 2from the binary relation ≺ ofFig. 1satisfies (H*1)–(H*8).

       <paragraph label="Proof">
        Postulates (H*1), (H*2), (H*3), (H*4), and (H*6) follow trivially from Definition 2. For (H*5), it suffices to show that any nonempty set of worlds S which is closed under intersection (and therefore is definable by a Horn formula), has a minimal element with respect to the pseudo-preorder ≺. If S is a subset of {a mathematical formula}M−{p¯qr} this is indeed the case since, as it can be easily observed, the restriction of ≺ to {a mathematical formula}M−{p¯qr} is a total preorder (the problematic cycle {a mathematical formula}pqr¯≺p¯qr≺pq¯r≺pqr¯ is no longer present). In fact, the restriction of ≺ to {a mathematical formula}M−{p¯qr} is not only a total preorder; it is a linear preorder, and therefore if {a mathematical formula}S⊆M−{p¯qr}, S has a unique minimal element. The same of course is true in the case where {a mathematical formula}S⊆M−{pq¯r} or {a mathematical formula}S⊆M−{pqr¯}. This leaves us with the case where {a mathematical formula}{p¯qr,pq¯r,pqr¯}⊆S. Recall that we are only interested in sets S that are closed under intersection, since only for such sets is there a Horn formula ϕ such that {a mathematical formula}[ϕ]=S. Notice however that if S is closed under intersection, and all three worlds {a mathematical formula}p¯qr, {a mathematical formula}pq¯r, and {a mathematical formula}pqr¯ belong to S, then {a mathematical formula}pqr¯ also belongs to S and therefore, by the definition of ≺, {a mathematical formula}pqr¯ is the (unique) minimal element of S. Hence we have shown that any nonempty, closed under intersection, set of worlds S has a (unique) minimal element with respect to ≺. From this, (H*5) trivially follows.For (H*7) and (H*8), consider any two Horn formulas {a mathematical formula}ϕ,ψ. If ϕ is inconsistent with {a mathematical formula}CnH(pqr¯)⁎ψ then (H*7) and (H*8) are trivially true. Assume therefore that ϕ is consistent with {a mathematical formula}CnH(pqr¯)⁎ψ, or equivalently with {a mathematical formula}tH(min⁡([ψ],≺)). Moreover, notice that {a mathematical formula}min⁡([ψ],≺) is a singleton.{sup:4} Hence from our assumption that ϕ is consistent with {a mathematical formula}tH(min⁡([ψ],≺)) it follows that the unique minimal ψ-world also satisfies ϕ. Therefore {a mathematical formula}min⁡([ψ],≺)=min⁡([ψ∧ϕ],≺) and consequently {a mathematical formula}(CnH(pqr¯)⁎ψ)+ϕ=CnH(pqr¯)⁎ψ=CnH(pqr¯)⁎(ψ∧ϕ). Thus (H*7) and (H*8) are true.  □

       <paragraph>
        Although (H*1)–(H*8) are satisfied by a function induced from a non-preorder, the connection between the postulates and total preorders can still be rescued if we can find another binary relation {a mathematical formula}≺′, different from ≺, that also induces ⁎ via Definition 2 and which is a total preorder. It turns out though that this is not the case.

        Let ⁎ be the function induced viaDefinition 2from the binary relation ≺ ofFig. 1. Every binary relation{a mathematical formula}⪯′that also induces ⁎ viaDefinition 2contains the cycle{a mathematical formula}pqr¯≺′p¯qr≺′pq¯r≺′pqr¯.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Proof">
        Let {a mathematical formula}⪯′ be a binary relation that induced ⁎ via Definition 2. From Fig. 1 it follows that {a mathematical formula}Cn(pqr¯)⁎p=Cn(pqr¯) and consequently, {a mathematical formula}pqr¯≺′pq¯r. Similarly, {a mathematical formula}Cn(pqr¯)⁎r=Cn(pq¯r) and therefore {a mathematical formula}pq¯r≺′p¯qr. Finally, from {a mathematical formula}Cn(pqr¯)⁎q=Cn(p¯qr) we derive {a mathematical formula}p¯qr≺′pqr¯. Hence we obtain the cycle {a mathematical formula}pqr¯≺′p¯qr≺′pq¯r≺′pqr¯.  □

      Horn revision: the approach
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      As is clear from the previous discussion, there are substantial differences between classical AGM revision and Horn revision. These differences come about from the weakened expressibility of Horn clause theories.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Consider again the issues discussed in the previous section. The first issue isn't a problem with Horn revision per se. Rather, it suggests that, when we look at Horn theories, belief change operators are not interdefinable, or at best are not readily interdefinable. The second issue also isn't a problem as such. Instead, it indicates that a ranking may be underconstrained by a revision function.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The third issue, that a ranking may violate the postulates (H*7) and (H*8), is indeed a problem. As discussed, the difficulty essentially is that some orderings are unsuitable with respect to Horn revision. The solution then is to add a constraint to faithful orderings such that these “unsuitable orderings” are ruled out. This is covered by the notion of Horn compliance, defined below.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      As the fourth problem demonstrates, the Horn AGM postulates may fail to rule out undesirable relations on sets of worlds, which is to say, the postulate set is too weak to eliminate certain undesirable non-preorders. This then requires adding an additional postulate, which we call (Acyc), to the postulate set (H*1)–(H*8) to (semantically) further constrain the set of allowable orderings.
     </paragraph>
     <section label="5.1">
      <section-title>
       Initial considerations
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In accordance with the previous discussion, on the one hand we add a condition to restrict rankings on worlds; on the other hand we add a postulate to the set of Horn AGM postulates.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       On the semantic side, we restrict rankings to those that yield coherent results with respect to Horn revision. That is, we want to allow only those orderings where revision by a Horn formula will yield a set of worlds corresponding to a Horn formula. Call a set of worlds W Horn elementary iff it is definable via a Horn formula, i.e. if there is a Horn formula ϕ such that {a mathematical formula}W=[ϕ]. So W is Horn elementary iff {a mathematical formula}W=Cl∩(W). A preorder {a mathematical formula}⪯H is Horn compliant iff for every formula {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈LH, {a mathematical formula}min⁡([ϕ],⪯H) is Horn elementary.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For example, the preorder in (5) is Horn compliant. Note that, while the set {a mathematical formula}{p¯q,pq¯} is not Horn elementary, there is no Horn formula ϕ over {a mathematical formula}P={p,q} such that {a mathematical formula}min⁡([ϕ],⪯H)={p¯q,pq¯}. On the other hand, the ordering in (6) is not Horn compliant since {a mathematical formula}min⁡([p∧q→⊥],⪯H)={p¯qr¯,pqr¯}, and {a mathematical formula}{p¯qr¯,pqr¯} is not Horn elementary.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       With respect to postulates, we want to rule out pseudo-preorders such as is shown in Fig. 1. This problem does not arise in standard AGM revision due to the expressivity of classical propositional logic. A (very) informal argument is as follows: Consider where we are given a function that satisfies the AGM postulates, and we wish to construct a corresponding faithful ordering. In a finite language (which is what is assumed in the Katsuno and Mendelzon approach) it is straightforward to determine the relative position of two possible worlds, {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2: Simply determine the result of revising by a formula with models given by {a mathematical formula}{w1,w2}. If the result corresponds to (the literals in) {a mathematical formula}w1 then one has {a mathematical formula}w1≺w2; if the result corresponds to {a mathematical formula}w2 then {a mathematical formula}w2≺w1; otherwise {a mathematical formula}w1≈w2. This breaks down in the Horn case because the formula corresponding to {a mathematical formula}{w1,w2} will in general not be Horn.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       However, it proves to be the case that we can still rule out pseudo-preorders such as given in Fig. 1. That is, our language is expressive enough to enforce the condition that, if there is a ⪯ cycle among possible worlds, then none of the ⪯ relations can be strict. Or, in other words, every ⪯ cycle is in fact an ≈ cycle. This then proves sufficient (after some more work) to construct a total preorder that captures a specific revision function. To this end, we introduce the following schema:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item>
        If for {a mathematical formula}0≤i&lt;n we have {a mathematical formula}(H⁎μi+1)+μi⊬⊥, and {a mathematical formula}(H⁎μ0)+μn⊬⊥, then {a mathematical formula}(H⁎μn)+μ0⊬⊥.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       Informally, (Acyc) rules out cycles (of any length n) as found for example in Fig. 1. To see this, consider the instance of (Acyc) for {a mathematical formula}n=2:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item>
        {a mathematical formula}If(H⁎μ1)+μ0⊬⊥and
       </list-item>
       <list-item>
        then
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       If revision is defined via Definition 2 and Eq. (2), then {a mathematical formula}(H⁎μ1)+μ0⊬⊥ iff {a mathematical formula}min⁡([μ1],⪯H)∩[μ0]≠∅. This last relation implies that, for {a mathematical formula}w1∈min⁡([μ1],⪯H) and {a mathematical formula}w0∈min⁡([μ0],⪯H) it must be that {a mathematical formula}w0⪯Hw1. Consequently, the postulate can then be read as requiring that if {a mathematical formula}w0⪯Hw1⪯Hw2⪯Hw0 then {a mathematical formula}w0⪯Hw2, and with some further deliberation, {a mathematical formula}w0≈Hw1≈Hw2 (thus ruling out the pseudo-preorder of Fig. 1).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We note that in the presence of the AGM postulates, (Acyc) is redundant for any underlying language/logic that contains classical propositional logic:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 3">
       If the underlying language/logic contains classical propositional logic, then (Acyc) is derivable from the AGM postulates (K*1)–(K*8).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       Assume that the underlying language {a mathematical formula}L and the entailment relationship ⊢ contain classical propositional logic. Let K be a theory of {a mathematical formula}L. We prove (Acyc) by induction on n.If {a mathematical formula}n=1, (Acyc) is trivially true.Assume that (Acyc) holds for all {a mathematical formula}n≤k.Consider now any sequence of sentences {a mathematical formula}μ0,μ1,…,μk,μk+1, such that:{a mathematical formula}From {a mathematical formula}(K⁎μ2)+μ1⊬⊥ we derive, via the AGM postulates, that {a mathematical formula}K⁎(μ1∨μ2)⊆K⁎μ1 (refer to properties (3.15) and (3.16) in [16]). Moreover, from {a mathematical formula}(K⁎μ1)+μ0⊬⊥ it follows that {a mathematical formula}¬μ0∉K⁎μ1. Consequently, {a mathematical formula}K⁎(μ1∨μ2)+μ0⊬⊥. Finally, from {a mathematical formula}(K⁎μ3)+μ2⊬⊥ we conclude that {a mathematical formula}(K⁎μ3)+(μ1∨μ2)⊬⊥. Hence,{a mathematical formula}From the induction hypothesis we then derive {a mathematical formula}(K⁎μk+1)+μ0⊬⊥ as desired.  □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       While, as Proposition 3 shows, (Acyc) follows from the AGM postulates in a classical setting, when we restrict the underlying language to Horn formulas, (Acyc) becomes independent from the corresponding postulates (H*1)–(H*8). Fig. 1 suffices to show this: Defining revision according to Definition 2 yields a revision function that satisfies (H*1)–(H*8) (see Proposition 1) and yet violates (Acyc) (simply consider the revisions by the Horn formulas {a mathematical formula}μ0=r, {a mathematical formula}μ1=q, and {a mathematical formula}μ2=p).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Corollary 1">
       If the underlying language/logic is Horn, then (Acyc) is independent of the (modified) AGM postulates (H*1)–(H*8).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Finally, we note that while (Acyc) does indeed rule out undesirable orderings such as that given in Fig. 1, nonetheless there are pseudo-orderings that satisfy (Acyc) along with the postulates (H*1)–(H*8). For example, consider Fig. 2.{sup:5}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       While this pseudo-preorder has the same structure as that in Fig. 1, notably, each world in the cycle contains two negated literals rather than one negated literals, as in Fig. 1. It can be readily verified that the revision function induced by the pseudo-preorder in Fig. 2 satisfies postulates (H*1)–(H*8) and (Acyc); we omit the details.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       This is not problematic for the approach, for the following reasons. In Fig. 1, the binary relation ≺ induces a revision function ⁎ such that every binary relation that induces ⁎ also contains the undesirable ≺-cycle. In Fig. 2, this is not the case. The pseudo-preorder shown in Fig. 2 induces a revision function {a mathematical formula}⁎′ satisfying (H*1)–(H*8) and (Acyc), but in this case there is a (non-pseudo) total preorder that also induces {a mathematical formula}⁎′ (simply erase any one of the three inequalities in the cycle). In fact, the “completeness” part of the representation result given in Theorem 3 shows how to construct such a satisfying preorder in the general case.

      <paragraph>
       The notion of Horn compliance on the one hand, and the postulate (Acyc) on the other, prove to be sufficient to extend the AGM approach to capture revision in Horn theories. We obtain the following results:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 2">

      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       The proof is much the same as for classical AGM revision. Postulates (H*1), (H*2), and (H*6) follow immediately from the definition of ⁎. For (H*3) and (H*4), if ϕ is inconsistent with H, then both postulates are trivially satisfied. If on the other hand ϕ is consistent with H, then from ⪯ being faithful, we derive that {a mathematical formula}min⁡([ϕ],⪯)=[H]∩[ϕ], and therefore (H*3) and (H*4) are satisfied.For (H*5), assume that ϕ is consistent. Then clearly, since ⪯ is a finite total preorder, {a mathematical formula}min⁡([ϕ],⪯)≠∅. Consequently, {a mathematical formula}⊥∉tH(min⁡([ϕ],⪯)) and therefore {a mathematical formula}⊥∉H⁎ϕ.For (H*7) and (H*8), if ϕ is inconsistent with {a mathematical formula}H⁎ψ, then both postulates are trivially satisfied. Assume therefore that ϕ is consistent with {a mathematical formula}H⁎ψ. This entails, since ⪯ is Horn compliant, that {a mathematical formula}[ϕ]∩min⁡([ψ],⪯)≠∅. Hence {a mathematical formula}min⁡([ϕ∧ψ],⪯)=[ϕ]∩min⁡([ψ],⪯)≠∅ and consequently, {a mathematical formula}H⁎(ϕ∧ψ)=(H⁎ψ)+ϕ. Thus (H*7) and (H*8) are satisfied.For (Acyc), let {a mathematical formula}μ0, {a mathematical formula}μ1, … , {a mathematical formula}μn, be a sequence of Horn formulas such that,{a mathematical formula}From {a mathematical formula}(H⁎μ1)+μ0⊬⊥ it follows that {a mathematical formula}[μ0]∩[tH(min⁡([μ1],⪯))]≠∅. Moreover, since ⪯ is Horn compliant, it follows that {a mathematical formula}[tH(min⁡([μ1],⪯))]=min⁡([μ1],⪯). Hence we derive that {a mathematical formula}[μ0]∩min⁡([μ1],⪯)≠∅, and therefore there is a {a mathematical formula}μ0-world, call it {a mathematical formula}w0′, such that {a mathematical formula}w0′⪯w1, for all {a mathematical formula}w1∈[μ1]. Similarly, from {a mathematical formula}(H⁎μ2)+μ1⊬⊥ we conclude that there is a {a mathematical formula}w1′∈[μ1] such that {a mathematical formula}w1′⪯w2, for all {a mathematical formula}w2∈[μ2],… , and from {a mathematical formula}(H⁎μn)+μn−1⊬⊥ we conclude that there is a {a mathematical formula}wn−1′∈[μn−1] such that {a mathematical formula}wn−1′⪯wn, for all {a mathematical formula}wn∈[μn]. Then, from transitivity we then derive that {a mathematical formula}w0′⪯wn, for all {a mathematical formula}wn∈[μn]. Finally, from {a mathematical formula}(H⁎μ0)+μn⊬⊥ it follows that there is a minimal {a mathematical formula}μ0-world, call it {a mathematical formula}w0″, that satisfies {a mathematical formula}μn. Moreover, from {a mathematical formula}w0″⪯w0′⪯wn (for all {a mathematical formula}wn∈[μn]), it follows that {a mathematical formula}w0″ is also a minimal {a mathematical formula}μn-world; i.e. {a mathematical formula}w0″∈min⁡([μn],⪯). Since {a mathematical formula}min⁡([μn],⪯) contains a {a mathematical formula}μ0-world, it follows that {a mathematical formula}μ0 is consistent with {a mathematical formula}H⁎μn as desired.  □

In general, {a mathematical formula}⪯′ is neither transitive nor total (although it is reflexive). The transitive closure of {a mathematical formula}⪯′, denoted {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎, is of course a preorder, but in general it is not total. We therefore construct an extension of {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎, denoted ⪯, which is total and moreover preserves the minimal μ-worlds (as defined with respect to {a mathematical formula}⪯′), for all Horn formulas μ.

Moreover, for any set of worlds V, {a mathematical formula}min⁡(V,⪯′) is defined as in Section 2; i.e. {a mathematical formula}min⁡(V,⪯′)={w∈V|for all w′∈V, if {a mathematical formula}w′⪯′w then {a mathematical formula}w⪯′w′}.

       {a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula}μ∈LH be any Horn formula and assume towards a contradiction that there is a {a mathematical formula}w1∈min⁡([μ],⪯′) such that {a mathematical formula}w1∉[H⁎μ]. From {a mathematical formula}w1∈min⁡([μ],⪯′) it follows that μ is consistent, and therefore, by (H*5), {a mathematical formula}[H⁎μ]≠∅. Let {a mathematical formula}w2 be any world in {a mathematical formula}[H⁎μ]. By Lemma 1, we then derive that {a mathematical formula}w1⪯̸′w2. This again entails that {a mathematical formula}w2⪯̸′w1 (for otherwise {a mathematical formula}w1 wouldn't be minimal in {a mathematical formula}[μ]). Let us denote by {a mathematical formula}w3 the intersection of {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2; i.e. {a mathematical formula}w3=w1∩w2.

Thus {a mathematical formula}[H⁎ϕ(w1,w3)]={w3} and consequently, {a mathematical formula}w3≺′w1.

Consequently, from {a mathematical formula}H⁎(ϕ(w1,wn)∧ϕ(w1,w2))=(H⁎ϕ(w1,wn))+ϕ(w1,w2) we conclude that {a mathematical formula}w1∈[H⁎ϕ(w1,wn)], and therefore {a mathematical formula}w1⪯′wn.  □

       Let us now define {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎ to be the transitive closure of {a mathematical formula}⪯′; i.e. {a mathematical formula}w⪯⁎w′ iff there exist worlds {a mathematical formula}u1,…,un, such that {a mathematical formula}w⪯′u1⪯′⋯⪯′un⪯′w′. By construction, {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎ is reflexive and transitive; i.e. {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎ is a partial preorder.

Then for every world {a mathematical formula}w∈S there is a {a mathematical formula}w′∈S such that {a mathematical formula}w≺⁎w′. Hence, we can start with any world {a mathematical formula}w0∈S, and build a sequence of worlds {a mathematical formula}w0,w1,w2,…∈S, such that, {a mathematical formula}w0≺⁎w1≺⁎w2≺⁎… . Given that there are only finitely many worlds, we will eventually reach a {a mathematical formula}wj that also appears earlier in the sequence; i.e. for some {a mathematical formula}i&lt;j, {a mathematical formula}wi=wj. Hence we get a cycle{a mathematical formula}wi≺⁎wi+1≺⁎⋯≺⁎wi+k≺⁎wi. From the definition of {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎ and Lemma 3 we then derive that {a mathematical formula}wi⪯′wi+k. Consequently, {a mathematical formula}wi⪯⁎wi+k. This of course contradicts {a mathematical formula}wi+k≺⁎wi.  □

       As mentioned in the beginning of the proof, the next step is to define an extension of {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎ which is total, and preserves the μ-minimal worlds, for all Horn formulas μ. To this end, consider the sequence of sets of worlds {a mathematical formula}S0,S1,… , defined recursively as follows:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Since there are finitely many worlds in {a mathematical formula}M, from Lemma 5 we derive that the sequence {a mathematical formula}S0, {a mathematical formula}S1, … will eventually reach the empty set, and will stay empty from then onwards. We shall denote by m the index of the last nonempty set in the sequence; i.e. {a mathematical formula}Sm≠∅ and {a mathematical formula}Sm+i=∅ for all {a mathematical formula}i≥1. It is not hard to see that the sets {a mathematical formula}S0,…,Sm form a partition of {a mathematical formula}M. Based on this partition {a mathematical formula}{Si}i∈[0,m], we finally define the binary relation {a mathematical formula}⪯⊆M×M as follows:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Lemma 6">
       Clearly, since {a mathematical formula}{Si}i∈[0,m] is a partition of {a mathematical formula}M, ⪯ is a total preorder. Also, it is not hard to verify that ⪯ is an extension of {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎. More importantly however, as shown by the following lemma, ⪯ preserves the μ-minimal worlds, for all Horn formulas μ: For all Horn formulas μ,{a mathematical formula}min⁡([μ],⪯)=min⁡([μ],⪯′).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       Let μ be any Horn formula. If {a mathematical formula}μ⊢⊥, then the lemma is trivially true. Assume therefore that μ is consistent. Let {a mathematical formula}Sk be the last set in the sequence {a mathematical formula}S0,…,Sm that intersects {a mathematical formula}[μ]. It is not hard to verify that {a mathematical formula}min⁡([μ],⪯)=Sk∩[μ]. Hence we need to show that {a mathematical formula}Sk∩[μ]=min⁡([μ],⪯′).{a mathematical formula} Assume that {a mathematical formula}w∈Sk∩[μ] and suppose towards a contradiction that {a mathematical formula}w∉min⁡([μ],⪯′). Then for some {a mathematical formula}w0∈[μ], {a mathematical formula}w0≺′w. Lemma 4 then entails that {a mathematical formula}w0≺⁎w. Then, {a mathematical formula}w0 is not maximal (with respect to {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎) in any set containing w, including of course {a mathematical formula}Sk. Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}Sk is the last set in the sequence {a mathematical formula}S0,…,Sm that intersects {a mathematical formula}[μ], it follows that {a mathematical formula}w0∈Sj for some {a mathematical formula}j&lt;k. Hence {a mathematical formula}w0 is maximal (with respect to {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎) in {a mathematical formula}M−⋃i=0j−1Si, and therefore, since {a mathematical formula}w0≺′w, we conclude that {a mathematical formula}w∉M−⋃i=0j−1Si. This however contradicts {a mathematical formula}w∈Sk and {a mathematical formula}k&gt;j.{a mathematical formula} Assume that {a mathematical formula}w0∈min⁡([μ],⪯′) and suppose towards a contradiction that {a mathematical formula}w0∉Sk∩[μ]. Then, clearly, {a mathematical formula}w0∈[μ] and {a mathematical formula}w0∉Sk. Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}Sk is the last set in the sequence {a mathematical formula}S0,…,Sm intersecting {a mathematical formula}[μ], it follows that {a mathematical formula}w0∈Sj for some {a mathematical formula}j&lt;k. Let {a mathematical formula}w1 be any world in {a mathematical formula}Sk∩[μ]. Since {a mathematical formula}j&lt;k we derive that {a mathematical formula}w1∈M−⋃i=0j−1Si, and since {a mathematical formula}w0 is maximal in {a mathematical formula}M−⋃i=0j−1Si, we have that {a mathematical formula}w0⊀⁎w1 and consequently, by Lemma 4, {a mathematical formula}w0⊀′w1. Next we show that {a mathematical formula}w0∈[H⁎ϕ(w0,w1)].Assume on the contrary that this is not the case. Then {a mathematical formula}w0⪯̸′w1, and since {a mathematical formula}w0 is minimal in {a mathematical formula}[μ], we derive that {a mathematical formula}w1⪯̸′w0, which in turn entails {a mathematical formula}w1∉[H⁎ϕ(w0,w1)]. That is, neither {a mathematical formula}w0 nor {a mathematical formula}w1 belong to {a mathematical formula}[H⁎ϕ(w0,w1)]. Let {a mathematical formula}w2 be the world such that {a mathematical formula}w2=w0∩w1. From {a mathematical formula}w0,w1∉[H⁎ϕ(w0,w1)], and given (H*2), (H*5), we derive that {a mathematical formula}[H⁎ϕ(w0,w1)]={w2}. Moreover it clearly follows that {a mathematical formula}w2⊂w0 and {a mathematical formula}w2⊂w1.From {a mathematical formula}[H⁎ϕ(w0,w1)]={w2} and postulates (H*7) and (H*8), we derive that {a mathematical formula}H⁎(ϕ(w0,w1)∧ϕ(w0,w2))=(H⁎ϕ(w0,w1))+ϕ(w0,w2)={w2}. Next observe that, since {a mathematical formula}w2=w0∩w1, it follows that {a mathematical formula}ϕ(w0,w2)⊢ϕ(w0,w1), and therefore, by (H*6), {a mathematical formula}H⁎(ϕ(w0,w1)∧ϕ(w1,w2))=H⁎ϕ(w0,w2). Consequently, {a mathematical formula}[H⁎ϕ(w0,w2)]={w2}, and therefore {a mathematical formula}w2≺′w0. Recall however that μ is Horn, and therefore from {a mathematical formula}w0,w1∈[μ], it follows that {a mathematical formula}w2∈[μ], and consequently, {a mathematical formula}w2≺′w0 contradicts the minimality of {a mathematical formula}w0 in {a mathematical formula}[μ]. Thus we have shown that {a mathematical formula}w0∈[H⁎ϕ(w0,w1)], and consequently, {a mathematical formula}w0⪯′w1.We are only one step away from reaching a contradiction and thus proving the lemma. This final step is to show that {a mathematical formula}w1 is maximal in {a mathematical formula}M−⋃i=0j−1Si. Indeed, consider any world {a mathematical formula}w3∈M−⋃i=0j−1Si, such that {a mathematical formula}w1⪯⁎w3. Then, {a mathematical formula}w0⪯′w1⪯⁎w3 implies {a mathematical formula}w0⪯⁎w3. Since {a mathematical formula}w0 is maximal in {a mathematical formula}M−⋃i=0j−1Si, we then derive that {a mathematical formula}w3⪯⁎w0. Hence from {a mathematical formula}w0⪯′w1 we conclude that {a mathematical formula}w3⪯⁎w1. Since {a mathematical formula}w3 was chosen arbitrarily, it follows that {a mathematical formula}w1 is maximal in {a mathematical formula}M−⋃i=0j−1Si.This however makes {a mathematical formula}w1 an element of {a mathematical formula}Sj, and since {a mathematical formula}j&lt;k, we derive a contradiction with {a mathematical formula}w1∈Sk.  □

       We can now put all the pieces together to complete the proof of the theorem. From Lemma 6 and Lemma 2 we have that the total preorder ⪯ is such that {a mathematical formula}[H⁎μ]=min⁡([μ],⪯), for all Horn formulas μ. This makes ⪯ Horn compliant. Finally, notice that ⪯ is also faithful with respect to H. Indeed, if H is inconsistent, this is trivially the case. Assume therefore that H is consistent, and let p be any propositional variable. By (H*3) and (H*4) we have that {a mathematical formula}H⁎(p→p)=H. Hence, {a mathematical formula}[H]=min⁡([p→p],⪯)=min⁡(M,⪯). Hence ⪯ is faithful with respect to H. □

      Iteration and Horn belief revision

     <paragraph>
      The results of the previous section prove that the classical AGM postulates can be recast in a Horn framework. In this section we show that this is also the case for the Darwiche and Pearl postulates for iterated revision [8].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      First a note on Horn compliance. It was shown in [31] that Horn compliance is equivalent to the following condition:

     <list>
      <list-item>
       If {a mathematical formula}w≈w′ then {a mathematical formula}(w∩w′)⪯w.

     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Condition ({a mathematical formula}H⪯) says that whenever two worlds w and {a mathematical formula}w′ are equidistant from the start of a preorder ⪯, then the world {a mathematical formula}w∩w′ resulting from their intersection cannot appear later in the preorder. Zhuang and Pagnucco show that any preorder that satisfies ({a mathematical formula}H⪯) is Horn compliant, and conversely, every Horn compliant preorder satisfies ({a mathematical formula}H⪯). Observe that ({a mathematical formula}H⪯) makes no reference to an input Horn formula μ. It is therefore a useful characterization of Horn compliance that will be used extensively in the rest of the article.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The postulates proposed by Darwiche and Pearl for iterated revision, call them the DP postulates, are shown below.{sup:7}

      We recall that the DP postulates have been characterized by corresponding restrictions on faithful rankings. In particular, let H be a belief set and ⪯ a faithful ranking with respect to H. Moreover, let us denote by {a mathematical formula}⪯μ the total preorder assigned to the belief set {a mathematical formula}H⁎μ resulting from the revision of H by μ. In [8] it was shown that the conditions (IR1)–(IR4) below characterize (DP1)–(DP4) respectively:

      <list-item label="(IR1)">
       If {a mathematical formula}w,w′∈[μ] then {a mathematical formula}w≺μw′ iff {a mathematical formula}w≺w′.

       If {a mathematical formula}w,w′∈[¬μ] then {a mathematical formula}w≺μw′ iff {a mathematical formula}w≺w′.

       If {a mathematical formula}w∈[μ] and {a mathematical formula}w′∈[¬μ] then {a mathematical formula}w≺w′ entails {a mathematical formula}w≺μw′.

       If {a mathematical formula}w∈[μ] and {a mathematical formula}w′∈[¬μ] then {a mathematical formula}w⪯w′ entails {a mathematical formula}w⪯μw′.

     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Thus to show that (DP1)–(DP4) are consistent with (H*1)–(H*8) and (Acyc), it suffices to prove the following result:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Theorem 4">
      Let H be a Horn belief set, and ⪯ a Horn compliant, faithful ranking with respect to H. Moreover, let ⁎ be the Horn revision function induced from ⪯ viaDefinition 2. For every Horn formula μ, there exists a Horn compliant, total preorder{a mathematical formula}⪯μ, that is faithful with respect to{a mathematical formula}H⁎μ, and such that (IR1)–(IR4) are satisfied.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Proof">
      Let μ be any Horn formula. Consider first the case where μ is inconsistent. Define {a mathematical formula}⪯μ to be equal to ⪯. Clearly, in this case {a mathematical formula}⪯μ satisfies (IR1)–(IR4). Moreover, since ⪯ is Horn compliant, so is {a mathematical formula}⪯μ. Finally for faithfulness, since μ is inconsistent, by (H*2), {a mathematical formula}[H⁎μ]=∅ and therefore {a mathematical formula}⪯μ is trivially faithful with respect to {a mathematical formula}H⁎μ. Hence the theorem is true when μ is inconsistent.Assume now that μ is consistent. We define {a mathematical formula}⪯μ as follows:{a mathematical formula} According to the above definition, to construct {a mathematical formula}⪯μ, one starts with ⪯ and simply places the minimal μ-worlds (with respect to ⪯) at the beginning of the ranking; everything else remains the same. We note that this construction is not new. It has been proposed by Boutilier [4], [5], in his treatment of iterated revision, and it is known to satisfy (IR1)–(IR4) [8]. Moreover, {a mathematical formula}⪯μ is clearly faithful with respect to {a mathematical formula}H⁎μ. Finally for Horn compliance, let {a mathematical formula}w,w′ be any two worlds such that {a mathematical formula}w≈μw′. Since ({a mathematical formula}H⪯) entails Horn compliance, it suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}(w∩w′)⪯μw.We distinguish between two cases. First assume that {a mathematical formula}w∈min⁡([μ],⪯). From {a mathematical formula}w≈μw′ we derive that {a mathematical formula}w′∈min⁡([μ],⪯). Since ⪯ is Horn compliant, this entails that {a mathematical formula}(w∩w′)∈min⁡([μ],⪯), and therefore, by the construction of {a mathematical formula}⪯μ, {a mathematical formula}(w∩w′)⪯μw as desired.Next assume that {a mathematical formula}w∉min⁡([μ],⪯). Then, by construction, {a mathematical formula}w′ also does not belong to {a mathematical formula}min⁡([μ],⪯). Therefore from {a mathematical formula}w≈μw′ we derive that {a mathematical formula}w≈w′. Since ⪯ is Horn compliant, by ({a mathematical formula}H⪯) it follows that {a mathematical formula}(w∩w′)⪯w. Consequently, since {a mathematical formula}w∉min⁡([μ],⪯), {a mathematical formula}(w∩w′)⪯μw.  □

      Relevance and Horn belief revision
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Apart from iteration, the notion of relevance was also not fully addressed by the AGM postulates. It was as tackled later with the addition of a new axiom due to Parikh [22]. In this section we shall examine the compatibility of Horn revision with Parikh's axiom for relevance.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In [22], Parikh argues that the following intuitive rule should be adhered to during the revision of a theory H by a sentence ϕ: the beliefs in H that are not relevant to ϕ should not be affected. To formally encode this rule, Parikh proposed a new axiom, which in [23] was shown to be equivalent to the following condition:{sup:8}
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="(R1)">
       If {a mathematical formula}H=Cn(χ,ψ), {a mathematical formula}Pχ∩Pψ=∅, and {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lχ, then {a mathematical formula}(H⁎ϕ)∩Lχ¯=H∩Lχ¯.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Some explanations are due. For a sentence γ, by {a mathematical formula}Pγ we denote the minimum set of propositional variables in which γ can be expressed, and by {a mathematical formula}Lγ we denote the propositional language built over {a mathematical formula}Pγ∪{⊥}.{sup:9} Moreover, by {a mathematical formula}Lγ¯ we denote the propositional language built over {a mathematical formula}(P−Pγ)∪{⊥}.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Condition (R1) essentially encodes the intuitive rule discussed earlier for the special case of a “composite” belief set H: if H can be split into two disjoint parts χ, ψ, and the new information ϕ belongs entirely to the minimum language of the first part χ, then the second part is not affected by the revision of H by ϕ.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Condition (R1) was characterised semantically in [23] in terms of two constraints on faithful assignments named (Q1) and (Q2). We shall use this characterisation to prove the consistency between (R1) and (H1)–(H8), (Acyc). First however we need some additional notation related to the difference between a theory and a possible world.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Let H be a theory and let {a mathematical formula}Q={Q1,…,Qn} be a partition of the set P of propositional variables; i.e. {a mathematical formula}⋃Q=P, {a mathematical formula}Qi≠∅, and {a mathematical formula}Qi∩Qj=∅, for all {a mathematical formula}1≤i≠j≤n. We say that {a mathematical formula}Q={Q1,…,Qn} is an H-splitting iff there exist sentences {a mathematical formula}ϕ1∈LQ1,…,ϕn∈LQn, such that {a mathematical formula}H=Cn(ϕ1,…,ϕn).{sup:10} Parikh has shown in [22] that for every theory H there is a unique finest H-splitting, i.e. one which refines every other H-splitting.{sup:11}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Consider now a world w and a theory H whose finest H-splitting is F. The difference, {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w), between H and w is defined as follows [23]:{a mathematical formula}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Observe that whenever H is not a complete theory, there can be two (or more) distinct worlds with the same difference from H. Consider for example the Horn theory {a mathematical formula}H=Cn({p↔q,r↔u}), whose finest splitting is, clearly, the set {a mathematical formula}F={{p,q},{r,u}}. Then the worlds {a mathematical formula}w1=pq¯ru and {a mathematical formula}w2=p¯qru have the same difference from H; namely, {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)=Diff(H,w2)={p,q}.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Notice that {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2 have also another thing in common: they agree in all variables outside their difference from H. On the other hand, the worlds {a mathematical formula}w3=pqr¯u and {a mathematical formula}w4=pqr¯u, which also have the same difference from H, namely {a mathematical formula}{r,u}, disagree on the variables outside {a mathematical formula}{r,u}. Yet {a mathematical formula}w3 and {a mathematical formula}w4 agree on the variables inside their (common) difference from H. We call the first pair of worlds {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2external H-duals, and the second pair {a mathematical formula}w3, {a mathematical formula}w4, internal H-duals.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      More precisely, given a theory H, two worlds {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2 are called external H-duals iff {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)=Diff(H,w2) and for all {a mathematical formula}x∈P−Diff(H,w1), {a mathematical formula}w1⊨x iff {a mathematical formula}w2⊨x. Moreover, two worlds {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2 are called internal H-duals iff {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)=Diff(H,w2) and for all {a mathematical formula}x∈Diff(H,w1), {a mathematical formula}w1⊨x iff {a mathematical formula}w2⊨x. See [23] for a discussion on internal and external duals.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The final notion that we need to recall from [23] is that of a cover. Given a theory H and any three worlds {a mathematical formula}w1,w2,w3, we say that {a mathematical formula}w3 is a {a mathematical formula}w2-cover of {a mathematical formula}w1 iff {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)⊂Diff(H,w2), {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w3 are external H-duals, and moreover, for all {a mathematical formula}x∈Diff(H,w1), {a mathematical formula}w3⊨x iff {a mathematical formula}w2⊨x.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      To give an example of a cover, consider again the theory {a mathematical formula}H=Cn({p↔q,r↔u}), and let {a mathematical formula}w1,w2,w3 be the worlds {a mathematical formula}w1=pq¯ru, {a mathematical formula}w2=p¯qru¯, and {a mathematical formula}w3=p¯qru. Clearly {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w3 are external H-duals. Moreover, {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)={p,q}, {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w2)={p,q,r,u}, and therefore {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)⊂Diff(H,w2). Finally notice that {a mathematical formula}w3 agrees with {a mathematical formula}w2 on the values of {a mathematical formula}p,q. Hence {a mathematical formula}w3 is a {a mathematical formula}w2-cover of {a mathematical formula}w1. Refer to [23] for a discussion on the notion of a cover.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      It was shown in [23] that for a theory H and a total preorder ⪯ that is faithful with respect to H, the revision function ⁎ induced from ⪯ satisfies (R1) iff ⪯ satisfies the following two conditions:{sup:12}
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="(Q1)">
       If {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)⊂Diff(H,w2) then there is a world {a mathematical formula}w3 that is a {a mathematical formula}w2-cover of {a mathematical formula}w1, such that {a mathematical formula}w3≺w2.
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="(Q2)">
       If {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2 are internal H-duals, then {a mathematical formula}w1≈w2.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      With the aid of this characterisation of (R1), Theorem 5 below shows that Parikh's axiom for relevance is consistent with Horn revision:

     <paragraph label="Theorem 5">

       {a mathematical formula}|Δ(H,w1)|&lt;|Δ(H,w2)|, or{a mathematical formula}|Δ(H,w1)|=|Δ(H,w2)|, and for some {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤k, {a mathematical formula}{F1,…,Fi−1}⊆Δ(H,w1)∩Δ(H,w2), {a mathematical formula}Fi∈Δ(H,w1), and {a mathematical formula}Fi∉Δ(H,w2), or{a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)=Diff(H,w2), and for some {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤n, {a mathematical formula}{p1,…,pi−1}⊆w1∩w2∩Diff(H,w1), {a mathematical formula}pi∈Diff(H,w1), {a mathematical formula}pi∈w1, and {a mathematical formula}pi∉w2.Intuitively the above definition works in three steps as follows: first worlds are ordered according to the cardinality of their disparity from
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       A few words about the above sequence before we proceed with the definition of ⪯.Clearly by construction, the sets in the above sequence are pairwise disjoint. Moreover, since ≪ is acyclic, it follows that for any nonempty set of worlds Q, the set {a mathematical formula}{w∈Q: for all {a mathematical formula}w′∈Q, {a mathematical formula}w′≪̸w} is also nonempty. This again entails that there is an {a mathematical formula}m∈ℵ such that for all {a mathematical formula}0≤i≤m, {a mathematical formula}Si≠∅ and {a mathematical formula}⋃j=0mSj=M. In other words, {a mathematical formula}{S0,…,Sm} is a partition of {a mathematical formula}M; we shall call the elements of this partition cells.Next we show that {a mathematical formula}S0=[H]. Since H is assumed to be consistent, then {a mathematical formula}[H]≠∅. Let {a mathematical formula}w1 by any world in {a mathematical formula}[H]. Clearly {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)=∅ and therefore by the definition of ≪ there is no world {a mathematical formula}w2 such that {a mathematical formula}w2≪w1; hence {a mathematical formula}[H]⊆S0. For the converse let {a mathematical formula}w2 be any world in {a mathematical formula}M−[H]. Then {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w2)≠∅ and therefore {a mathematical formula}∅=|Δ(H,w1)|&lt;|Δ(H,w2)| for any {a mathematical formula}w1∈[H]. This again entails {a mathematical formula}w1≪w2 and consequently {a mathematical formula}w2∉S0. Hence {a mathematical formula}S0⊆[H] as desired.We can now define the preorder ⪯ alluded in the beginning of the proof as follows:{a mathematical formula}Since {a mathematical formula}{S0,…,Sm} is a partition of {a mathematical formula}M, then by construction ⪯ is a total preorder in {a mathematical formula}M. Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}S0=[H], it follows that ⪯ is faithful wrt H. Hence to conclude the proof of the theorem we need to show that ⪯ satisfies (Q1), (Q2), and ({a mathematical formula}H⪯).For (Q1), consider any two worlds {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2 such that {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)⊂Diff(H,w2). Then clearly, {a mathematical formula}|Δ(H,w1)|&lt;|Δ(H,w2)|. Define {a mathematical formula}w3 to be the world that agrees with {a mathematical formula}w2 in all variables in {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1), and it agrees with {a mathematical formula}w1 outside {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1); i.e. {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)∩w3=Diff(H,w1)∩w2 and {a mathematical formula}(P−Diff(H,w1))∩w3=(P−Diff(H,w1))∩w1. Clearly {a mathematical formula}w3 is a {a mathematical formula}w2-cover of {a mathematical formula}w1. Moreover by construction, {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w3)=Diff(H,w1), and therefore {a mathematical formula}|Δ(H,w3)|&lt;|Δ(H,w2)|. Consequently {a mathematical formula}w3≪w2. Let {a mathematical formula}Si and {a mathematical formula}Sj be the cells that the two worlds {a mathematical formula}w3 and {a mathematical formula}w2 respectively belong. Since {a mathematical formula}w3≪w2 it follows that {a mathematical formula}i&lt;j. Hence {a mathematical formula}w3≺w2 as desired.For (Q2), let {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2 be two internal H-duals. It suffices to show that both worlds belong to the same cell. Assume towards contradiction that {a mathematical formula}w1∈Si, {a mathematical formula}w2∈Sj and {a mathematical formula}i≠j. Moreover, without loss of generality, assume that {a mathematical formula}i&lt;j. Then {a mathematical formula}w1,w2∈(P−⋃k=0i−1Sk). Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}w2∉Si it follows that there is a {a mathematical formula}w3∈(P−⋃k=0i−1Sk) such that {a mathematical formula}w3≪w2. Notice however that since {a mathematical formula}w2 and {a mathematical formula}w1 are internal H-duals, from the definition of ≪ it follows that {a mathematical formula}w3≪w1. This however contradicts our assumption that {a mathematical formula}w1∈Si. Hence {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2 belong to the same cell and therefore (Q2) is satisfied.Finally for ({a mathematical formula}H⪯), consider any two worlds {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2 such that {a mathematical formula}w1≈w2. Then clearly, by the construction of ⪯, {a mathematical formula}w1≪̸w2 and {a mathematical formula}w2≪̸w1. From the definition of ≪ this entails that {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2 are internal H-duals, or equivalently, {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)=Diff(H,w2) and {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)∩Diff(w1,w2)=∅.Define {a mathematical formula}w=w1∩w2. Clearly, {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)⊆Diff(H,w), and {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)∩Diff(w1,w)=∅. Next we show that it is also the case that {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w)⊆Diff(H,w1).Since {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2 agree with H outside {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1), it follows that there exist worlds {a mathematical formula}w1′,w2′∈[H] such that, {a mathematical formula}w1′ agrees with {a mathematical formula}w1 outside {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1), and {a mathematical formula}w2′ agrees with {a mathematical formula}w2 outside {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1); i.e. {a mathematical formula}w1′∩(P−Diff(H,w1))=w1∩(P−Diff(H,w1)), and {a mathematical formula}w2′∩(P−Diff(H,w1))=w2∩(P−Diff(H,w1)). Consequently, {a mathematical formula}(w1′∩w2′)∩(P−Diff(H,w1))=(w1∩w2)∩(P−Diff(H,w1))=w∩(P−Diff(H,w1)). Moreover observe that, since H is Horn, its models are closed under intersection, and therefore {a mathematical formula}w1′∩w2′∈[H]. Hence we have shown that there is an H-world, namely {a mathematical formula}w1′∩w2′, that agrees with w on all variables outside {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1). Clearly then {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w)⊆Diff(H,w1).Combining the above we have that {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)=Diff(H,w), and moreover {a mathematical formula}Diff(H,w1)∩Diff(w1,w)=∅. By the construction of ⪯ we then derive that {a mathematical formula}w1≈w.  □

      We conclude this section with a note on relevance and iterated revision. It was shown in [24] that the DP postulates contradict Parikh's axiom for relevance. It may therefore be surprising at first that Horn revision is consistent with both. On reflection thought the reader will realise that the results herein guarantee only that Horn revision is consistent with each of the two, not with their conjunction.

      Specific Horn revision operators
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      One of the main reasons for studying belief revision in a Horn setting is because of the attractive computational properties of Horn logic: Horn satisfiability is decidable in linear time[13]. In this section, we take advantage of this feature of Horn logic, and develop two specific Horn revision operators, called basic and canonical revision, which also have polynomial time complexity; in particular, {a mathematical formula}O(n) and {a mathematical formula}O(n2log⁡n) respectively.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      First however, let us examine two of the most popular revision operators in the classical AGM setting, namely the ones introduced by Dalal [7] and Satoh [27]. It turns out that neither of these two operators can be applied directly in a Horn setting; nevertheless, they provide a guiding intuition for developing our own Horn revision functions.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Recall that Dalal and Satoh both define belief revision in terms of specific preorders on possible worlds, which we denote {a mathematical formula}⪯D and {a mathematical formula}⪯S respectively. In particular, for any two worlds w and {a mathematical formula}w′ the difference between w and {a mathematical formula}w′, denoted {a mathematical formula}Diff(w,w′), is defined as the set of propositional variables that have different truth values in the two worlds; in symbols,{a mathematical formula}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Given a theory H, Dalal defines the faithful ranking associated with H as follows:{a mathematical formula} In the above definition, {a mathematical formula}|S| denotes the cardinality of a set S. Satoh's definition is very similar to Dalal's, except that instead of cardinality, Satoh uses set inclusion:{a mathematical formula}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Proposition 4">
      There exist Horn theories H for which neither Dalal's preorder{a mathematical formula}⪯Dnor Satoh's preorder{a mathematical formula}⪯Sare Horn compliant.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Proof">
      Assume that the underlying propositional language is that built from the propositional variables p, q. Define H to be the Horn theory {a mathematical formula}H=CnH({p,q}). Then both Dalal and Satoh, assign the following preorder ⪯ to H: {a mathematical formula}pq≺pq¯≈p¯q≺pq¯. Notice however that the worlds {a mathematical formula}pq¯ and {a mathematical formula}p¯q violate condition ({a mathematical formula}H⪯), and therefore ⪯ is not Horn compliant.  □
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In the classical AGM framework, Dalal's and Satoh's operators can be viewed as “off-the-shelf” domain independent revision functions that can be used when no information is available about the relative plausibility of possible worlds. In particular, in the absence of any other information, both Dalal and Satoh assume that the plausibility of a possible world w, is defined in terms of the truth values of the atoms in w, and their relation with the corresponding values at the initial belief set. Although, as shown above, Dalal's and Satoh's operators cannot be applied directly in a Horn setting, their intuition of an atom-based plausibility is used below to develop our own operators for Horn revision.

       Basic Horn revision
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Like Dalal and Satoh, we define basic Horn revision in terms of preorders on possible worlds (one per Horn belief set). In particular, let H be a belief set. We define the basic Horn ranking associated with H, denoted ⪯, as follows:{a mathematical formula} This ordering reflects an intuition deriving from the logic programming community, that an atom is false unless it is (depending on the underlying approach) “required” to be true. Here we give preference to worlds with fewer true atomic propositions. We will show that ⪯ is a total preorder, faithful with respect to H, and also Horn compliant. First however, let us familiarize ourselves with the definition of ⪯ by considering a specific example.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Suppose that the underlying language {a mathematical formula}LH is built from the propositional variables {a mathematical formula}p,q,r and that the initial belief set is {a mathematical formula}H=Cn(p¯∧(q∨r¯)). The worlds in {a mathematical formula}[H], namely, {a mathematical formula}p¯qr, {a mathematical formula}p¯qr¯, and {a mathematical formula}pq¯r¯, will be placed in the beginning of the preorder ⪯; the rest will be ranked according to the number of atoms satisfied by each world:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 6">
       Let H be a Horn belief set, and let ⪯ be the basic Horn ranking associated with H. Then ⪯ is a total preorder, faithful with respect to H, and Horn compliant.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       By definition, ⪯ is clearly reflexive. For transitivity, let {a mathematical formula}w0, {a mathematical formula}w1, and {a mathematical formula}w2 be any three worlds such that {a mathematical formula}w0⪯w1 and {a mathematical formula}w1⪯w2. If {a mathematical formula}w0∈[H], then clearly {a mathematical formula}w0⪯w2. Assume therefore that {a mathematical formula}w0∉[H]. Then {a mathematical formula}w0⪯w1 entails {a mathematical formula}w1∉[H], and {a mathematical formula}|w0|≤|w1|. Similarly, from {a mathematical formula}w1∉[H] and {a mathematical formula}w1⪯w2, we derive that {a mathematical formula}w2∉[H], and {a mathematical formula}|w1|≤|w2|. Hence {a mathematical formula}|w0|≤|w2| and {a mathematical formula}w0,w2∉[H]. Consequently {a mathematical formula}w0⪯w2 as desired.For totality, let {a mathematical formula}w0 and {a mathematical formula}w1 be any two worlds. If either of them is in {a mathematical formula}[H], then clearly the two worlds are comparable with respect to ⪯. Assume therefore that neither of them are members of {a mathematical formula}[H]. If {a mathematical formula}|w0|≤|w1| then {a mathematical formula}w0⪯w1; otherwise {a mathematical formula}w1⪯w0. In either case the two worlds are comparable with respect to ⪯ and hence ⪯ is total.Faithfulness with respect to H follows immediately from the definition of ⪯. Hence to complete the proof we need to show that ⪯ is Horn compliant. We do so by proving that ({a mathematical formula}H⪯) is satisfied. Consider therefore any two worlds {a mathematical formula}w,w′ such that {a mathematical formula}w≈w′. We will show that {a mathematical formula}(w∩w′)⪯w. If {a mathematical formula}w∩w′∈[H] this is clearly true. Assume therefore that {a mathematical formula}w∩w′∉[H]. Then, since H is Horn, not both w and {a mathematical formula}w′ can be members of {a mathematical formula}[H]. Since one of {a mathematical formula}w,w′ is not in {a mathematical formula}[H], from {a mathematical formula}w≈w′ we derive that neither of the two worlds belong to {a mathematical formula}[H]. Moreover, clearly, {a mathematical formula}|w∩w′|≤|w|. Therefore, {a mathematical formula}(w∩w′)⪯w as desired.  □

      <paragraph>
       We define the basic Horn revision function ∘ to be the function induced from the basic Horn ranking(s) ⪯ via Definition 2. Clearly, in view of Theorem 6, ∘ satisfies (H*1)–(H*8), (Acyc). Moreover, as we will show later in this section, ∘ has nice computational properties. It therefore seems that ∘ is the ideal “off-the-shelf” Horn revision operator: it is simple to understand, easy to compute (see below), and has all the right theoretical properties. There is however one feature of ∘ that may be undesirable in some cases: whenever the new information μ is inconsistent with the initial belief set H, the new belief set {a mathematical formula}H∘μ is complete. This behaviour is a consequence of the following result:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 5">
       Let μ be a consistent Horn formula, and let{a mathematical formula}wμbe the world{a mathematical formula}wμ={pi∈P|μ⊢pi}. Then{a mathematical formula}wμ∈[μ], and moreover, every world in{a mathematical formula}[μ]is a superset of{a mathematical formula}wμ.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       We show that {a mathematical formula}wμ∈[μ] by showing that {a mathematical formula}wμ satisfies every clause of μ. Let {a mathematical formula}cj be an arbitrary clause of μ, where a clause is represented as a set of literals. If {a mathematical formula}wμ∩cj≠∅ or if {a mathematical formula}cj is a singleton, then clearly {a mathematical formula}wμ⊨cj.{sup:13} Assume therefore that {a mathematical formula}cj is not a singleton and moreover {a mathematical formula}wμ∩cj=∅. We distinguish between two cases depending on whether {a mathematical formula}cj is a positive or negative Horn clause.{sup:14} Assume first that {a mathematical formula}cj is a positive Horn clause. Then for some atoms {a mathematical formula}pj, {a mathematical formula}pk1,…,pkm∈P, {a mathematical formula}cj={pj,¬pk1,…,¬pkm}. Notice that if all of the atoms {a mathematical formula}pk1,…,pkm belong to {a mathematical formula}wμ, then {a mathematical formula}μ⊢pj, and consequently, {a mathematical formula}pj∈wμ. This however contradicts our assumption {a mathematical formula}wμ∩cj=∅. Hence, at least one of the atoms {a mathematical formula}pk1,…,pkm, say the atom {a mathematical formula}pkr, does not belong to {a mathematical formula}wμ. Consequently, {a mathematical formula}wμ⊨¬pkr, and therefore {a mathematical formula}wμ⊨cj.Next assume that {a mathematical formula}cj is a negative Horn clause; i.e., for some atoms {a mathematical formula}pk1,…,pkm∈P, {a mathematical formula}cj={¬pk1,…,¬pkm}. Since μ is consistent, not all of the atoms {a mathematical formula}pk1,…,pkm belong to {a mathematical formula}wμ. Therefore one of these atoms, call it {a mathematical formula}pkr, is such that {a mathematical formula}wμ⊨¬pkr. Consequently, once again, {a mathematical formula}wμ⊨cj. Since {a mathematical formula}cj was chosen as an arbitrary clause of μ, we derive that {a mathematical formula}wμ⊨μ as desired.Finally, for the second part of the result, let {a mathematical formula}w′ be any world in {a mathematical formula}[μ]. We will show that {a mathematical formula}wμ⊆w′. Let {a mathematical formula}pi be any atom in {a mathematical formula}wμ. By construction, {a mathematical formula}μ⊢pi. Hence, since {a mathematical formula}w′⊨μ it follows that {a mathematical formula}w′⊨pi, or equivalently, {a mathematical formula}pi∈w′. Consequently, {a mathematical formula}wμ⊆w′ as desired.  □

      <paragraph>
       An immediate consequence of the above result is that, for any consistent Horn formula μ, there is only one smallest μ-world (in terms of cardinality); namely the world {a mathematical formula}wμ as defined in Proposition 5. Consequently, given the definition of the basic ranking ⪯ associated with a Horn belief set H, if {a mathematical formula}H+μ⊢⊥, then {a mathematical formula}min⁡([μ],⪯) is a singleton. Clearly too, this will be the same as the minimal μ-model. Therefore,

       Let H be a Horn belief set and μ be a Horn formula. If{a mathematical formula}H+μ⊢⊥, then

       As mentioned earlier, these features of basic Horn revision could be undesirable in many situations. In fact, this is the main reason for introducing an alternative Horn revision operator in the next section. Nevertheless, in situations where completeness can be tolerated, basic Horn revision can be computed in polynomial, in fact linear time. Let {a mathematical formula}ϕ,μ be Horn formulas and let n be the size of both these formulas. Moreover, assume that {a mathematical formula}P={p1,…,pm} are the atoms that appear in {a mathematical formula}ϕ,μ. Below is an algorithm for computing {a mathematical formula}Cn(ϕ)∘μ in time {a mathematical formula}O(n).

       Algorithm A1 first deals with the limiting cases. In particular, it checks if the epistemic input μ is inconsistent, or consistent with the initial belief set {a mathematical formula}Cn(ϕ), in which case it returns respectively, μ and {a mathematical formula}ϕ∧μ. If on the other hand μ is consistent and {a mathematical formula}ϕ∧μ⊢⊥, then A1 computes the minimal μ-model, denoted {a mathematical formula}wμ, and returns {a mathematical formula}wμ as the result. In view of Proposition 5, this is indeed correct.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In terms of computational complexity, in [13] it has been shown that Horn satisfiability, as well as the computation of {a mathematical formula}wμ (if μ is satisfiable), can be accomplished in linear time. Hence the overall time complexity of A1 is also linear.

       Canonical Horn revision
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       As discussed above, the “maximalist” behaviour of basic Horn revision (as stated in Corollary 2), may not be a desirable feature in some cases. Therefore in this section we introduce a second Horn revision operator, denoted ⋆, which we call canonical Horn revision. Contrary to basic Horn revision, which is defined semantically, canonical Horn revision is defined syntactically. In particular, starting with a set of Horn clauses {a mathematical formula}H0 representing the initial belief set, we shall define a sequence of progressively weaker sets {a mathematical formula}H1, {a mathematical formula}H2, … , called fallbacks, through which {a mathematical formula}H⋆μ is defined for any Horn formula μ.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To be precise, canonical Horn revision is not a single revision function, but rather a whole family of functions parameterized by a total preorder on atoms. In particular, let ≦ be a total preorder on the set {a mathematical formula}P of atoms. We define the subsets {a mathematical formula}P1,P2,… of {a mathematical formula}P recursively as follows:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Clearly, since {a mathematical formula}P is finite, at some point the above sequence will reach the empty set and will remain equal to the empty set from then onwards. Let us denote by z the index of the last nonempty set in the above sequence. By construction, {a mathematical formula}P1, {a mathematical formula}P2, … , {a mathematical formula}Pz is a partition of {a mathematical formula}P. Based on this partition, we define the fallback sets {a mathematical formula}H1,…,Hz (relative to ≦) as follows:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Some explanations are due. Firstly, for a set of atoms {a mathematical formula}Pi, by {a mathematical formula}Pi¯ we denote the set of negated atoms of {a mathematical formula}Pi; i.e. {a mathematical formula}Pi¯={¬p|p∈Pi}. Secondly, all {a mathematical formula}Hi in the above sequence are sets of clauses, which in turn are represented as sets of literals. Hence each {a mathematical formula}Hi is constructed from {a mathematical formula}H0 by adding the negated atoms of the partitions {a mathematical formula}P0,…,Pi, to all clauses of {a mathematical formula}H0. Notice that only negated atoms are added to the clauses of {a mathematical formula}Hi, and consequently, since {a mathematical formula}H0 is Horn, so is {a mathematical formula}Hi. It should be clear from the construction that {a mathematical formula}Hi⊢Hj for all {a mathematical formula}0≤i≤j≤z. Finally notice that it is possible during the above construction that a clause degenerate to a tautology; such clauses can be safely removed from the fallback sets.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       An example will help us clarify the above observations. Assume that the language {a mathematical formula}LH is built from five atoms, i.e. {a mathematical formula}P={p,q,r,u,v}. Let the initial belief base {a mathematical formula}H0 be {a mathematical formula}H0={{p,q¯},{q¯,r¯}} and let the preorder ≦ on atoms be {a mathematical formula}u,v≦p≦q,r. Then the sets {a mathematical formula}Pi, {a mathematical formula}Hi are defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The notion of a fallback used for the sets {a mathematical formula}Hi is not new in the belief revision literature (see [21]). Loosely speaking, the intuition is that, besides the initial belief base {a mathematical formula}H0, there exists a sequence of progressively weaker belief bases {a mathematical formula}H1,…,Hz, to which the agent can fall back to if the new information μ contradicts {a mathematical formula}H0. Herein the fallback sets are induced by a preorder ≦ on atoms which can be understood as representing their a priori comparative plausibility: the earlier an atom p appears in the preorder, the more plausible its negation is.{sup:16}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The way fallback sets are used to define canonical Horn revision is quite simple. In particular, for any Horn sentence μ, let us denote by {a mathematical formula}Hμ the first set in the sequence {a mathematical formula}H0,H1,…,Hz that is consistent with μ; if all sets in the sequence are inconsistent with μ, we define {a mathematical formula}Hμ to be the empty set. The canonical Horn revision of {a mathematical formula}Cn(H0) by μ (parameterized by ≦) is defined as follows:{sup:17}{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The first thing we note about canonical Horn revision is that it doesn't have the maximalist attitude of basic Horn revision. Continuing with our previous example, suppose that we revise the initial belief base {a mathematical formula}H0={{p,q¯},{q¯,r¯}} with {a mathematical formula}μ={{p¯},{q}}. Then, {a mathematical formula}Hμ=H1, and therefore the revised belief base is {a mathematical formula}{{p,q¯,u¯,v¯},{q¯,r¯,u¯,v¯},{p¯},{q}}, which clearly is not complete. The next result shows that canonical Horn revision also has all the essential theoretical properties.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 7">
       Let ≦ be a total preorder on the set of propositional variables{a mathematical formula}P. The canonical Horn revision function ⋆, parameterized by ≦, satisfies (H*1)–(H*8), and (Acyc).

      <paragraph label="Proof">
       Let {a mathematical formula}H0 be a set of Horn clauses representing the initial belief set {a mathematical formula}H=Cn(H0), and let {a mathematical formula}H1,…,Hz, be the fallback sets induced from ≦ and {a mathematical formula}H0. We shall construct a total preorder on worlds ⪯, which we will show to be faithful with respect to H, Horn compliant, and such that {a mathematical formula}min⁡([μ],⪯)=[(Hμ∪μ)]. In view of Theorem 3, the existence of such a preorder ⪯ suffices to prove Theorem 7. We define the preorder ⪯ in {a mathematical formula}M as follows:{a mathematical formula}Reflexivity and transitivity of ⪯ follow immediately from the definition. Hence ⪯ is indeed a preorder. For totality, consider any two worlds {a mathematical formula}w,w′, such that {a mathematical formula}w′⪯̸w. We show that {a mathematical formula}w⪯w′. Consider any fallback set {a mathematical formula}Hj such that {a mathematical formula}w′∈Hj. From {a mathematical formula}w′⪯̸w we derive that there is a fallback set {a mathematical formula}Hi such that {a mathematical formula}w∈[Hi] and {a mathematical formula}w′∉[Hi]. Moreover, by construction, the fallback sets become progressively weaker, and therefore, for any {a mathematical formula}k,m, {a mathematical formula}[Hk]⊆[Hm] iff {a mathematical formula}k≤m. Hence, from {a mathematical formula}w′∉[Hi] and {a mathematical formula}w′∈[Hj] we derive that {a mathematical formula}i≤j. This again, together with {a mathematical formula}w∈[Hi], entails that {a mathematical formula}w∈[Hj]. Thus {a mathematical formula}w⪯w′, and ⪯ is total.For faithfulness, if H is inconsistent, then ⪯ is trivially faithful with respect to H. Assume therefore that H is consistent and let w be any world in {a mathematical formula}[H]. Then, by construction, {a mathematical formula}w∈[Hi], for all {a mathematical formula}0≤i≤n. Hence {a mathematical formula}w⪯w′ for all {a mathematical formula}w′∈M, and therefore {a mathematical formula}[H]⊆min⁡(M,⪯). For the converse, let w be any world in {a mathematical formula}min⁡(M,⪯), and let {a mathematical formula}w′ be a world in {a mathematical formula}[H]. Since w is minimal, it follows that {a mathematical formula}w⪯w′. Hence, by the definition of ⪯ and since {a mathematical formula}w′∈[H], we derive that {a mathematical formula}w∈[H].For Horn compliance, we will once again use its equivalent condition ({a mathematical formula}H⪯). Consider any two worlds {a mathematical formula}w,w′ such that {a mathematical formula}w≈w′, and let {a mathematical formula}w″ be the world resulting from their intersection; i.e. {a mathematical formula}w″=w∩w′. Consider now any fallback set {a mathematical formula}Hi such that {a mathematical formula}w∈[Hi]. Then from {a mathematical formula}w≈w′, it follows that {a mathematical formula}w′∈[Hi], and consequently, since by construction {a mathematical formula}Hi is Horn, we derive that {a mathematical formula}w″∈[Hi]. Thus {a mathematical formula}w″⪯w as desired.Finally we show that for every Horn formula μ, {a mathematical formula}min⁡([μ],⪯)=[(Hμ∪μ)]. If μ is inconsistent, then this is clearly true. Assume therefore that μ is consistent. If {a mathematical formula}Hμ=∅ then no fallback set is consistent with μ, and consequently, by the definition of ⪯, all μ-worlds are equally ranked with respect to ⪯, which again entails that {a mathematical formula}min⁡([μ],⪯)=[μ]=[Hμ∩μ]. Assume therefore that {a mathematical formula}Hμ≠∅.Let w be any world in {a mathematical formula}min⁡([μ],⪯). Clearly, {a mathematical formula}w∈[μ]. Moreover, by the definition of ⪯, and the minimality of w in {a mathematical formula}[μ], it follows that w is a model of every fallback set {a mathematical formula}Hi such that {a mathematical formula}[Hi] contains at least one μ-world {a mathematical formula}w′. In other words, w is a model of every fallback set consistent with μ, and consequently, w is also a model of {a mathematical formula}Hμ. Thus {a mathematical formula}w∈[(Hμ∪μ)]. This proves {a mathematical formula}min⁡([μ],⪯)⊆[(Hμ∪μ)]. For the converse, assume that w is a world in {a mathematical formula}[(Hμ∪μ)]. Then w is a μ-world that is also a model of {a mathematical formula}Hμ. Consider now any world {a mathematical formula}w′∈[μ] and assume that {a mathematical formula}w′ is a model of some fallback set {a mathematical formula}Hi; i.e. {a mathematical formula}w′∈[Hi]. Since {a mathematical formula}Hμ is the first fallback set consistent with μ, it follows that {a mathematical formula}Hi doesn't appear earlier than {a mathematical formula}Hμ in the sequence of fallback sets. Moreover, since fallback sets become progressively (logically) weaker, and given that {a mathematical formula}w∈[Hμ], it follows that {a mathematical formula}w∈[Hi]. Consequently, {a mathematical formula}w⪯w′. Since {a mathematical formula}w′ was chosen as an arbitrary μ-world we derive that {a mathematical formula}w∈min⁡([μ],⪯). Hence {a mathematical formula}[(Hμ∪μ)]⊆min⁡([μ],⪯).  □

       We conclude this section with a discussion on the computational complexity of canonical Horn revision. Assume that the set {a mathematical formula}P of propositional variables has m elements, and let k be the number of Horn clauses of the initial belief base {a mathematical formula}H0. Then, by construction, every fallback set {a mathematical formula}Hi has no more than k clauses. Given that each Horn clause can have up to {a mathematical formula}m+1 literals,{sup:18} it follows that each {a mathematical formula}Hi can be constructed in time {a mathematical formula}O(k⁎m). Hence a crude algorithm for computing the canonical Horn revision of {a mathematical formula}H0 by a Horn formula μ would be to construct sequentially the fallback sets {a mathematical formula}H1,H2,… , until we reach a set {a mathematical formula}Hμ that is consistent with μ (or define {a mathematical formula}Hμ=∅ if all fallback sets are inconsistent with μ); then return {a mathematical formula}Hμ∪μ as the result of revision. Let us denote by n the length of the entire input.{sup:19} Since the construction of each fallback set, and testing its consistency with μ can be performed in time {a mathematical formula}O(n2), and moreover, there are at most m fallback sets, the time complexity of the whole computation is no greater than {a mathematical formula}O(n3). We can improve on that if instead of searching sequentially for {a mathematical formula}Hμ, we use binary search; doing so reduces the complexity to {a mathematical formula}O(n2log⁡n).

      Discussion
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      In this paper, we have investigated belief revision in Horn clause theories. We showed that AGM belief revision doesn't immediately generalise to the Horn case and that, in the naïve extension of AGM revision to Horn clause theories, several problems arise. We address these issues by first restricting the semantic construction involving faithful rankings to “well behaved” orderings, those that we call Horn compliant. As well, we augment the revision postulates by an additional postulate (Acyc).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Notably, these results represent an extension rather than a modification of the AGM approach. That is, we have redefined (AGM-style) revision in the context of a logic, Horn logic, that is weaker than propositional logic. Postulates consist of (H*1)–(H*8) and (Acyc), while the construction is in terms of Horn compliant faithful rankings. This however subsumes classical AGM revision: classical propositional logic obviously is stronger than Horn logic. In classical propositional logic the notion corresponding to Horn compliance is trivial, since (over a finite alphabet) for any formula ϕ of propositional logic, {a mathematical formula}min⁡([ϕ],⪯) is definable via a formula of propositional logic. On the postulational side, as we showed, (Acyc) is derivable from the other postulates in the context of classical propositional logic. What this means, in other words, is that if one takes the approach developed herein, but replaces Horn logic by classical propositional logic, one ends up with the standard AGM approach.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We also showed that Horn revision is compatible with work in iterated revision and work concerning relevance in revision. We also considered specific revision operators: while the analogues of Dalah- and Satoh-style revision are incompatible with Horn revision, we proposed two specific revision operators, both with good complexity characteristics.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      These results suggest several (in our opinion) very interesting directions for future work. First, we argued that AGM revision can be extended by weakening the underlying logic to that of Horn logic. This raises the issue of whether the overall framework can be generalised to subsume other weakened inference relations, while maintaining the overall AGM character as reflected in the standard AGM postulates.

      The broader area of belief change in Horn theories is in the process of being mapped out. Other research has characterized Horn contraction, while the present paper has addressed revision. However, with the exception of [32], which considers the definition of Horn revision in terms of contraction, there has been no work that we are aware of in linking the areas of Horn contraction and revision. Moreover, the constructions in Horn contraction have focussed on the standard contraction constructions of remainder sets and epistemic entrenchment, while the present work has used the standard revision construction of a faithful ranking. Hence there is also a disconnect in the underlying formal characterizations. Consequently, research on linking Horn contraction and revision would help shed further light on the foundations of belief change.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Last, there is burgeoning interest in addressing belief change in description logics (see [26] for instance) or in analogous areas such as ontology evolution. Given that a Horn clause may also find interpretation as a subsumption, by mapping a rule {a mathematical formula}p→q to a subsumption of the form {a mathematical formula}P⊑Q, the present approach may also shed light on approaches to revision in description logics.
