      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Recently, in [5], a new nonmonotonic description logic called {a mathematical formula}DLN has been introduced with the goal of supporting ontology authoring by means of nonmonotonic reasoning. {a mathematical formula}DLN aims at removing some recurrent drawbacks of traditional nonmonotonic DLs{sup:1} such as: (i) inheritance blocking, that is a drawback of preferential semantics and rational closure; (ii) undesired closed world assumption effects, that affect circumscription, typicality logic and some probabilistic logics; (iii) the inability to specify whether roles shall range over normal/prototypical individuals or not, that affects most nonmonotonic DLs. Moreover, {a mathematical formula}DLN adopts a novel conflict resolution mechanism that helps in detecting unresolved conflicts between mutually inconsistent defaults. Since unresolved conflicts frequently correspond to missing knowledge, highlighting such conflicts constitutes an important support to knowledge base debugging and validation. A further useful property of {a mathematical formula}DLN is that it can be translated into classical DLs, so that its implementations can rely on mature and well-optimized inference engines. The translation can be computed in polynomial time and does not involve complex constructs, so {a mathematical formula}DLN preserves the tractability of the two major low-complexity families of DLs, that is {a mathematical formula}EL and DL-lite, that correspond to the EL and QL profiles of OWL2, respectively. The experiments in [5], [11] show unparalleled scalability properties over large knowledge bases, with more than 10{sup:5} axioms. The relationships between the above features and the knowledge engineering requirements that have been independently introduced in the fields of biomedical ontologies and declarative policy languages have been extensively discussed in [5].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The number and complexity of the issues dealt with in [5] led us to postpone the analysis of the logical properties of {a mathematical formula}DLN. The main goal of this paper is precisely studying the logical properties of its consequence relation, defeasible axioms and normal instances. Our analysis includes a comparison of {a mathematical formula}DLN's inferences with verbatim and internalized versions of the KLM postulates [29]. For our purposes, these postulates are not necessarily desiderata, due to the loose correspondence between their motivations and {a mathematical formula}DLN's goals and semantics. However, we regard them as a useful technical tool for profiling and comparing the behavior of different logics, since the validity (or non-validity) of the postulates has been extensively investigated in the context of most nonmonotonic logics.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      As a second contribution, we fix a problem affecting the original version of {a mathematical formula}DLN, that does not fully satisfy an internalized version of the KLM postulate LLE (left logical equivalence) and fails to derive some natural equivalences. The refined semantics improves also another foundational aspect: while the original definition of overriding quantifies over the class of all interpretations, the refined version depends only on a proper set of interpretations, thereby preventing any form of unrestricted comprehension[27]. We adapt the translation of {a mathematical formula}DLN into classical description logic accordingly and prove its correctness, fixing a minor error in [5].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Finally, we leverage on two features that make {a mathematical formula}DLN an excellent playground for analysing the interplay of the KLM postulates with other principles and requirements. First, {a mathematical formula}DLN's syntax is relatively rich: it is a first-order language, where standard individuals can be denoted through suitable concept expressions. This feature makes it possible to encode examples that cannot be modeled in several other nonmonotonic DLs (nor in the original, propositional KLM framework). The second useful feature is that the underlying monotonic semantics is relatively weak, in comparison with other richer formalisms such as typicality logic; all logical properties follow from classical logic and the elementary principle that all defaults should be applied unless they are contradicted by a group of higher priority (possibly non-defeasible) axioms. This helps in identifying what needs to be added to the aforementioned principle – that is the core of default reasoning [37], [30] – if one desired to satisfy the KLM postulates in a default description logic. Using these technical tools, we shall compare {a mathematical formula}DLN with other similar DLs in terms of the different tradeoffs between opposite desiderata stemming from the postulates, the above principle, and the emerging knowledge engineering requirements mentioned above.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In the next section, we recall some preliminaries on description logics, {a mathematical formula}DLN, and the KLM postulates, plus the basics of the two families of nonmonotonic DLs, that will be used as term of comparison in discussing logical properties and different ways of achieving them. In Section 3, we study the properties of the consequence relation of {a mathematical formula}DLN. Then a few sections analyze the logical behavior of expressions that are syntactically similar to constructs of other logics. In particular, Section 4 illustrates the behavior of defeasible inclusions by analogy with the defaults by Reiter and Lehmann. Section 5 describes the properties of the concepts that denote standard instances, and discusses internalized KLM postulates in relation to {a mathematical formula}DLN's characteristic features. In Section 6 we refine the semantics of {a mathematical formula}DLN to remove the aforementioned drawbacks. Finally, Section 7 completes the review of related work and Section 8 summarizes the results of the paper. The reader is assumed to be moderately familiar with nonmonotonic logics and description logics. Proofs have been moved to the appendix to improve readability.

      <paragraph>
       In DLs, concepts are inductively defined with the help of a set of constructors, starting with a set {a mathematical formula}NC of concept names, a set {a mathematical formula}NR of role names, and a set {a mathematical formula}NI of individual names (all countably infinite). We use the term predicate to refer to elements of {a mathematical formula}NC∪NR. Metavariables A, B will range over concept names, C and D over (possibly compound) concepts, R and S over roles, and a, b and d over individual names.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Expressive DLs support a large number of constructors; Fig. 1 illustrates some of them that will be used throughout the examples of this paper.{sup:2} Additionally, we shall adopt the usual abbreviation: {a mathematical formula}∃R=∃R.⊤.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The semantics of DLs is defined in terms of interpretations{a mathematical formula}I=(ΔI,⋅I). The domain{a mathematical formula}ΔI is a non-empty set of individuals and the interpretation function{a mathematical formula}⋅I maps each concept name {a mathematical formula}A∈NC to a subset {a mathematical formula}AI of {a mathematical formula}ΔI, each role name {a mathematical formula}R∈NR to a binary relation {a mathematical formula}RI on {a mathematical formula}ΔI, and each individual name {a mathematical formula}a∈NI to an individual {a mathematical formula}aI∈ΔI. The extension of {a mathematical formula}⋅I to inverse roles and some common compound concepts is inductively defined as shown in the third column of Fig. 1. An interpretation {a mathematical formula}I is called a model of a concept C if {a mathematical formula}CI≠∅. If {a mathematical formula}I is a model of C, we also say that C is satisfied by {a mathematical formula}I.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       A (general) TBox is a finite set of concept inclusions (CIs){a mathematical formula}C⊑D. As usual, we use {a mathematical formula}C≡D as an abbreviation for {a mathematical formula}C⊑D and {a mathematical formula}D⊑C. An ABox is a finite set of concept assertions{a mathematical formula}C(a) and role assertions{a mathematical formula}R(a,b). An interpretation {a mathematical formula}Isatisfies (i) a concept inclusion {a mathematical formula}C⊑D if {a mathematical formula}CI⊆DI, (ii) an assertion {a mathematical formula}C(a) if {a mathematical formula}aI∈CI, and (iii) an assertion {a mathematical formula}R(a,b) if {a mathematical formula}(aI,bI)∈RI. Then, {a mathematical formula}I is a (classical) model of a TBox {a mathematical formula}T (resp. an ABox {a mathematical formula}A) if {a mathematical formula}I satisfies all the members of {a mathematical formula}T (resp. {a mathematical formula}A).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In this paper we mention some important DLs that have been extensively studied in the literature and constitute the foundation of semantic web standards. The logic {a mathematical formula}ALC is defined by the following grammar, where R ranges over role names:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The logic {a mathematical formula}EL supports only ⊤, ⊓, and ∃. Its extension {a mathematical formula}EL⊥ supports also ⊥. The logic {a mathematical formula}EL++ further adds concrete domains and some expressive role inclusions (see [2] for further details).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The logic DL-lite [18] supports inclusions shaped like {a mathematical formula}C⊑D and {a mathematical formula}C⊑¬D, where C and D range over concept names and unqualified existential restrictions such as ∃R and {a mathematical formula}∃R− (where {a mathematical formula}R∈NR). {a mathematical formula}EL++ and DL-lite, respectively, constitute the foundation of the OWL2 profiles OWL2-EL and OWL2-QL. Both play an important role in applications; their inference problems are tractable (the same holds for some extensions of DL-lite, see [1]).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Finally we mention the very expressive DL {a mathematical formula}SROIQ that constitutes the foundation of the full standard OWL2. Inference in this logic is 2NExpTime-complete [28].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       {a mathematical formula}SROIQ supports the universal role U that, in turn, can express boolean combinations of inclusions and assertions. For example, {a mathematical formula}¬(C⊑D) can be expressed as {a mathematical formula}⊤⊑∃U.(C⊓¬D), and {a mathematical formula}(C1⊑D1)∨(C2⊑D2) can be expressed as {a mathematical formula}⊤⊑(∀U.(¬C1⊔D1))⊔(∀U.(¬C2⊔D2)).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Some boolean combinations can be expressed without U. For instance, with the help of an auxiliary role, {a mathematical formula}¬(C⊑D) can be expressed as {a mathematical formula}⊤⊑∃aux.(C⊓¬D). Moreover, {a mathematical formula}({a}⊑{b})∨({a}⊑{c}) is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}{a}⊑{b,c} and{a mathematical formula} Some boolean combinations of DL axioms occur in the KLM postulates and play a role in some of our results.

      The basics of {a mathematical formula}DLN
      <paragraph>
       Let {a mathematical formula}DL be any classical description logic language and let {a mathematical formula}DLN be the extension of {a mathematical formula}DL with a new concept name {a mathematical formula}NC for each {a mathematical formula}DL concept C. The new concepts are called normality concepts and denote the standard instances of C.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       A canonical{a mathematical formula}DLNknowledge base (hereafter knowledge base, for simplicity) is a disjoint union {a mathematical formula}KB=S∪D where {a mathematical formula}S is a finite set of {a mathematical formula}DL inclusions and assertions (called strong or classical axioms) and {a mathematical formula}D is a finite set of defeasible inclusions (DIs, for short) that are expressions {a mathematical formula}C⊑nD where C is a {a mathematical formula}DL concept and D a {a mathematical formula}DLN concept.{sup:3} If {a mathematical formula}δ=(C⊑nD), then {a mathematical formula}pre(δ) and {a mathematical formula}con(δ) denote C and D, respectively.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The informal meaning of {a mathematical formula}C⊑nD, roughly speaking, is: “by default, standard instances satisfy{a mathematical formula}C⊑D, unless stated otherwise”, that is, unless some higher priority (possibly strong) axioms entail that standard instances belong to {a mathematical formula}C⊓¬D; in that case, {a mathematical formula}C⊑nD is overridden. The standard instances of a concept C are required to satisfy all the DIs that are not overridden in C. Accordingly, we will call the set of DIs satisfied by {a mathematical formula}NC the prototype associated to C.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       DIs are prioritized by a strict partial order ≺. If {a mathematical formula}δ1≺δ2, then {a mathematical formula}δ1 has higher priority than {a mathematical formula}δ2. {a mathematical formula}DLN solves automatically only the conflicts that can be settled using ≺. Any other conflict shall be resolved by the knowledge engineer (typically by adding specific DIs). Two priority relations have been investigated so far. Both are based on specificity: the specific default properties of a concept C have higher priority than the more generic properties of its superconcepts (i.e. those that subsume C). The priority relation used in most of the examples of [5] collects those superconcepts with strong axioms only:{a mathematical formula}The second priority relation investigated in [5] is{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}rank(⋅) is shown in Algorithm 1 and corresponds to the ranking function of rational closure adopted in [20], [22]. This relation uses also DIs to determine superconcepts, so (roughly speaking) a DI {a mathematical formula}C⊑nD – besides defining a default property for C – gives the specific default properties of C higher priority than those of D. The advantage of this priority relation is that it resolves more conflicts than (1); the main advantage of (1) is predictability; e.g. the effects of adding default properties to an existing, classical KB are more predictable, as the hierarchy used for determining specificity and resolving conflicts is the original, validated one, and is not affected by the new DIs (see also the related discussion in [6], [7], that adopt (1)).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The expression {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}α means that α is a {a mathematical formula}DLNconsequence of {a mathematical formula}KB. Here we do not report the model-theoretic definition of {an inline-figure} (an improved version will be given in Sec. 6) and present only its reduction to classical reasoning. For all {a mathematical formula}DLN subsumptions and assertions α, {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}α holds iff {a mathematical formula}KBΣ⊨α, where Σ is any set of normality concepts that contains at least the normality concepts that explicitly occur in {a mathematical formula}KB∪{α}, and {a mathematical formula}KBΣ is a classical knowledge base obtained as follows (recall that {a mathematical formula}KB=S∪D):
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       First, for all DIs {a mathematical formula}δ∈D and all {a mathematical formula}NC∈Σ, let:{a mathematical formula} The informal meaning of {a mathematical formula}δNC is: “{a mathematical formula}NC's instances satisfy δ”.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Second, let {a mathematical formula}↓≺δ be the operator that removes from axiom sets all the {a mathematical formula}δ0NC that do not have higher priority than δ, protecting the strong axioms of {a mathematical formula}KB{sup:5}:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Third, let {a mathematical formula}δ1,…,δ|D| be any linearization of {a mathematical formula}(D,≺).{sup:6}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Finally, let {a mathematical formula}KBΣ=KB|D|Σ, where the sequence {a mathematical formula}KBiΣ ({a mathematical formula}i=1,2,…,|D|) is inductively defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} (note that {a mathematical formula}KBi⊆KBi+1, {a mathematical formula}i=1,2,…,|D|).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In other words, the above sequence starts with {a mathematical formula}KB's strong axioms extended with the inclusions {a mathematical formula}NC⊑C, then processes the DIs {a mathematical formula}δi in non-increasing priority order. If {a mathematical formula}δi can be consistently added to C's prototype, given all higher priority DIs selected so far (which is verified by checking that {a mathematical formula}NC⋢⊥ in line (5)), then its translation {a mathematical formula}δiNC is included in {a mathematical formula}KBΣ (i.e. {a mathematical formula}δi enters C's prototype), otherwise {a mathematical formula}δi is discarded, and we say that {a mathematical formula}δi is overridden in{a mathematical formula}NC.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We conclude this section with two technical remarks. First, in order to answer a given query α, it suffices to use the {a mathematical formula}KBΣ obtained from the smallest possible Σ, that contains only the normality concepts explicitly occurring in {a mathematical formula}KB and α; however, larger Σ may be optionally used to pre-compute the properties of frequently used normality concepts, for optimization purposes (i.e. reusing the same {a mathematical formula}KBΣ for many queries). Second, choosing the linearization is not an issue, since they all yield the same result (cf. [5, Remark 2]).

        A note on usage
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        {a mathematical formula}DLN has two constructs for handling nonmonotonic inferences: defeasible inclusions and normality concepts. Defeasible inclusions are meant to specify the default properties of the standard instances denoted by normality concepts; so DIs do not affect the other predicates. For example, even if standard birds fly by default, still concept Bird contains instances that do not fly. Concepts Bird and {a mathematical formula}NBird are not induced to be as similar as possible by {a mathematical formula}DLN's semantics, in order to avoid undesired closed-world effects, cf. [5].{sup:7}
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Conversely, a normality concept {a mathematical formula}NC is meant to be axiomatized by the strong (monotonic) properties of C plus the default properties specified by DIs. So the correct way of asserting that standard birds fly by default is by means of the defeasible inclusion {a mathematical formula}NBird⊑nFlying and not through the strong inclusion {a mathematical formula}NBird⊑Flying, as the latter cannot be possibly overridden. This explains the rationale behind canonical knowledge bases, that by definition prevent the usage of normality concepts in strong axioms.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Since the effects of defeasible inclusions are confined to normality concepts, if a query Q contains no such concepts, then it is about certain, valid knowledge; accordingly, Q is entailed by {a mathematical formula}KB if and only it follows classically from the strong axioms of {a mathematical formula}KB. On the contrary, if we are interested in inspecting the defeasible consequences of {a mathematical formula}KB, then Q should contain some normality concepts. For instance, in order to check whether standard birds fly by default, Q should be {a mathematical formula}NBird⊑Flying. Here {a mathematical formula}Bird⊑nFlying is not the correct query to pose, because even if a DI is a consequence of {a mathematical formula}KB, it can be overridden, and in this case it has no effect (a DI δ is entailed if for all normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NC, δ is either satisfied by the instances {a mathematical formula}NC or overridden in {a mathematical formula}NC, cf. [5] and Section 6). This behavior of DIs is further discussed in Section 4. Inferring DIs may turn out to be useful for other purposes related to optimization, such as removing redundant DIs from a knowledge base.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Summarizing, in the typical examples of nonmonotonic reasoning occurring in the literature, DIs occur only in the knowledge base, while strong inclusions involving normality concepts occur only in queries.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Finally, a caveat on the intended meaning of normality concepts. Their name suggests that they are meant to collect the typical or normal instances of a concept, while their intended usage is actually more general, which is why we rather use the term “standard instances”. To illustrate this idea, we anticipate one of the examples below, namely, the default inheritance of drug contraindications. It has been proposed by Rector not really because those contraindications normally hold, but rather because it is less dangerous to infer more contraindications than missing some of them. In this case, the properties of normality concepts are not determined by what we expect to hold in the world, but rather by what we deem safer to assume. Another opportunistic approach like this – where default properties are determined by what is more useful to assume – will be illustrated in Example 7. This category of intended applications departs from the goal of modelling what normally holds, that is the major motivation behind the KLM postulates.

        Examples
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        We start by illustrating {a mathematical formula}DLN's conflict handling approach, that has been motivated by knowledge engineering requirements stemming from biomedical applications and from the needs of semantic web policies. Most other logics silently neutralize the conflicts between nonmonotonic axioms with equal or incomparable priorities by computing the inferences that are invariant across all possible ways of resolving the conflict. A knowledge engineer, using her domain knowledge, may want to solve the conflict in favor of some of its possible resolutions, by adding specific axioms; however, if the logic silently neutralizes the conflict, then such missing knowledge may remain undetected and unfixed. This approach may cause serious problems in the policy domain:
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Example 1">
        Suppose that project coordinators are both administrative staff and research staff. By default, administrative staff are allowed to sign payments, while research staff are not. A conflict arises since both of these default policies apply to project coordinators. Formally, {a mathematical formula}KB can be formalized with:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Leaving the conflict unresolved may cause a variety of security problems. If project coordinators should not sign payments, and the default policy is open (authorizations are granted by default), then failing to infer {a mathematical formula}¬∃has_right.Sign would improperly authorize signatures. Conversely, if the authorization is to be granted and the policy is closed, then failing to prove {a mathematical formula}∃has_right.Sign causes a denial of service (the user is unable to complete a legal operation). To prevent these problems, {a mathematical formula}DLN makes the conflict visible by inferring {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}NPrjCrd⊑⊥ (i.e. making PrjCrd's prototype inconsistent). Technically, this can be proved by checking that {a mathematical formula}KBΣ⊨NPrjCrd⊑⊥, where {a mathematical formula}Σ={NPrjCrd}. Here {a mathematical formula}KBΣ consists of (8), {a mathematical formula}NPrjCrd⊑PrjCrd, and the following translations of (6)and(7) (none of which overrides the other because none is more specific under any of the two priorities):{a mathematical formula} Now it is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}NPrjCrd is indeed inconsistent in {a mathematical formula}KBΣ. Given this warning, a knowledge engineer can easily add the missing information by asserting either {a mathematical formula}PrjCrd⊑n∃has_right.Sign or {a mathematical formula}PrjCrd⊑n¬∃has_right.Sign.  □
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        The conflict handling mechanism of {a mathematical formula}DLN is useful also in other advocated applications of nonmonotonic reasoning. One of them is the mitigation of risks due to human errors. For example, contraindications may be associated to new drugs by default, unless explicitly stated otherwise, to prevent the risk of forgetting some of them. However, if a drug belongs to two or more drug families, then multiple inheritance may cause unresolvable conflicts, that prevent the correct contraindications from being inherited. If such conflicts were silently removed, then the missing contraindications might remain unnoticed, while in {a mathematical formula}DLN the potential loss of crucial information would be signaled through a concept's inconsistency, by analogy with the above example. This application of nonmonotonic reasoning has been suggested in [36] and its encoding in {a mathematical formula}DLN has been discussed in [5, Appendix C].
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        We proceed with another application example from the semantic policy domain, that shows {a mathematical formula}DLN's behavior on multiple exception levels.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Example 2">
        We are going to axiomatize the following natural language policy: “In general, users cannot access confidential files; Staff can read confidential files; Blacklisted users are not granted any access. This directive cannot be overridden.” Note that each of the above directives contradicts (and is supposed to override) its predecessor in some particular case. Authorizations can be reified as objects with attributes subject (the access requestor), target (the file to be accessed), and privilege (such as read and write). Then the above policy can be encoded as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}BlkReq=∃subj.Blklst, {a mathematical formula}StaffReqst=∃subj.Staff, and {a mathematical formula}UserReqst=∃subj.User. By (9), both of the specifity relations yield {a mathematical formula}(12)≺(11), that is, (12) has higher priority than (11) under priority (1) as well as (2). Let {a mathematical formula}Σ={NStaffReqst}; (12) overrides (11) in {a mathematical formula}NStaffReqst so {a mathematical formula}KBΣ consists of: (9), (10), (13), plus{a mathematical formula} Consequently, {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}NStaffReqst⊑∃privilege.Read.

       <paragraph>
        Some application examples from the biomedical domain can be found in [5] (see Examples 3, 4, 10, 12, and the drug contraindication example in Appendix C). Like the above examples, they are all correctly solved by {a mathematical formula}DLN with both priority notions. The examples inspired by applications hardly exhibit the complicated networks of dependencies between conflicting defaults that occur in artificial examples. Nonetheless, we briefly discuss such examples, too, as a means of comparing {a mathematical formula}DLN with other logics such as [38], [22], [8].
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        In several cases, e.g. Examples B.4 and B.5 in [38], {a mathematical formula}DLN agrees with [38], [22], [8] under both priority relations. Since these examples have similar features, here we illustrate only B.4, as a representative case.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Example 3">
        Juvenile offenderLet {a mathematical formula}KB consist of axioms (14)–(18) where J, G, M, P abbreviate JuvenileOffender, GuiltyOfCrime, IsMinor and ToBePunished, respectively.{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} On one hand, criminals have to be punished and, on the other hand, minors cannot be punished. So, what about juvenile offenders? The defeasible inclusion (16) breaks the tie in favor of their being underage, hence not punishable. By setting {a mathematical formula}Σ={NJ}, priorities (1) and (2) both return axioms (19)–(23) as {a mathematical formula}KBΣ. Then, clearly, {a mathematical formula}KBΣ⊨NJ⊑¬P which is {a mathematical formula}DLN's analogue of the inferences of [38], [22], [8].  □
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Example 4">
        In other cases (e.g. Example B.1 in [38]) {a mathematical formula}DLN finds the same conflicts as [38], [22], [8]. However, {a mathematical formula}DLN's semantics signals these conflicts to the knowledge engineer whereas in [38], [22], [8] they are silently neutralized. Double diamondLet {a mathematical formula}KB be the following set of axioms:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} DIs (26) and (27) have incomparable priority under (1) and (2). Consequently, it is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}NA⊑S and {a mathematical formula}NA⊑¬S are both implied by {a mathematical formula}KBΣ and hence the knowledge engineer is warned that {a mathematical formula}NA is inconsistent. The same conflict is silently neutralized in [22], [38], [8] (A's instances are subsumed by neither S nor {a mathematical formula}¬S and no inconsistency arises). Similarly for the incomparable DIs (28) and (30) and the related conflict.  □

        The third category of examples (e.g. B.2 and B.3 in [38]) presents a more variegated behavior. In particular, using priority (2), both [22] and {a mathematical formula}DLN solve all conflicts and infer the same consequences; [38] solves only some conflicts; [8] is not able to solve any conflict and yet it does not raise any inconsistency warning; {a mathematical formula}DLN with priority (1) cannot solve the conflicts but raises an inconsistency warning. Here, for the sake of simplicity, we discuss in detail a shorter example which has all relevant ingredients.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Example 5">
        Let {a mathematical formula}KB be the following defeasible knowledge base:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} According to priority (1) all DIs are incomparable. Therefore, {a mathematical formula}DLN warns (by inferring {a mathematical formula}NA⊑⊥) that the conflict between {a mathematical formula}NA⊑C and {a mathematical formula}NA⊑¬C cannot be solved. Note that [8] adopts priority (1), too, however according to circumscription, any interpretation where A's instances are either in {a mathematical formula}¬C⊓B or in C is a model, so A is satisfiable (the conflict is silently neutralized). Under priority (2), instead, axiom (31) gives (31) itself and (32) higher priority than (33). Consequently, {a mathematical formula}NA⊑C prevails over {a mathematical formula}NA⊑¬C. In this case, {a mathematical formula}DLN and rational closure infer the same consequences.  □
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        There is a reason why the inferences of {a mathematical formula}DLN are so similar to those of [22] in the above examples. We will show in the following sections that {a mathematical formula}DLN and [22] satisfy similar versions of a set of standard postulates (called KLM postulates) in all the examples where the characteristic features of {a mathematical formula}DLN do not come into play. This is why the above examples show the different behavior of {a mathematical formula}DLN only in the presence of unresolved conflicts. Further differences will emerge in Section 5.2 from the restriction of role values to normal individuals – a feature that is not considered in the above examples and that is not supported by [22].

       The KLM postulates
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In their seminal papers, Makinson [34] and Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor [29], [32], [30] study the consequence relations of nonmonotonic logics from an axiomatic perspective. In order to develop a general framework, compatible with the variety of nonmonotonic languages and semantics introduced in the literature, they abstract away the details of nonmonotonic expressions and focus on the classical information that such expressions deduce from the available classical description of the world.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For example, consider Reiter's default theories [37]: they are pairs {a mathematical formula}〈D,W〉 where D is a set of default rules and W is a set of classical sentences. Every set of defaults D is associated to the consequence relation {a mathematical formula}CnD(⋅) that maps each possible W on the set of classical sentences that can be derived from W using the default rules in D[34]. In later works, an equivalent representation in terms of sequents is adopted. For instance, {a mathematical formula}CnD(⋅) can be equivalently represented as the set of all pairs of sentences {a mathematical formula}(ω,ϕ) such that ω is the conjunction of W's sentences, and {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈CnD(W). Such sequents are usually denoted by {a mathematical formula}ω{an inline-figure}ϕ. Note that {an inline-figure} embodies the background knowledge represented by D, hiding both its semantic contents and its syntactic representation.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor argued that in order to reason about what normally holds in the world, it is desirable to make nonmonotonic consequence relations closed under certain properties, called KLM postulates, from the initials of their authors. The verbatim instantiation of the original postulates, using {a mathematical formula}DLN's terminology, is illustrated in Table 1. Here, the background knowledge hidden in {an inline-figure} is made explicit by the term {a mathematical formula}KB, and each entailment of the form {a mathematical formula}KB∪{α}{an inline-figure}β corresponds to the sequent {a mathematical formula}α{an inline-figure}β, by analogy with the above example about default logic. Through this correspondence, one gets precisely the original postulates. A consequence relation that satisfies the KLM postulates is called rational. It is called preferential if it satisfies all rules but RM, and cumulative if it satisfies all rules but RM and OR.{sup:8}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In their abstract analysis of nonmonotonic consequence relations, Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor found it helpful to identify nonmonotonic theories with the set of sequents {a mathematical formula}ω{an inline-figure}ϕ that constitute their consequence relations, so as to make their arguments independent from any concrete syntax for defeasible information. Then, some authors found it natural to turn these sequents (that originally were metalevel expressions that describe the effects of a theory) into object-level expressions that are the theory itself, whose semantics can be specified – say – by the KLM postulates and their model-theoretic accounts, or by the rational closure construction. Some examples of this approach in DLs are [20], [21], [22], [19], [16]. This internalization operation transformed the KLM postulates from a general analysis tool – applicable to any logic – into a specific logic, just like default logic, autoepistemic logic or circumscription.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       According to the above discussion, we shall use the metalevel version reported in Table 1 as the analysis tool to study {an inline-figure}, i.e. the consequence relation of {a mathematical formula}DLN, and compare it with those of Default, Autoepistemic, and Circumscribed DLs. This metalevel analysis will be refined and extended by using two internalized versions of the KLM postulates in order to clarify the meaning of {a mathematical formula}DLN expressions such as {a mathematical formula}C⊑nD and {a mathematical formula}NC⊑D, that syntactically resemble the internalized conditionals {a mathematical formula}ω{an inline-figure}ϕ but actually have different semantics. The internalized postulates help also in comparing {a mathematical formula}DLN with Lehmann's default logic and with the description logics illustrated in the following section.

       Two families of DLs satisfying internalized KLM postulates
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Along the following sections, we shall refer to two families of nonmonotonic DLs that provide a natural reference point for comparison and illustrate different ways of supporting internalized KLM postulates. These logics have been selected precisely because they have been designed to satisfy such postulates (or most of them), unlike circumscribed and autoepistemic DLs, just to name a few.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The first family is obtained by applying the rational closure construction or variants thereof to {a mathematical formula}ALC, using sequents {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure}D as knowledge base axioms that informally mean: “normally, the instances of C satisfy D” [20], [21], [22], [19], [16].{sup:9} The priority relation over these axioms is given by the rank computed by Algorithm 1. The symbol {an inline-figure} is part of the object-level language, and can be used both in knowledge bases and in queries. Unlike {a mathematical formula}DLN, there are no constructs for denoting the normal instances of a concept. We shall refer to these logics as DLs based on Rational Closure. In these logics role values cannot be restricted to normal individuals; equivalently, defeasible assertions do not apply to role values. Recently, a dual logic where roles range on normal individuals but inclusions are classical has been studied in [14]. Most DLs based on rational closure satisfy the following internalized version of the KLM postulates:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       {a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The only exception is the relevant closure introduced in [19], that in order to prevent inheritance blocking waives OR{a mathematical formula}RC, CM{a mathematical formula}RC, and RM{a mathematical formula}RC.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The second family, that we call typicality DLs, feature concepts {a mathematical formula}T(C) that denote the typical instances of C; they are analogues of the normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NC. The underlying monotonic logic is essentially a preferential modal logic whose semantics is based on a normality relation over individuals, that is illustrated below. Typicality DLs have no ad hoc construct for defeasible inclusions; the analogue of {a mathematical formula}C⊑nD and {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure}D is {a mathematical formula}T(C)⊑D. So, strictly speaking, in typicality logics the inclusions themselves are not defeasible; a statement like {a mathematical formula}T(C)⊑D cannot be overridden. Nonmonotonicity is obtained by minimizing atypical individuals, by a metalevel construction similar to circumscription [24], [25]. Interestingly, the expressions {a mathematical formula}T(C)⊑D are also syntactically similar to {a mathematical formula}DLN's inclusions {a mathematical formula}NC⊑D; their differences will be illustrated in Section 5. The logic {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin illustrated in [24] is preferential, while those in [25] are rational, relative to the following internalized KLM postulates:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       {a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Many of the logical properties of typicality DLs are forced by their monotonic fragments, such as {a mathematical formula}ALC+T and {a mathematical formula}ALC+TR. In each model {a mathematical formula}I, the degree of typicality is formalized with a partial order {a mathematical formula}≤I over individuals. The typical instances of a concept C, denoted by {a mathematical formula}T(C), are the {a mathematical formula}≤I-minimal instances of C, that is, its most typical members. Different typicality logics are obtained by tuning the properties of the relations {a mathematical formula}≤I. They are always assumed to satisfy a condition called smoothness that ensures that each nonempty concept has at least one {a mathematical formula}≤I-minimal instance; in other words, if C is consistent, then {a mathematical formula}T(C) is consistent, too. Note that {a mathematical formula}≤I does not depend on C, that is, a single, universal normality criterion is assumed. Informally speaking, this means that if John is more typical than Mary as a parent, then he must also be more typical than Mary as a driver, as a worker, as a tax payer, and so on. Some technical and practical consequences of this strong assumption are discussed in the following sections, mostly in Section 5.2.

     {a mathematical formula}DLN between cumulativity and rationality
     <paragraph>
      In this section we prove that the entailment relation of {a mathematical formula}DLN (that is {an inline-figure}) is cumulative, and that if normal instances are assumed to exist, then it becomes rational. In some logics this assumption is hardwired in the underlying monotonic logic, while in {a mathematical formula}DLN it must be explicitly stated through suitable axioms. This is related to {a mathematical formula}DLN's strategy for avoiding undesired closed-world effects; in particular, {a mathematical formula}DLN does not assume that any individual is normal by default, see [5] for an articulated discussion of this approach.

       The RM rule
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       This postulate can be analyzed through an extremely simple example: given the knowledge base{a mathematical formula} there is little doubt that all the standard instances of A should belong to B, that is,{a mathematical formula} There should also be little doubt that the strong axiom {a mathematical formula}A⊑¬B overrides the DI in {a mathematical formula}KB, so that{a mathematical formula} Given (34) and (35), RM can be satisfied only if{a mathematical formula} Now the question is: why should (36) hold? {a mathematical formula}KB only says that the normal instances of A are in B. Then, concluding that A is not included in ¬B is like assuming that at least one of such instances exists.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The assumption that each consistent concept has at least one normal instance is hardwired in the semantics of typicality logics, through smoothness.{sup:10} On the contrary, {a mathematical formula}DLN does not make this assumption, and for this reason RM does not always hold. This is witnessed by the above example, since (36) does not hold in {a mathematical formula}DLN. If normal instances were assumed to exist, then {a mathematical formula}DLN would satisfy RM, as well:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 2">
       Consider RM and the axiom γ occurring in it. Suppose that{a mathematical formula}KBcontains an axiom{a mathematical formula}¬(NC⊑⊥)(or equivalent formulations, cf. Sec.2.1) for each{a mathematical formula}NCoccurring in{a mathematical formula}KB∪{γ}such that C is satisfiable w.r.t.{a mathematical formula}KB. Then RM is sound.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Remark 1">
       Note that the knowledge base, in the above theorem, is not canonical; it is a general knowledge base where normality concepts occur in the strong part. In general, such unrestricted use of normality concepts may lead to undesirable inferences, by overriding the intended meaning carried by defeasible inclusions – which is why we focused on the canonical approach, cf. the note on usage in Section 2.2. However, if non-canonical axioms are carefully chosen, then non-canonical knowledge bases may become a useful tool for specializing {a mathematical formula}DLN and tuning the set of valid axioms to application needs (more examples will be given in the following sections). This approach does not have any major side-effects on the properties of {a mathematical formula}DLN since they all rely on the correctness of the translation {a mathematical formula}KBΣ, which has been proved in [5] for all general knowledge bases, not just canonical ones. The selective use of general knowledge bases as a means to achieve more flexibility is an interesting topic for further research.  □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The analysis of RM's effects on inconsistent prototypes is illuminating, too. Consider a standard case of unresolved conflict arising from multiple inheritance:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} In the above {a mathematical formula}KB, the prototype of C is inconsistent, i.e.{a mathematical formula} due to the conflicting DIs (37) and (38). The natural way of resolving such conflicts is specifying which alternative should hold for C, thereby overriding the other one. For instance, in our example, one might specify that {a mathematical formula}C⊑B and expect that{a mathematical formula} because {a mathematical formula}C⊑B clearly overrides (38). Now consider an instance of RM where {a mathematical formula}α=(C⊑B) and {a mathematical formula}γ=(NC⊑⊥). Given (40) and (41), that are the first premise and the negation of the conclusion, in order to satisfy RM, it is necessary that the second premise does not hold, that is,{a mathematical formula} and again the question is: why should (42) hold? Differently from the previous example, here {a mathematical formula}KB entails that {a mathematical formula}NC is empty, so the instances of C that belong to ¬B (that must exist if (42) holds) are not typical instances of C. It follows that enforcing RM in a logic like {a mathematical formula}DLN, that highlights unresolved conflicts through inconsistent prototypes, requires extending the effects of DIs from normal instances only to all individuals. We leave it as an open question whether this is appropriate, and how it should be done.

       The OR rule
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Similarly to RM, the OR rule depends on the assumption that normal individuals exist. To see this, we first illustrate a counterexample to OR. Let {a mathematical formula}KB be the following set of axioms:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} and let{a mathematical formula} Note that {a mathematical formula}α∨β is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}A⊑{c,d}, so it can be expressed in standard description logics. Here α cleary overrides (44) and β overrides (43), so the prototype of A is consistent in both {a mathematical formula}KB∪{α} and {a mathematical formula}KB∪{β}:{a mathematical formula} Since {a mathematical formula}NA is nonempty, (48) is not overridden and we have:{a mathematical formula} From these entailments, the OR rule derives {a mathematical formula}KB∪{α∨β}{an inline-figure}NB⊑∀R.C. However, this does not hold in {a mathematical formula}DLN. Axiom {a mathematical formula}α∨β is too weak to override any of (43) and (44), so their conflict remains unresolved and we have{a mathematical formula} As a consequence, (48) is overridden (as it would be inconsistent with (47)) and hence{a mathematical formula} Note that this counterexample exploits an empty normality concept. This is not by chance: similarly to RM, we can prove that {a mathematical formula}DLN satisfies OR when normal individuals are guaranteed to exist.

      The logical properties of DIs
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      From a crudely syntactic point of view, a defeasible inclusion {a mathematical formula}C⊑nD is similar to its counterpart {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure}D adopted by the DLs based on rational closure. So it may be tempting to assume that DIs should satisfy the same logical properties, including the KLM postulates. The corresponding internalized version is reported in Table 2.{sup:11}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The semantics of DIs, however, is different: while the expressions {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure}D are rational sequents, that are required to belong to the knowledge base's consequences, DIs express only default assertions that may be overridden and have no effect. In this respect, DIs are more similar to Reiter's default rules [37] and Lehmann's version thereof [30]; in particular, in Lehmann's terms, our DIs correspond to the default expressions {a mathematical formula}(ω:ϕ), not to the sequents {a mathematical formula}ω{an inline-figure}ϕ that represent the consequences of default expressions. Default rules have the following characteristic behavior: either they are overridden (and have no effect whatsoever, like tautologies) or they are applied; in the latter case, defaults have a pretty classical behavior (e.g. Lehmann's are equivalent to material implications). Indeed, if this aspect were not properly taken into account by distinguishing so-called “meaningful” (i.e. applied) defaults from overridden ones, then even Lehmann's account of default reasoning – which is built around the KLM postulates – would not be strictly rational; see the discussion in [30, Sec. 5 and 6].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The analogue of these properties in {a mathematical formula}DLN is cast into the semantics of DIs: δ is satisfied if for all concepts {a mathematical formula}NC, either δ is overridden in {a mathematical formula}NC or the corresponding classical inclusion {a mathematical formula}δNC holds. In particular, if δ is overridden in every {a mathematical formula}NC, then it is satisfied even if it has no effects.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Said so, it comes to no surprise that almost none of the rules in Table 2 is unconditionally sound. For example, the conclusion of RWn is justified by its first premise; if it were overridden, then the conclusion would not be supported. Moreover, the conclusion is weaker than the premise, so it is not necessarily overridden when the premise is. Rule CTn may even produce undesirable effects if it were forced in general (cf. Theorem 8 and the following discussion in [5]).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      However, as it should be expected, in line with the characteristic features of default reasoning, when the premises are not overridden, then all of the rules inTable 2are sound[5, Theorem 9]. In particular, REFn is always sound.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Actually, under pretty mild assumptions, some rules are sound also when their defeasible premises are overridden. Rule LLEn, for example, can be violated only by using bizarre priority relations, that depend on syntactic details and give logically equivalent DIs different priority. If the priority relation is not sensitive to syntactic details, then LLEn holds [5, Theorem 10]. In [5, Theorem 8], it has also been proved that ORn holds unconditionally under specificity, because this priority relation guarantees that the conclusion is overridden whenever both premises are overridden, thereby ensuring the rule's soundness.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Given that DIs are like defaults, it is interesting to compare {a mathematical formula}DLN's consequence relation with those of the other default logics; this will be done in detail in sections 7 and 8. We informally anticipate that {a mathematical formula}DLN (which is cumulative) lies somewhere in between Default DLs (which are not cumulative) and Lehmann's propositional default logic, which is rational [30]. With the additional assumption that consistent concepts have standard instances, the consequence relation of {a mathematical formula}DLN is rational, like that of Lehmann's default logic.

       The other axioms for ⊓ and ⊔ violate the goal of representing exceptions, too. Many motivational examples in the literature contradict and 2 and or 1. Consider, for instance, the semantic web policy where the authorizations for {a mathematical formula}NStaff and those for {a mathematical formula}NBlacklisted are mutually inconsistent (by default, everything is permitted to staff members while everything is strongly denied to blacklisted users). Then {a mathematical formula}NStaff⊓NBlacklisted is inconsistent, so and 2 would make the concept {a mathematical formula}N(Staff⊓Blacklisted) inconsistent, too. On the contrary, the expected behavior is that the strong negative authorizations of blacklisted members override the default authorizations granted to staff members, so {a mathematical formula}N(Staff⊓Blacklisted) should be consistent. Next, consider the instance of or 1 where C is Staff and D is User (recall that {a mathematical formula}Staff⊑User). Rule or 1 forces {a mathematical formula}N(Staff⊔User) – whose instances should not have any access rights – to contain {a mathematical formula}NStaff, whose instances do have read permission. Neither and 2 nor or 1 are valid in {a mathematical formula}DLN.

       Drawbacks of or 2A knowledge engineer shall encode the results of a marketing study in a knowledge base. Suppose that most people younger than 40 (denoted by concept Y) would drive a sport car, most people between 40 and 60 (denoted by M) would drive an agile city car, and most people over 60 (denoted by E) would drive a comfortable luxury car, while the rest of people would opt for a mid-sized car with low fuel consumption. To make calculations simpler, assume that in each case the majority amounts to 60% of the group, that people are equally distributed across the three age ranges, and that the four categories of cars are mutually disjoint. It seems natural to encode this knowledge by asserting that the instances of {a mathematical formula}NY, {a mathematical formula}NM, and {a mathematical formula}NE would choose by default a sport car, a city car or a luxury car, respectively. If we look at all people, though, (i.e. {a mathematical formula}Y⊔M⊔E), we see that mid-sized cars get the largest share (40%, that is twice as large as any other choice, and ceteris paribus this ratio would grow further if there were more than 3 user categories). Therefore, the knowledge engineer may want to factorize common preferences and reduce the number of explicit car choice assertions in {a mathematical formula}KB by selecting mid-sized cars with low fuel consumption as the default choice for the instances of {a mathematical formula}N(Y⊔M⊔E). We believe that a flexible logic should allow this approach. On the contrary, this is not permitted by or 2: two applications of this axiom force the instances of {a mathematical formula}N(Y⊔M⊔E) to belong to {a mathematical formula}NY⊔NM⊔NE, and hence to conform to some of the typical choices of {a mathematical formula}NY, {a mathematical formula}NM, and {a mathematical formula}NE (which exclude mid-sized cars). Note that the majority of people indeed prefer a sport car or a city car or a luxury car, but this disjunctive information may be of little use in attributing automatically a specific default choice to the generic instances of {a mathematical formula}N(Y⊔M⊔E), which explains the decision of our engineer. Choosing a mid-sized car by default, in this case, is an instance of the use of nonmonotonic reasoning as an opportunistic storage convention, aimed at reducing the size of the knowledge base, which is one of the possible uses of nonmonotonic reasoning envisioned by McCarthy [35].  □

       In typicality DLs, and 1 and or 2 are strong axioms, enforced by the underlying monotonic logic {a mathematical formula}ALC+T. It is easy to see (cf. Appendix B) that they are valid because the models of typicality logics adopt a single, concept-independent normality relation (e.g. if John is more typical than Mary as a student, it must also be more typical than Mary as an employee and as a working student). In {a mathematical formula}DLN, instead, each concept may be associated to an independent typicality criterion, which is the reason why and 1 and or 2 do not hold and the above two examples can be naturally encoded.

As we pointed out in Remark 1, this can be an interesting method for specializing {a mathematical formula}DLN and tuning the set of its valid axioms when needed, so as to obtain maximum flexibility.  □

       Normality criteria and internalized KLM postulates
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The inclusions {a mathematical formula}NC⊑D are analogues of the expressions {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure}D and {a mathematical formula}T(C)⊑D when they are used as queries.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Recall from Section 2.4 that the models {a mathematical formula}I of typicality logics are based on a universal, concept-independent notion of normality {a mathematical formula}≤I, and that {a mathematical formula}T(C)I is the set of {a mathematical formula}≤I-minimal members of {a mathematical formula}CI. It follows easily from this definition that the monotonic fragment of typicality DLs satisfies the following inference rule{sup:14}:{a mathematical formula} This rule clearly implies that CTT and CMT are sound. Since it may seem unrealistic to assume that the criterion for deciding what is a normal person is the same criterion that establishes – say – what is a normal hacker, in {a mathematical formula}DLN each concept may have its own notion of what is more normal or standard. In technical terms, this implies that the counterpart of (50) does not hold, that is, {a mathematical formula}NC⊑D does not entail {a mathematical formula}NC≡N(C⊓D) (just as if C and {a mathematical formula}C⊓D were associated to different typicality orderings). Consequently, {a mathematical formula}DLN does not satisfy the analogues of CTT and CMT either, that is, rules CT and CM in Table 4.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 8">
       Let {a mathematical formula}KB be:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The instances of {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D) satisfy the defeasible inclusions (54), (55), and (53), that is,{a mathematical formula} On the contrary, the lower-priority DI (51) is overridden, because the role restrictions of (54) and (55) imply that some instance x of {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D) satisfies ¬E, hence{a mathematical formula} The instances of {a mathematical formula}NC, instead, can consistently satisfy all the DIs in {a mathematical formula}KB, using the above x as a value of role R; it suffices to assume that x is not an instance of {a mathematical formula}NC. As explained above, there is no compelling reason for making x an instance of {a mathematical formula}NC, if we do not postulate that there exists a single, concept-independent normality criterion that forces {a mathematical formula}NC to be equal to {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D). Consequently, the following entailments hold:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Note that (56), (57) and (58) show that CM is not satisfied in this example. There are two possible ways of satisfying CM here, that is, overriding (51) in {a mathematical formula}NC (to remove (58)) or inferring {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D)⊑E. The former solution overrides a larger set of defeasible inclusions, in contrast with the principle that as many defaults as consistently possible should hold. Incidentally, this principle is embraced not only by Reiter's default logic, but also by Lehmann's approach to default reasoning based on the KLM postulates, cf. the presumptive reading of defaults and in particular Example 6 in [30], as well as Sec. 8 in the same paper. However, Lehmann's framework is propositional, so the above conflict between maximal default application and CM could not be observed. The second solution makes {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D) inconsistent although there is no unresolved conflict in {a mathematical formula}KB. This solution would contrast with the principle that specificity settles conflicting defaults, since the inconsistency of {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D) can only be supported with (51), which is the least specific default in this example and should consequently be overridden by the other DIs, as it happens in {a mathematical formula}DLN.A slight extension of the same example disproves CT. Extend {a mathematical formula}KB with two more axioms:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Now, since axiom (51) is overridden in {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D), then (60) can be inherited and hence {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D)⊑¬E. On the contrary, (60) is overridden by (51) in {a mathematical formula}NC, so {a mathematical formula}NC⋢¬E. This shows that CT does not hold. The above discussion on the consequences of CM in this example applies to CT as well.The only other logics where a similar example can be modeled are typicality DLs, that can denote typical instances; this makes it possible to encode axiom (55). Typicality DLs satisfy CTT and CMT by overriding the analogue of (51). As we pointed out before, this is obtained through the assumption that the normality criterion is concept independent, which forces {a mathematical formula}NC to collapse to {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D). Given the debatable consequences of this assumption (cf. the drawbacks of and 1 and or 2), an interesting open question is whether weaker assumptions suffice to enforce internalized CT and CM.  □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The next result shows that the occurrence of N in (55) is the only responsible for the falsification of CT and the dilemma of choosing between its unconditional application and the principle that a default should be applied unless higher priority or strong axioms state otherwise. More precisely, the next theorem proves that if {a mathematical formula}KB is N-free (i.e. normality concepts are allowed only in queries), then the maximal default application principle itself spontaneously enforces CT, as well as two other postulates.{sup:15}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 4">
       If{a mathematical formula}KBis N-free, then CT, OR, and RMare sound.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       An interesting observation is that the occurrences of N in {a mathematical formula}KB are essential to assert that certain roles have normal values. So N-free {a mathematical formula}DLN has the same expressiveness limitation as the DLs based on rational closure illustrated in Sec. 2.4, namely, defeasible axioms do not apply to role values. Given that removing this restriction in {a mathematical formula}DLN affects some of the internalized postulates, an interesting open question is whether removing the same limitation from [20], [21], [22], [19], [16] may similarly interfere with the internalized postulates.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Differently from the above postulates, the soundness of CM is affected not only by the explicit occurrences of N, but also by the novel requirement that unresolved conflicts yield inconsistent prototypes.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 9">
       Consider the simple N-free {a mathematical formula}KB consisting of:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Here the defeasible inclusions (62) and (63) together contradict the strong inclusion (61), but they have the same priority and hence the conflict cannot be resolved in C, therefore its prototype is inconsistent ({a mathematical formula}NC⊑⊥). On the contrary, the instances of {a mathematical formula}C⊓D, by definition, satisfy D (be they normal or not), so (63) is overridden and does not belong to the prototype of {a mathematical formula}C⊓D, which is consistent. This shows that CM does not hold. If it were applied, then {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D) would be made inconsistent, too, which is difficult to justify: it is not clear why the strong facts {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D)⊑D and (61) should not override (63) in the prototype of {a mathematical formula}C⊓D.  □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       There are no further reasons why CM is not valid, as shown by the following theorem:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 5">
       If{a mathematical formula}KBis N-free and{a mathematical formula}NCis satisfiable w.r.t.{a mathematical formula}KB, then CMis sound.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We leave two general questions open, namely, whether an overriding criterion that does not silently remove unresolved conflicts can be harmonized with the internalized version of CM, and whether this postulate should be restricted to consistent prototypes only. The typicality logic {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin would deal with the above example by making C inconsistent, that is, the conflict between {a mathematical formula}T(C)⊑D and {a mathematical formula}T(C)⊑E (the analogues of (62) and (63)) is propagated from the prototype of C to all of C. In other words, if there can be no prototypical instances, there can be no atypical instances, either, while one would probably expect a clash between defeasible inclusions to affect typical instances only.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We are left to discuss REF, LLE, and RW. Rule REF is nothing but axiom (49), so it clearly holds without restrictions. Similarly, RW is unconditionally sound: it is a classical inference, and {a mathematical formula}DLN is closed under classical reasoning. On the contrary, LLE is not sound, in general, although it should. In the “weak” semantics of {a mathematical formula}DLN – where distinct normality concepts are treated like different concept names – {a mathematical formula}NC and {a mathematical formula}ND can be made artificially different (e.g. with axioms like {a mathematical formula}⊤⊑n∃R.(NC⊓¬ND)). In the N-free fragment (where such axioms cannot be asserted) we have slightly better properties:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Theorem 6">
       If{a mathematical formula}KBis N-free, then LLEis sound.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Still, {a mathematical formula}C≡D does not imply {a mathematical formula}NC≡ND (LLE states only that {a mathematical formula}NC and {a mathematical formula}ND have the same logical properties), although this would be a reasonable inference to have, in order to enforce the natural principle that equivalents can be substituted for equivalents. In the next section, {a mathematical formula}DLN's semantics is refined in order to satisfy the above equivalence and make LLE valid.

     A refined semantics for {a mathematical formula}DLN
     <paragraph>
      Hereafter, {a mathematical formula}DL refers to any classical description logic that corresponds to a fragment of First Order Logic, such as {a mathematical formula}SROIQ (the logic underlying OWL2).{sup:16}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The new semantics is centred around a set of bounded interpretations that constitute a sort of Kripke structure, used to define overriding and constrain the semantics of normality concepts. We will see that, by the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, this set of interpretations is representative of all interpretations.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Let Δ be an arbitrary but fixed infinite domain. A Δ-interpretation{a mathematical formula}I=〈ΔI,⋅I〉 is any extension of a (classical) interpretation of {a mathematical formula}DL such that {a mathematical formula}ΔI⊆Δ and {a mathematical formula}NCI⊆CI, for all concepts C in {a mathematical formula}DL. Given {a mathematical formula}KB=S∪D, we say that {a mathematical formula}I is a {a mathematical formula}(S,Δ)-premodel iff (i) {a mathematical formula}I is a classical model of {a mathematical formula}S ({a mathematical formula}I⊨S), and (ii) {a mathematical formula}NCI=NDI if {a mathematical formula}CJ=DJ holds for all Δ-interpretation {a mathematical formula}J satisfying {a mathematical formula}S. Premodels satisfy {a mathematical formula}S and (49), as in the old semantics [5]; additionally, they make {a mathematical formula}NC and {a mathematical formula}ND equivalent whenever C and D are intensionally equivalent within the set of classical models of {a mathematical formula}S bounded by Δ.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Recall that the set of normality concepts that satisfy a DI δ in a Δ-interpretation {a mathematical formula}I is:{a mathematical formula} As in [5], δ is overridden in{a mathematical formula}NCin the context of{a mathematical formula}I (for short, δ is overridden in {a mathematical formula}NC/I) if δ makes the prototype of C necessarily inconsistent with the higher-priority axioms that are satisfied and not overridden in the context of {a mathematical formula}I (the definition of overriding is recursive). The novelty is that by “necessarily”, we mean that δ is inconsistent with those axioms in the set of all {a mathematical formula}(S,Δ)-premodels.{sup:17} The set of {a mathematical formula}NC such that δ is overridden in {a mathematical formula}NC/I, denoted by {a mathematical formula}ovdKB(δ,I), is thus defined as follows:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 1">
      Overriding, {a mathematical formula}ovdLet{a mathematical formula}KB=S∪Dand{a mathematical formula}Ibe a Δ-interpretation.

      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      The subscript {a mathematical formula}KB of {a mathematical formula}ovd will be dropped whenever clear from context.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Now we are ready to define the semantics of {a mathematical formula}DLN. A Δ-interpretation {a mathematical formula}Isatisfies an axiom ϵ in the context Δ, in symbols {a mathematical formula}I{an inline-figure}Δϵ, if and only if:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="1.">
       ϵ is a concept inclusion, a role inclusion, or an assertion, and {a mathematical formula}I⊨ϵ ;
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="2.">
       ϵ is a DI and, for all normality concept NC, {a mathematical formula}NC∈sat(ϵ,I)∪ovd(ϵ,I) (that is, ϵ is satisfied by all normality concepts where it is not overridden).
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      Then a {a mathematical formula}(S,Δ)-premodel {a mathematical formula}Iis a Δ-model of{a mathematical formula}KB=S∪D, in symbols {a mathematical formula}I{an inline-figure}ΔKB, iff, for all {a mathematical formula}δ∈D, {a mathematical formula}I{an inline-figure}Δδ.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Finally, the notion of semantic consequence is defined as usual: an axiom ϵ is a Δ-consequence of {a mathematical formula}KB, written {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}Δϵ, iff for all Δ-models {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}KB, {a mathematical formula}I{an inline-figure}Δϵ.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The relativization to Δ of the new semantics prevents any form of unrestricted comprehension[27] in Definition 1 and in the definition of premodel. Relativization introduces no ambiguity, as proved in the following theorem.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Theorem 7">
      Let{a mathematical formula}Δ1and{a mathematical formula}Δ2be two infinite sets. Then,{a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}Δ1ϵiff{a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}Δ2ϵ.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Accordingly, we shall drop the subscript Δ from now on. The translation of {a mathematical formula}DLN knowledge bases in classical {a mathematical formula}DL needs one simple change: equation (4) should be replaced with{a mathematical formula} The new translation is correct, as stated by the following theorem. The expression {a mathematical formula}DLΣ denotes the extension of {a mathematical formula}DL with the normality concepts in Σ.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Theorem 8">
      Let{a mathematical formula}KBbe a general{a mathematical formula}DLNknowledge base, and let Σ be any finite set of normality concepts containing at least all the{a mathematical formula}NCthat occur in{a mathematical formula}KB. Let{a mathematical formula}KBΣdenote the new translation of{a mathematical formula}KBwhere(4)is replaced by(64). For all subsumptions and assertions{a mathematical formula}α∈DLΣ,{a mathematical formula}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      With this translation, all the complexity results of [5], all the results introduced in the previous sections, and all the examples and counterexamples illustrated so far can be immediately extended to the refined semantics.{sup:18} Moreover, the additional property of premodels makes LLE sound even if some normality concepts occur in the DIs, because {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}C≡D makes {a mathematical formula}NC≡ND true in all premodels.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Theorem 9">
      For all canonical knowledge bases{a mathematical formula}KB, LLEis sound.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Therefore, under the refined semantics, the restriction of {a mathematical formula}DLN to N-free knowledge bases is almost rational with respect to the postulates in Table 4; the only difference is that CM applies only to consistent normality concepts, as discussed in the previous section. In general, CT, CM, OR, and RM are not valid, because {a mathematical formula}DLN does not adopt a unique, concept-independent normality citerion, cf. Example 8 and Appendix C. The other postulates are unconditionally valid.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The examples illustrated in sections 2–5 are not affected by the change of semantics, because they involve no pair of equivalent normality concepts. The following example shows a case where the difference is visible, instead, and inferring the equivalence of two normality concepts plays an important role.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Example 10">
      Let {a mathematical formula}KB be the knowledge base consisting of:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The old semantics can infer both {a mathematical formula}N(A⊓B)⊑C and {a mathematical formula}N(B⊓A)⊑C. However, it entails neither {a mathematical formula}N(A⊓B)≡N(B⊓A) nor {a mathematical formula}ND⊑∃R.N(B⊓A), although it does entail the similar inclusion {a mathematical formula}ND⊑∃R.N(A⊓B). On the contrary, both sentences are correctly entailed by the new semantics.  □

      Further related work
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Nonmonotonic DLs have been obtained from virtually all nonmonotonic semantics [17], [3], [4], [23], [33], [9], [24], [25], [20], [22]. They have been extensively compared to {a mathematical formula}DLN in terms of: conflict resolution and priority criteria; immunity to inheritance blocking and closed-world effects; computational complexity. The results are summarized in [5, Table 1], and show that {a mathematical formula}DLN actually addresses successfully a number of issues related to knowledge engineering needs.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Propositional Default logic, Autoepistemic logic, and Circumscription have been given a proof-theoretic characterization by means of sequent calculi [10]. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has never been extended to DLs. Tableaux methods for some nonmonotonic DLs can be found, for example, in [26], [24].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Circumscribed DLs [9] are simply a syntactic variant of the traditional circumscription of first-order knowledge bases; so, using standard techniques similar to those introduced in [29], one can see that their consequence relation is preferential, in the metalevel sense captured by Table 1. Similarly, well-established arguments, similar to those used in [34], can be used to prove that Default DLs and Autoepistemic DLs [3], [4], [23] are not cumulative because their sceptical and credulous entailment relations do not satisfy CM, and their credulous entailment does not satisfy CT, either. On the other hand, Default and Autoepistemic DLs extend classical inference, so they satisfy REF, LLE, and RW. These observation and the results of Section 3 provide a direct comparison of the consequence relations of these DLs and {a mathematical formula}DLN.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The studies of the DLs based on rational closure, lexicographic closure, and typicality, such as [33], [24], [25], [20], [22], are centred around internalized versions of the KLM postulates, instead. Differently from {a mathematical formula}DLN, those logics use the same constructs for asserting default properties and for expressing their consequences, so there is only one internalized version of the postulates. Relative to the internalized postulates, the typicality logic {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin is preferential, while the other logics cited above are rational; the probabilistic logic based on lexicographic entailment, however, satisfies OR relative to a nonstandard disjunction operator, cf. [33, Theorem 4.19].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Unfortunately, in these logics, the metalevel postulates have never been considered, which reduces the opportunities for comparing their consequence relations with {an inline-figure}. Even if the aforementioned logics satisfy most or all of the internalized postulates, this does not mean that the metalevel postulates are satisfied, as shown below, although apparently the arguments provided by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor in support of some metalevel postulates should apply verbatim.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In the DLs based on rational and lexicographic closures, every classical (strong) assertion {a mathematical formula}C⊑D about the world can be encoded as a defeasible inclusion {a mathematical formula}C⊓¬D{an inline-figure}⊥. In this form, the inclusion cannot be possibly overridden by any other axiom, due to the definition of rank, so it actually behaves as certain, non-defeasible information. As a special case, using classical equivalences, every strong axiom {a mathematical formula}B⊑⊥ can be equivalently expressed as {a mathematical formula}B{an inline-figure}⊥.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Now, Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor argue that given some defeasible background knowledge {a mathematical formula}KB and two strong sentences α and β, if both {a mathematical formula}KB∪{α} and {a mathematical formula}KB∪{β} entail a strong sentence γ, then also {a mathematical formula}KB∪{α∨γ} should entail γ (OR rule): It is a valid principle of monotonic classical reasoning and does not imply monotonicity, therefore we tend to accept it [...] If we think that “if John attends the party then, normally, the evening will be great” and also that “if Cathy attends the party then, normally, the evening will be great” and hear that at least one of Cathy or John will attend the party, shouldn't we be tempted to join in[29]? Concerning the first sentence of this argument, we remark en passant that we do not see any compelling reasons for considering the maximization of the classical inferences that do not yield monotonicity a more important goal than addressing knowledge engineering needs. Still, whoever embraces the above motivations should be ready to accept the following argument. Let {a mathematical formula}KB be{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Moreover, let α and β, respectively, be {a mathematical formula}B1{an inline-figure}⊥ and {a mathematical formula}B2{an inline-figure}⊥, that are equivalent to the strong inclusions {a mathematical formula}B1⊑⊥ and {a mathematical formula}B2⊑⊥. It is not hard to see that, according to the rational closure defined in [20], both {a mathematical formula}KB∪{α} and {a mathematical formula}KB∪{β} entail {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure}⊥, that is equivalent to the strong inclusion {a mathematical formula}C⊑⊥. Therefore, the argument in support of the OR rule says that {a mathematical formula}KB∪{α∨β} should entail that C is empty, as well. Note that {a mathematical formula}α∨β can be equivalently expressed using the universal role U as {a mathematical formula}∃U.B1⊓∃U.B2{an inline-figure}⊥.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      However, rational closure yields a different result. The axiom {a mathematical formula}α∨β is too weak to entail the emptyness of any of {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}A2, consequently C is given a higher rank than {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}A2, and due to inheritance blocking, {a mathematical formula}KB∪{α∨β} does not entail that C is empty, thereby violating the metalevel OR rule.{sup:19}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Additionally, some typicality DLs do not satisfy the original, metalevel version of RM; a counterexample can be found in Appendix F. Unfortunately, there is no complete picture of which metalevel postulates are satisfied, although the similarities between {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin and circumscription make us conjecture that its consequence relation is preferential in the metalevel sense. Then, the internalized and metalevel properties of {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin would perfectly match.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      A few critical analyses of the KLM postulates and related properties can be found in the literature on typicality logics. In [24, Sec. 7.2], internalized RM is shown to be too strong in the context of the typicality logics extending {a mathematical formula}ALC+T. In [12], it is proved that several postulates related to rational consequence relations and their representability in terms of ranked models cannot be simultaneously satisfied in the context of Booth's propositional typicality logic.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Recall that the DLs based on rational and lexicographic closures do not apply defeasible axioms to role values. This is probably due to the fact that the rational closure defined for the propositional framework is applied to conditionals {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure}D as if C and D were propositional formulae. However, in first-order syntax, the intended meaning of such expressions corresponds in fact to a sort of open conditional like {a mathematical formula}C(x){an inline-figure}D(x). Such conditionals have been considered by Lehmann and Magidor in a short TARK'90 paper [31]. They felt the need for additional postulates for introducing and eliminating ∃. This predicate version of the KLM theory has not been fully developed. Resuming this line of work might be a key to overcoming the aforementioned limitation of the DLs based on rational and lexicographic closures.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Finally, we mention a preferential DL [15] that similarly to [25] adopts the syntax based on defeasible inclusions, like the rational closure of DLs, but the semantics is based on ranked interpretations like those of typicality logics. The emphasis is on inductive and abductive reasoning, which are captured by two dual defeasible inclusion operators, one of which is monotonic. The other operator is nonmonotonic and satisfies all the internalized postulates.

      Conclusions
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      The semantics of N is almost completely determined by the application of defeasible inclusions and overriding. The underlying monotonic logic forces only the elementary inclusions {a mathematical formula}NC⊑C. In this respect, {a mathematical formula}DLN is more similar to rational closure than typicality logics, as the latter's monotonic fragment gives the typicality operator several nontrivial properties, such as (50) and the analogues of and 1 and or 2. Note that (50) alone suffices to enforce CMT and CTT.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The application of defeasible inclusions and the overriding criterion of {a mathematical formula}DLN (with its new conflict handling approach) make {an inline-figure} a cumulative consequence relation. The remaining rules, OR and RM, are sound under the additional assumption that consistent concepts have at least one normal instance. Interestingly, in typicality logics, the existence of normal individuals is forced by the monotonic layer of the semantics, through the smoothness property of the normality relation. Similarly, we plan to investigate variants of {a mathematical formula}DLN where the existence assumption is cast into the monotonic part of the semantics. This should be done with some care, though: if too many individuals were forced to be normal, then the undesirable closed-world assumption effects described in [5], that affect typicality logics, might be introduced in {a mathematical formula}DLN.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The above results provide an immediate comparison with the consequence relations of Circumscribed DLs (that are preferential) and those of Default and Autoepistemic DLs (that are not cumulative). Unfortunately, not much is known about the metalevel postulates satisfied by the DLs based on typicality, rational closure, and lexicographic closure (although the arguments put forward by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor to support some of their postulates are general enough to apply in these contexts as well). As of today, we only know that some typicality DLs and the rational closure of {a mathematical formula}ALC extended with the universal role U violate RM and OR, respectively (cf. Section 7 and Appendix F), but this is not enough for an extended comparison at this level.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Next we studied the logical properties of N. With the goals of {a mathematical formula}DLN in mind, we argued that the boolean operators should not be unconditionally forced to commute with N and that only the inclusion {a mathematical formula}N¬C⊑¬NC should always hold. Concerning the internalized version of the KLM postulates listed in Table 4, the refined semantics of {a mathematical formula}DLN unconditionally satisfies REF, LLE, and RW. Example 8, Example 9, and Appendix C show that, in general, the other postulates of Table 4 conflict with either the principle that as many defaults as consistently possible should be applied, or with the principle that conflicts should be resolved in favor of higher priority axioms (with strong inclusions as top priority axioms). Example 8 explains also that this clash between principles arises because {a mathematical formula}DLN relativizes the notion of typicality, that is, it does not assume that such notion is unique and concept-independent. Moreover, as shown in Example 9, CM interferes with the novel conflict handling approach of {a mathematical formula}DLN. In particular, if {a mathematical formula}NC is inconsistent, then CM forces all concepts {a mathematical formula}N(C⊓D) to be inconsistent, too, thereby preventing any resolution of the conflicts in C's prototype, no matter which piece of strong information D is added to C (cf. Example 9). This observation raises two interesting questions: Should internalized cautious monotonicity hold universally in a logic where unresolved conflicts yield inconsistent prototypes? What is the right way of harmonizing the KLM postulates with the emerging knowledge engineering needs? These issues could not be observed nor discussed in the original KLM framework, because it adopted the traditional, silent conflict removal approach.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Typicality DLs preserve both the default application principle underlying default logic and the analogue of Table 4 (with the possible exception of RM) by means of strong axioms, based on the assumption that the notion of typicality is concept-independent (cf. Section 5 and Appendix B). This assumption has some debatable consequences (cf. Example 6) and the authors of [25] plan to investigate logics with multiple, relativized typicality relations. However, as argued in Appendix B, the internalized postulates are so closely related to the concept-independence assumption that this objective is likely to be challenging. The issues related to the novel conflict resolution approach, instead, are not visible in typicality logics, because in general the conflicts arising from multiple inheritance are silently removed.{sup:20}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The DLs based on rational closure recalled in Section 2.4 satisfy the analogue of Table 4 where each inclusion {a mathematical formula}NC⊑D corresponds to a conditional {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure}D. In this case, the cost to be payed is the inability of applying defeasible axioms to role values (so our counterexamples cannot be modeled). Of course, {a mathematical formula}DLN could be restricted in a similar way by allowing only N-free knowledge bases. It is interesting to note that, with this restriction, the internalized postulates satisfied by the two frameworks become almost identical. Using the refined semantics introduced in Sec. 6, the internalized versions of the KLM axioms illustrated in Table 4 are all satisfied with the partial exception of CM, that is guaranteed to apply only to consistent concepts {a mathematical formula}NC. As discussed above, we leave it as an open question whether CM should be applied also to the inconsistent normality concepts produced by the novel conflict handling approach of {a mathematical formula}DLN.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We have also reported a second internalized version of the KLM axioms, centred around defeasible inclusions (cf. Table 2), that has been technically studied in [5]. We enriched the illustration of these rules by highlighting their relationships with Lehmann's redefinition of default reasoning. Using the notation of [30], a DI {a mathematical formula}C⊑nD corresponds to a default {a mathematical formula}(C:D). Since defeasible inclusions have the same role as Reiter's defaults as well as Lehmann's, they have similar behavior: for all concepts {a mathematical formula}NE, a DI {a mathematical formula}C⊑nD is either overridden in {a mathematical formula}NE (and hence irrelevant) or it is applied; in the latter case, it yields the same effects as the corresponding classical inclusion {a mathematical formula}NE⊓C⊑D. Accordingly, all the rules of Table 2 hold when their premises are not overridden, analogously to Lehmann's approach.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Summarizing the comparison of the above logics, the metalevel KLM postulates are still partly unexplored, while their internalized versions are currently satisfied at a cost. In {a mathematical formula}DLN – whose goals are not completely aligned with those of the KLM framework – the dilemma is solved in favor of other desiderata, namely, full expressiveness (i.e. supporting role restriction to normal instances), relativized typicality, and tight correspondence between inconsistent prototypes and unresolved conflicts. It is not yet clear to what extent the various incarnations of the KLM postulates can be harmonized with the above desiderata, nor what the ideal tradeoff should be, for each of the possible applications of nonmonotonic reasoning listed in [35]. The answer to these questions probably lies in the study of first-order versions of the KLM theory supporting the novel conflict handling approach.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Should the KLM postulates turn out to be inherently incompatible with some of the other requirements, Remark 1, Remark 2 suggest an interesting direction for further research, namely, designing a flexible logic whose inferences can be tuned to application needs by including suitable axioms in the knowledge base.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Finally, note that the postulates studied here do not directly relate {a mathematical formula}⊑n and N. Currently, the mutual relations between DIs and their effects on normality concepts can be partially and indirectly evinced from the results applying to Table 2, Table 4. A complete account requires studying hybrid versions of the postulates, e.g. those obtained by taking the premises from Table 2 and the consequents from Table 4. This investigation, that is needed to complete the analysis of {a mathematical formula}DLN, will be the subject of future work.

     Details for Section 5.1
     <paragraph>
      Here we briefly provide some details about the tight relationships between the logical properties of T in typicality DLs and the assumption that the typicality relations {a mathematical formula}≤I are concept-independent.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We first recall how and 1 is satisfied thanks to this assumption. Recall that for all interpretations {a mathematical formula}I, and for all concepts C, {a mathematical formula}T(C)I is the set of {a mathematical formula}≤I-minimal members of {a mathematical formula}CI, where {a mathematical formula}≤I is the unique typicality relation associated to {a mathematical formula}I. Assume that x is an instance of {a mathematical formula}(T(C)⊓T(D))I. We must prove that, in accordance with axiom and 1, x is also an instance of {a mathematical formula}(T(C⊓D))I. Suppose not; we shall derive a contradiction. Clearly, {a mathematical formula}x∈(C⊓D)I, by assumption, so it must be the case that x is not a {a mathematical formula}≤I-minimal such member. Then there exists {a mathematical formula}y&lt;Ix such that {a mathematical formula}y∈(C⊓D)I. However, since this implies that {a mathematical formula}y∈CI and {a mathematical formula}y&lt;Ix, it follows that x cannot be an instance of {a mathematical formula}T(C)I (which contradicts our initial assumption). Clearly, it is crucial for this argument that the same typicality relation be used to define {a mathematical formula}T(C)I and {a mathematical formula}T(C⊓D)I.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The second step consists in verifying that without the concept-independence assumption and 1 would not hold, indeed. For this purpose, assume that {a mathematical formula}T(C), {a mathematical formula}T(D), and {a mathematical formula}T(C⊓D) are defined with three different relations, that we denote with {a mathematical formula}≤CI, {a mathematical formula}≤DI, and {a mathematical formula}≤C⊓DI, respectively. We construct a counterexample {a mathematical formula}I where {a mathematical formula}ΔI={a,b}, {a mathematical formula}a≤CIb, {a mathematical formula}a≤DIb, and {a mathematical formula}b≤C⊓DIa. It can be immediately verified that {a mathematical formula}(T(C)⊓T(D))I={a} while {a mathematical formula}(T(C⊓D))I={b}, so and 1 is not satisfied. Note that all the orderings are both modular and smooth, so this counterexample is compatible with all the standard properties of the preferential and rational models of typicality.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      With similar arguments, one can see that both or 2 and (50) strictly depend on the concept-independence assumption; the details are straightforward, and left to the reader. Moreover, if (50) does not hold, then the same happens to CMT and CTT; it can be shown with a direct analogue of Example 8. It follows that if one is determined to satisfy the six postulates REFT–RMT without the drawbacks of the concept-independence assumption, then this assumption cannot be simply dropped; it must be carefully weakened.

     Counterexamples for Section 5.2

     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Note that Example 8 applies to RM, too. Rule RM has the same puzzling consequences as CM and CT that have been discussed in the example. The counterexample to unrestricted OR is based on similar ideas. {a mathematical formula}KB is:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The top-priority DIs (84)–(85) and (87)–(88) apply to {a mathematical formula}N(C⊔D), and produce the following consequences:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} These two inclusions (supported by strong axioms and top-priority DIs) are inconsistent with {a mathematical formula}N(C⊔D)⊑E and hence override (89) in {a mathematical formula}N(C⊔D).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      This does not happen with {a mathematical formula}NC and {a mathematical formula}ND. They can consistently satisfy all the DIs of {a mathematical formula}KB′, therefore (89) entails the following inclusions:{a mathematical formula} Consequently, OR would infer {a mathematical formula}N(C⊔D)⊑E, making {a mathematical formula}N(C⊔D) unnecessarily inconsistent. Alternative solutions are: unnecessarily overriding either the top-priority axioms in {a mathematical formula}N(C⊔D), or the DI (89) in {a mathematical formula}NC and/or {a mathematical formula}ND.

      The proofs for Section 5 use an interesting lemma that needs the following notation:{a mathematical formula} Informally speaking, {a mathematical formula}NC∼ND means that C and D have the same prototype in {a mathematical formula}KB. Furthermore,{a mathematical formula} denotes the result of substituting D for C in {a mathematical formula}S.

As before, by the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, there exists a {a mathematical formula}(S,Δ1)-premodel such that {a mathematical formula}sat(δ,J1)=sat(δ,J2) and {a mathematical formula}J1⊨NC⊑⊥ iff {a mathematical formula}J2⊨NC⊑⊥. Since {a mathematical formula}sat(δ′,I1)=sat(δ′,I2) and by induction hypothesis {a mathematical formula}ovdKB(δ′,I1)=ovdKB(δ′,I2), it follows that {a mathematical formula}J2 satisfies one of (i), (ii), or (iii) too. Subsequently, {a mathematical formula}NC∈ovd(δ,I2). The converse can be proved analogously.Claim 2: {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}Δ1ϵ iff {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}Δ2ϵ. Assume that {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}Δ1ϵ and let {a mathematical formula}I2 be a model {a mathematical formula}KB in {a mathematical formula}Δ2. By Claim 1, there exists a {a mathematical formula}(S,Δ1)-premodel {a mathematical formula}I1 that satisfies the same classical axiom and defeasible inclusions as {a mathematical formula}I2. Consequently, the following chain of facts hold: {a mathematical formula}I1 is model of {a mathematical formula}KB (by Claim 1); {a mathematical formula}I1{an inline-figure}ϵ (by the assumption {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}Δ1ϵ); {a mathematical formula}I2{an inline-figure}ϵ (again, by Claim 1). Hence, {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}Δ2ϵ. The converse can be proved analogously.  □

      Similar to the proof of Theorem 1 in [5]. We just report the points where substantial changes are required.Claim 2 of Lemma 24: If{a mathematical formula}δiND∈KBΣand{a mathematical formula}ND∈ovd(δi,I), then there exist{a mathematical formula}j&lt;iand{a mathematical formula}NE∈Σsuch that{a mathematical formula}δj∈KB,{a mathematical formula}δjNE∉KBΣ, and{a mathematical formula}NE∉ovd(δj,I).Assume the hypotheses of Claim 2 hold. The first one ({a mathematical formula}δiND∈KBΣ) implies (by definition of the sequence {a mathematical formula}〈SiΣ〉i) that {a mathematical formula}Si−1Σ↓≺δi∪{δiND}⊭ND⊑⊥, therefore, there exists {a mathematical formula}J0 satisfying {a mathematical formula}Si−1Σ↓≺δi and {a mathematical formula}δiND, such that {a mathematical formula}NDJ0≠∅. Let {a mathematical formula}J be an extension of {a mathematical formula}J0 such that, for all normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NH∉Σ, we have that{a mathematical formula}By construction, {a mathematical formula}J agrees with {a mathematical formula}J0 on the interpretation of all {a mathematical formula}DLΣ sentences. Since {a mathematical formula}J0 satisfies {a mathematical formula}S0Σ, this means that {a mathematical formula}J satisfies {a mathematical formula}S, {a mathematical formula}NH⊑H (for all {a mathematical formula}NH∈Σ), and {a mathematical formula}NH≡NH′ (for all {a mathematical formula}NH,NH′∈Σ such that {a mathematical formula}S⊨H≡H′).Concerning the normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NH∉Σ, we distinguish two cases. In the first case there exists {a mathematical formula}NF∈Σ such that {a mathematical formula}S⊨F≡H. By construction {a mathematical formula}NHJ=NFJ and, as seen above, {a mathematical formula}J satisfies {a mathematical formula}NF⊑F. Therefore, being {a mathematical formula}J a model of {a mathematical formula}S, we have that {a mathematical formula}J satisfies {a mathematical formula}NH⊑H as well. Moreover, for each G such that {a mathematical formula}S⊨G≡H, by transitivity {a mathematical formula}S⊨G≡F, consequently {a mathematical formula}NHJ=NGJ. In the second case {a mathematical formula}S⊭F≡H, for each {a mathematical formula}NF∈Σ. By construction, {a mathematical formula}NHJ=∅ and hence {a mathematical formula}J trivially satisfies {a mathematical formula}NH⊑H. Moreover, if {a mathematical formula}S⊨F≡H, by hypothesis {a mathematical formula}NFJ is empty as well – otherwise {a mathematical formula}NH would come under the previous case. Hence, {a mathematical formula}J satisfies {a mathematical formula}NH≡NF.So, putting all this together, we have that {a mathematical formula}J is a premodel of {a mathematical formula}S. Moreover, by construction, {a mathematical formula}J satisfies conditions 1 and 2 of Definition 1.{sup:21} If {a mathematical formula}J satisfied also condition 3, then {a mathematical formula}ND∉ovd(δi,I), which contradicts the assumptions. Therefore {a mathematical formula}J violates condition 3; it follows that there must be some {a mathematical formula}δj∈KB{a mathematical formula}(j&lt;i) and some normality concept {a mathematical formula}NE such that {a mathematical formula}NE∈sat(δj,I)∖ovd(δj,I) but{a mathematical formula} This fact has two consequences. First, if {a mathematical formula}NE∉Σ, then {a mathematical formula}NEJ=NFJ, for some {a mathematical formula}NF∈Σ, otherwise {a mathematical formula}NE would vacuously satisfy {a mathematical formula}δj, contradicting (102). Therefore, we can assume w.l.o.g. that {a mathematical formula}NE∈Σ. Second, since {a mathematical formula}J and {a mathematical formula}J0 agree on {a mathematical formula}DLΣ by construction, (102) implies {a mathematical formula}J0⊭δjNE which is possible only if {a mathematical formula}δjNE∉KBΣ. Finally, {a mathematical formula}NE∉ovd(δj,I) holds because {a mathematical formula}NE∈sat(δj,I)∖ovd(δj,I).Lemma 25: Let{a mathematical formula}Ibe a{a mathematical formula}DLNmodel of{a mathematical formula}KB. For all normality concepts{a mathematical formula}NC∈Σ, and for all{a mathematical formula}δi∈KB,{a mathematical formula}NC∈ovd(δi,I)iff{a mathematical formula}The if direction does not need to be changed whereas the only if direction only requires to define the extension {a mathematical formula}J of {a mathematical formula}J0 as previously done in Claim 2 of Lemma 24. As proved above, {a mathematical formula}J is a premodel of {a mathematical formula}S and the proof then continues as it was.  □

      Typicality logic and metalevel RM
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      In this appendix we illustrate a counterexample to the metalevel version of RM in the typicality logic {a mathematical formula}ALC+{a mathematical formula}Tmin.{sup:22} This logic minimizes the sets of atypical instances in the models of the monotonic typicality logic {a mathematical formula}ALC+T. Let {a mathematical formula}KB be the following knowledge base:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} By (108) every model of {a mathematical formula}KB in {a mathematical formula}ALC+{a mathematical formula}Tmin contains one atypical individual x that belongs either to {a mathematical formula}B1⊓¬A⊓¬B2 or to {a mathematical formula}B2⊓A⊓¬B1.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Due to the latter case, it follows that this {a mathematical formula}KB does not entail {a mathematical formula}¬(⊤⊑∀R.A). However, it implies {a mathematical formula}A⊓B1⊓C⊑⊥. These are the effects of the minimization of atypical instances.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Now, RM says that {a mathematical formula}KB∪{⊤⊑∀R.A} should still entail {a mathematical formula}A⊓B1⊓C⊑⊥. However, this is not the case. In the models of the extended knowledge base, x belongs either to {a mathematical formula}B1⊓A⊓¬B2 or to {a mathematical formula}B2⊓A⊓¬B1. The former case does not correspond to any model of the original {a mathematical formula}KB, and invalidates the conclusion {a mathematical formula}A⊓B1⊓C⊑⊥.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      This example applies also to the nonmonotonic DL obtained by applying to the models of {a mathematical formula}ALC+TR (that satisfy the internalized version of RM) the minimization of atypical instances adopted by {a mathematical formula}ALC+{a mathematical formula}Tmin.
