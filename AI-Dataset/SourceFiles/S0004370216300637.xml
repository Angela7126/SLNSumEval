We investigate how this requirement can be met by theories developed within the framework of circumscription, and specify a constraint – the exemption principle – that must be satisfied to do so. This principle determines in cases of conflicting default rules which objects are exempted from which rules, and, as such, is the main source for the capricious logical behavior of the sentences we are interested in. To facilitate comparison (and implementation) we supply an algorithm for inheritance networks and prove that arguments that can be expressed in both frameworks are valid on the circumscriptive account if and only if the inheritance algorithm has a positive outcome.</abstract><keywords>Circumscription;Defaults;Nonmonotonic logic;Inheritance networks</keywords><content><section label="1"><section-title>Introduction</section-title><paragraph>Discussions often end before the issues that started them have been resolved. In the 1980s and 1990s default reasoning was a hot topic in the field of logic and AI. The result of this discussion was not one single theory that met with general agreement, but a collection of alternative theories, each with its merits, but none entirely satisfactory. This paper aims to give a new impetus to this discussion.</paragraph><paragraph>The issue is the logical behavior of sentences of the form{a mathematical formula} Such sentences function as default rules. What they mean is roughly this: when you are confronted with an object with property S, and you have no evidence to the contrary, you are legitimized to assume that this object has property P.</paragraph><paragraph>The ‘evidence to the contrary’ can vary. Sometimes it simply consists in the empirical observation that the object concerned is in fact an exception to the rule. On other occasions the evidence may be more indirect. Consider:{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>This is a case of conflicting defaults.{sup:1} At first sight one might be tempted to draw both the conclusion that c is E (from premises 1 and 4) and that c is not E (from premises 2 and 4), and maybe on second thought to draw neither. But the third premise states that objects with the property S normally have the property A as well. So, apparently, normal S's are exceptional A's, as the rule that A's are normally E does not hold for them. In other words, only the S-defaults apply to c. So, presumably, c is not E.</paragraph><paragraph>Default reasoning has been formalized in various ways, and within each of the existing theoretical frameworks a number of strategies have been proposed to deal with conflicting defaults. In the following we will focus on two of these frameworks, Circumscription (McCarthy [1], [2]), and Inheritance Networks (Horty et al. [3]), and implement a new strategy to deal with conflicting rules in each of these.</paragraph></section><section label="2"><section-title>Naive circumscription</section-title><paragraph>Within the circumscriptive approach a sentence of the form S's are normally P is represented by a formula of the form{a mathematical formula} Here {a mathematical formula}AbSxPxx is a one place predicate. The subscript ‘{a mathematical formula}SxPx’ serves as an index, indicating the rule concerned. If an object a satisfies the formula {a mathematical formula}AbSxPxx, this means that a is an abnormal object with respect to this rule.</paragraph><paragraph>More generally, let {a mathematical formula}L0 be a language of monadic first order logic. With each pair {a mathematical formula}〈φ(x),ψ(x)〉,{sup:2} we associate a new one-place predicate {a mathematical formula}Abφ(x)ψ(x), thus obtaining the first order language {a mathematical formula}L.</paragraph><paragraph>A default rule is a formula of {a mathematical formula}L of the form{a mathematical formula} Here, {a mathematical formula}φ(x) and {a mathematical formula}ψ(x) must be formulas of {a mathematical formula}L0 that are quantifier-free and in which no individual constant occurs. The formula {a mathematical formula}φ(x) is called the antecedent of the rule, {a mathematical formula}Abφ(x)ψ(x)x is its abnormality clause, and {a mathematical formula}ψ(x) its consequent. Again, the index {a mathematical formula}φ(x)ψ(x) is there just to indicate that it concerns the abnormality predicate of the rule with antecedent {a mathematical formula}φ(x) and consequent {a mathematical formula}ψ(x). When it is clear which variable is at stake we will write {a mathematical formula}Abφψ rather than {a mathematical formula}Abφ(x)ψ(x). And often we will shorten ‘{a mathematical formula}∀x((φ(x)∧¬Abφψx)→ψ(x))’ further to{a mathematical formula} Since it is clear from the antecedent and the consequent of a default rule what the abnormality clause is, this should not cause confusion.{sup:3}</paragraph><paragraph>In ordinary logic, for an argument to be valid, the conclusion must be true in all models in which the premises are true. The basic idea underlying circumscription is that not all models of the premises matter but only the most normal ones – only the ones in which the extension of the abnormality predicates is inclusion-wise minimal given the information at hand. Formally:</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 2.1"><list><list-item label="(i)">Let {a mathematical formula}L be a language as described above, and let {a mathematical formula}A=〈A,I〉 and {a mathematical formula}A′=〈A′,I′〉 be two models for {a mathematical formula}L with the following properties:</list-item><list-item label="(ii)">Let {a mathematical formula}C be a class of models. Then {a mathematical formula}A=〈A,I〉 is an optimal model in {a mathematical formula}C iff {a mathematical formula}A∈C and there is no model in {a mathematical formula}C that is more normal than {a mathematical formula}A.</list-item><list-item label="(iii)">Let Δ be a set of sentences. Then {a mathematical formula}Δ⊨cφ iff φ is true in all optimal models of Δ.</list-item></list></paragraph><paragraph>Notice that in (i) of this definition nothing is said about the interpretation of ordinary predicates. {a mathematical formula}A can be at least as normal as {a mathematical formula}A′, while for all {a mathematical formula}P∈L0, the interpretations {a mathematical formula}I(P) and {a mathematical formula}I′(P) are totally different. However, in practice we are always looking for the most normal models within a given class {a mathematical formula}C, and it may very well happen that within {a mathematical formula}C the interpretation of the ordinary predicates is heavily constrained or even fixed.</paragraph><paragraph>If {a mathematical formula}Δ⊨cφ, we say that φ follows by circumscription from Δ. Here is an example.{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>This can be formalized as{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>It is easy to check that the conclusion Bj follows by circumscription from the premises.</paragraph><paragraph>This example illustrates why the abnormality predicates have a double index referring to both the antecedent and the consequent of the rule, rather than a single one referring to just the antecedent. It is not sufficient to distinguish between normal and abnormal A's, and formalize a sentence like Adults normally have a bank account as {a mathematical formula}∀x((Ax∧¬AbAx)→Bx). The distinction has to be more fine grained. An object with the property A can be a normal A in some respects and an abnormal A in other. Even though John is an abnormal adult in not having a driver's license, he is a normal adult in having a bank account, or at least we want to be able to conclude by default that he is. If we had formalized the argument in the following way, we would not have gotten very far.{sup:4}{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>Let us now look at the case of conflicting defaults introduced at the end of section 1. The formalized version looks like this:{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>Unfortunately, in this simple set up the conclusion {a mathematical formula}¬Ec does not follow from the premises. We find two kinds of optimal models: in some the sentences {a mathematical formula}¬AbSAc, {a mathematical formula}¬AbS¬Ec, and {a mathematical formula}AbAEc hold, which is fine, but in the other the sentences {a mathematical formula}¬AbSAc, {a mathematical formula}AbS¬Ec, and {a mathematical formula}¬AbAEc are true.</paragraph><paragraph>Recall that in the informal discussion of this example it was suggested that the three default rules involved together imply that objects with property S are exceptional A's; normal A's have the property E, but normal S's don't, even though normal S's do have property A.</paragraph><paragraph>In the next section we will see how one can enforce that in all models in which these three defaults hold, also the formula {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx→AbAEx) will be true. Once we have this, the only optimal models will be models in which {a mathematical formula}¬AbSAc, {a mathematical formula}¬AbS¬Ec, and {a mathematical formula}¬AbAEc are true, which means that the conclusion follows.</paragraph><paragraph>The circumscriptive theory developed below differs from other circumscriptive theories in various ways. We will illustrate these differences by comparing our set up with the set up of the theory developed in [4] and [5] by Bonatti et al. for description logic.{sup:5}</paragraph><paragraph>Bonatti et al. introduce abnormality predicates with only one index, and write for example Whale ⊑ {a mathematical formula}Abmammal to indicate that whales are abnormal mammals. As we pointed out above, this way it gets difficult, if not impossible, to deal properly with different – independent – default properties of the same kind of objects. Unfortunately, the paper does not discuss this problem.{sup:6}</paragraph><paragraph>Secondly, the strategy Bonatti et al. use to deal with cases of conflicting defaults differs from the strategy we will use. They introduce a priority order ≺ on the set of abnormality predicates, the idea being that if {a mathematical formula}AbA≺AbB, minimizing {a mathematical formula}AbA has preference over minimizing {a mathematical formula}AbB. It is not really clear how this priority ordering comes about. “The user can specify priorities between minimized predicates” is one thing Bonatti et al. say about this, but they add that these priorities normally reflect the Specificity Principle: if A is a more specific concept than B, then {a mathematical formula}AbA≺AbB.</paragraph><paragraph>The ‘if’ in the last sentence cannot be an ‘if and only if’. Specificity is not all that matters in deciding which defaults are applicable in a given situation. Consider for example{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>Read ‘Sx as ‘x is a student’ and ‘Ax as ‘x is an adult’. It is impossible that both {a mathematical formula}¬AbSAc and {a mathematical formula}¬AbA¬Sc hold. Intuitively, minimizing {a mathematical formula}AbSA should have priority in this case, enabling the conclusion that Ac is presumably true. But S is not more specific than A – not at least in the sense that Bonatti et al. give to this phrase. On their account, concept S is more specific than P if the extension of S is a subset of the extension of P in all relevant models (i.e. all models the knowledge base allows). But in the example Sx does not strictly imply Ax.</paragraph><paragraph>Unlike Bonatti et al., we think that priority questions cannot be left to the user. It is not a pragmatic matter to decide which defaults apply in which circumstances. It's not something to decide ad hoc. It is a matter of semantics. That some of the arguments discussed in this paper are valid and other arguments are not, is because ‘normally’ means what it means. We think of ‘normally’ as a logical constant next to ‘not’, ‘necessarily’, ‘sometimes’ etc., but differing from these in that its properties can only be described in a non-monotonic system.</paragraph><paragraph>Our strategy in the following fits in better with the second suggestion of Bonatti et al. We will specify an alternative to the specificity principle, and investigate the logic it generates.</paragraph></section><section label="3"><section-title>Exemption and inheritance</section-title><paragraph>There are two kinds of rules, rules that allow for exceptions and rules that do not allow for exceptions. So far we talked only about the first kind, but we also want to discuss the second kind. In order to do so, sentences of the form {a mathematical formula}∀x(φ(x)→ψ(x)) can get a special status as strict rules. These strict rules are to be distinguished from universal sentences that are only accidentally true, and they will be treated differently.{sup:7}</paragraph><paragraph>The general set up will be this: Let Σ be a finite set of default rules and strict rules and Π be a set of sentences. Think of {a mathematical formula}I=〈Σ,Π〉 as the information of some agent at some time, where Σ is the set of rules the agent is acquainted with, and Π the agent's factual information. We correlate with I a pair {a mathematical formula}〈UI,FI〉, and call this the (information) state generated by I. {a mathematical formula}UI is called the universe of the state. The elements of {a mathematical formula}UI are models of Σ, but not all models of Σ are allowed. The universe {a mathematical formula}UI must satisfy some additional constraint that will be discussed below. {a mathematical formula}FI consists of all models in {a mathematical formula}UI that are models of Π.</paragraph><paragraph>In this set up validity is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} Read ‘{a mathematical formula}Σ,Π⊨dφ’ as ‘φ follows by default from Σ and Π’.</paragraph><paragraph>To explain the constraint, it is necessary to introduce some technical notions.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 3.1"><section-title>Complying</section-title></paragraph><list><list-item label="(i)">Suppose {a mathematical formula}A⊨∀x(φ(x)↝ψ(x)), and let d be an element of the domain{sup:8} of {a mathematical formula}A.

But notice that the definition allows for the following situations:</paragraph><list><list-item label="•">The object d complies with {a mathematical formula}∀x(φ(x)↝ψ(x)), but d does not satisfy {a mathematical formula}φ(x).</list-item><list-item label="•">The object d satisfies {a mathematical formula}φ(x) and {a mathematical formula}ψ(x), but d does not comply with {a mathematical formula}∀x(φ(x)↝ψ(x)).</list-item></list><paragraph>We will present examples later on. For now, just take ‘comply’ as a technical term.</paragraph><section label="3.1"><section-title>The exemption principle</section-title><paragraph>The constraint we will impose on {a mathematical formula}UI is motivated by the following minimal requirement. If the only information about some object is that it has property P, it must be valid to infer by default that this object complies with all the default rules for objects with property P.{sup:9} What would be the use of these rules if they would not at least allow this inference?</paragraph><paragraph>It may seem easy to satisfy this requirement, but it is not.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 3.2"><list><list-item label="(i)">An exemption clause is a formula of the form {a mathematical formula}∀x(φ(x)→⋁δ∈ΔAbδx).Here we write ‘{a mathematical formula}Abδ’ to refer to the abnormality predicate of the default rule δ.

So, {a mathematical formula}⋁δ∈ΔAbδx is a disjunction of a finite number of abnormality predicates.{sup:10}</list-item><list-item label="(ii)">Let Σ be a set of rules. {a mathematical formula}Σφ(x) is the set of rules in Σ with antecedent {a mathematical formula}φ(x).</list-item><list-item label="(iii)">The exemption clause {a mathematical formula}∀x(φ(x)→⋁δ∈ΔAbδx) is an exemption clause for Σ iff {a mathematical formula}Σ⊨∀x(φ(x)→⋁δ∈Δ∪Σφ(x)Abδx).{sup:11}</list-item></list></paragraph><paragraph>To see how these definitions work, consider again{a mathematical formula} Here {a mathematical formula}ΣSx={∀x(Sx↝Ax),∀x(Sx↝¬Ex)}. Let {a mathematical formula}Δ={∀x(Ax↝Ex)}. Clearly, there is no model such that some object in its domain satisfies Sx and complies with {a mathematical formula}Δ∪ΣSx. So,{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>By (iii) above this means that {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx→⋁δ∈ΔAbδx), i.e. {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx→AbAEx), is an exemption clause for Σ, the idea being that objects with property S are, so to speak, exempted from the rule that A's are normally E.</paragraph><paragraph>The word ‘exempted’ suggests that default rules are some kind of normative rules. Indeed, often it is helpful to think of them that way. The use of the word ‘normally’, already suggests that we are dealing with a kind of norms here. To count as a normal S, S's must be A, and to count as a normal A, A's must be E, but here an exception is made for the {a mathematical formula}S's. {a mathematical formula}S's must be A, but they do not have to be E, they are not subjected to this rule. Actually, for them the opposite holds, to count as a normal S they must be not E.</paragraph><paragraph>‘Being exempted from a rule’ does not mean ‘being an exception to the rule’: The {a mathematical formula}S's don't have to be E, but this does not mean they are, in fact, not E.</paragraph><paragraph>In the following definition it is made explicit for any set of rules Σ which kinds of objects are exempted from which rules in Σ.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 3.3">Let Σ be a set of rules, and let Π be an arbitrary set of formulas.</paragraph><list><list-item label="(i)">The exemption extension{a mathematical formula}Σ∈ of Σ is given by{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Σ0∈=Σ and {a mathematical formula}Σn+1∈=Σn∈∪{φ|φ is an exemption clause for Σn∈}.</list-item><list-item label="(ii)">The state generated by {a mathematical formula}I=〈Σ,Π〉 is the state {a mathematical formula}〈UI,FI〉 given by</list-item></list><paragraph>Notice that {a mathematical formula}Σ∈ has the following property, which we will call the Exemption Principle.{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>{a mathematical formula}Σ∈ is defined inductively. By adding exemption clauses to a set of rules a new set of rules is created which may generate new exemption clauses, etc.{sup:12} Given that Σ is finite, there are only finitely many possible exemption clauses. So, after finitely many steps a fixed point is reached. {a mathematical formula}Σ∈ is the weakest extension of Σ for which the exemption principle holds.</paragraph><paragraph>On the face of it, the exemption principle is not very strong. It just says that if the rules for objects with the property expressed by {a mathematical formula}φ(x) are incompatible with the rules in some set Δ, then every object with the property expressed by {a mathematical formula}φ(x) is exempted from at least one of the rules in Δ.</paragraph><paragraph>Without the exemption principle the minimal requirement cannot be met. If the principle does not hold, then there exists an optimal model {a mathematical formula}A, a property {a mathematical formula}φ(x), and an entity d in the domain of {a mathematical formula}A such that d satisfies {a mathematical formula}φ(x), but d does not comply with at least one of the rules in {a mathematical formula}Σφ(x), because instead d complies with a rule that is not compatible with the rules in {a mathematical formula}Σφ(x).</paragraph><paragraph>With the exemption principle this cannot happen.</paragraph><paragraph label="Proof">Minimal requirementSuppose{a mathematical formula}∀x(φ(x)↝ψ(x))∈Σ. Then{a mathematical formula}Σ,{φ(c)}⊨dψ(c).To determine whether {a mathematical formula}Σ,{φ(c)}⊨dψ(c), we have to look at the state {a mathematical formula}〈UI,FI〉 generated by {a mathematical formula}I=〈Σ,{φ(c)}〉 and check that every optimal model in {a mathematical formula}FI has the property that the object named c complies with {a mathematical formula}Σφ(x).Recall that {a mathematical formula}UI contains the models of {a mathematical formula}Σ∈, and that {a mathematical formula}FI contains all models in {a mathematical formula}UI in which {a mathematical formula}φ(c) is true.Now, consider any model {a mathematical formula}A=〈A,I〉 in {a mathematical formula}FI in which the object {a mathematical formula}I(c) does not comply with {a mathematical formula}Σφ(x). We will show that {a mathematical formula}A is not optimal.Let Δ be the set of defaults in {a mathematical formula}Σ∈ with which {a mathematical formula}I(c) complies. Apparently, {a mathematical formula}Σ∈⊭∀x(φ(x)→⋁δ∈ΔAbδx). By the exemption principle this means that {a mathematical formula}Σ∈⊭∀x(φ(x)→⋁δ∈Δ∪Σφ(x)Abδx). Hence, there exists a model {a mathematical formula}A′=〈A′,I′〉 in {a mathematical formula}UI such that some element {a mathematical formula}d0 in {a mathematical formula}A′ satisfies {a mathematical formula}(φ(x)∧¬⋁δ∈Δ∪Σφ(x)Abδx).Now, let {a mathematical formula}A″=〈A″,I″〉 be defined as follows:<list>{a mathematical formula}A″=A;For individual constants a, {a mathematical formula}I″(a)=I(a);For P an ordinary predicate or an abnormality predicate,Consider any quantifier-free formula </list><paragraph>{a mathematical formula}θ(x) in which no individual constant occurs. Clearly, if {a mathematical formula}d≠I″(c), then d satisfies {a mathematical formula}θ(x) in {a mathematical formula}A″ iff d satisfies {a mathematical formula}θ(x) in {a mathematical formula}A, while {a mathematical formula}I″(c) satisfies {a mathematical formula}θ(x) in {a mathematical formula}A″ iff {a mathematical formula}I′(c) satisfies {a mathematical formula}θ(x) in {a mathematical formula}A′.Given that all sentences of {a mathematical formula}Σ∈ are of the form {a mathematical formula}∀xθ(x) with θ as described, {a mathematical formula}A″ will be a model of {a mathematical formula}Σ∈.

Now, it follows in one step from the inheritance principle that {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx→AbQRx)∈Σ∈.</paragraph><paragraph>Without an appeal to the inheritance principle the proof is a bit longer. We give it here because it illustrates why Definition 3.3 (i) is inductive. Note first that {a mathematical formula}∀x(Px→AbQRx)∈Σ1∈. Given that {a mathematical formula}⊨∀x(Sx→(Px∨¬Px)), it follows that {a mathematical formula}Σ1∈⊨∀x(Sx→(AbQRx∨AbSPx)). But then {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx→AbQRx)∈Σ2∈.</paragraph><paragraph>By applying the exemption principle to the last three rules we find that {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx→AbP¬Rx)∈Σ∈. So, the S's, which in optimal circumstances are both P and Q, are exempted both from the rule that P's are normally not R and from the rule that Q's are normally R. They are normally R for independent reasons. As such, the example illustrates the fact that it is possible for an object not to comply with a rule whereas both the antecedent and the consequent of the rule hold for it. Objects with the property S do not comply with the rule {a mathematical formula}∀x(Qx↝Rx), but in optimal circumstances they will have both the properties Q and R.</paragraph><paragraph>In its general form the inheritance principle runs as follows.</paragraph><paragraph label="Proposition 3.5">Inheritance principleLet{a mathematical formula}〈UI,FI〉be the state generated by the information{a mathematical formula}I=〈Σ,Π〉.

This means that the only default conclusion to be drawn is Pc.</paragraph><paragraph>The reason we bring this up is that several authors have questioned the validity of Defeasible Modus Tollens with putative counterexamples like the following:{a mathematical formula} However, the only thing this example shows is that one has to be very careful in providing ‘intuitive’ counterexamples when dealing with default arguments. One must be sure that the premises faithfully represent all one knows about the matter at issue.</paragraph><paragraph>In this case we know in fact more than the premises state.

This is much weaker than saying that the rule {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx↝Px) implies the rule {a mathematical formula}∀x(¬Px↝¬Sx). What we have at best is this: if all you know is the rule {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx↝Px), it follows by default that {a mathematical formula}∀x(¬Px↝¬Sx). But it is important to realize that this conclusion expresses just an accidental truth, not a rule.{sup:13} And notice that {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx↝Px),Sa,¬Pa⊭d∀x(¬Px↝¬Sx), so this accidental conclusion is easily defeasible, whereas in the same context we can still apply defeasible Modus Tollens: {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx↝Px),Sa,¬Pa,¬Pb⊨d¬Sb.</paragraph></section></section><section label="3.4"><section-title>Coherence</section-title><paragraph>Every set Σ of default rules is consistent in the strict logical sense of the word.{sup:14} This does not mean that every such set is okay.

We can apply the exemption principle (take {a mathematical formula}Δ=∅ and {a mathematical formula}φ(x)=Sx) to find that {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx→⊥) is an exemption clause for Σ.

Applying the exemption principle once more yields {a mathematical formula}∀x(Rx→⊥)∈Σ∈.</paragraph><paragraph>A third example is given by{a mathematical formula} Again, this does not sound like an acceptable theory.

Hence, by the exemption principle {a mathematical formula}∀x((Sx∧Qx)→AbSxPxx)∈Σ∈; similarly, {a mathematical formula}∀x((Sx∧¬Qx)→AbSPx)∈Σ∈. Hence, {a mathematical formula}Σ∈⊨∀x(Sx→AbSPx). But then {a mathematical formula}∀x(Sx→⊥)∈Σ∈.</paragraph><paragraph>The above leads to the following definition.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 3.6">A set of rules Σ is coherent iff for every {a mathematical formula}φ(x) which is the antecedent of some rule in Σ, {a mathematical formula}Σ∈∪{∃xφ(x)} is consistent.</paragraph><paragraph>A set of rules is incoherent if it is logically impossible to satisfy the minimal requirement. In such a case there is some property such that no object with this property can comply with all the rules for objects with this property. Given the exemption principle, no such objects are allowed.</paragraph><paragraph>As will become clear in due course, for inheritance networks we can give an exact syntactic characterization of the sets of rules that are incoherent.</paragraph></section><section label="3.5"><section-title>Is the exemption principle all there is to it?</section-title><paragraph>We have presented the exemption principle as a minimal constraint – a constraint that must be imposed on a circumscriptive theory to meet the minimal requirement. We have seen that this principle has many, sometimes surprising consequences, and deals successfully with a lot of examples. So, naturally the question arises if this constraint is all one needs to settle questions of priority between conflicting defaults.</paragraph><paragraph>One might think that the next example shows that the answer is ‘no’.{sup:15} Consider the following set of premises.{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>Here, one might want to conclude first that Tc and Qc – after all these are immediate default consequences of Sc and Pc – and then make a second step further up to Uc and Rc – why stop before we hit a direct conflict? This is how we reasoned when we discussed the kite example in section 3.3.1. Why wouldn't this kind of forward chaining go through here?</paragraph><paragraph>There is, in fact, a huge difference between this example and the example in section 3.3.1, which is best brought out by comparing the pictures. In example 3.3.1 we have one path – one line of argument – leading up from Sc to the conclusions Rc and Tc. Here we have for each of the properties {a mathematical formula}P,Q,R,S,T,U,V two different paths – two completely independent lines of argument – one leading to the conclusion that c has the property concerned, the other leading to the conclusion that c does not have the property concerned.{sup:16} There is no reason to think, given the information at hand, that the one line of argument leads to a more normal situation than the other. This means that no conclusion can be drawn here. Indeed, on our account it is not valid to conclude that Uc or Rc; it is not even valid to conclude that Tc or Qc.</paragraph><paragraph>So, we don't think this example shows that the exemption principle is too weak. But of course, the possibility is not excluded that somebody will come up with a more convincing example. Besides, also in the absence of such an example, it might be enlightening – perhaps only from a mathematical point of view – to investigate possible strengthenings of the exemption principle.</paragraph><paragraph>We have to leave this to another occasion. For now, we just content ourselves setting a new minimum – the old one being the specificity principle – to principles regulating the priority ordering between conflicting defaults.</paragraph></section></section><section label="4"><section-title>Networks</section-title><paragraph>Inheritance networks are, simply put, the kind of structures we have been picturing to illustrate the examples.

We will refer to an arc from u to v as ‘ uv’ if this arc is positive, as ‘ {a mathematical formula}uv−’ if it is negative, as ‘ {a mathematical formula}uv⁎’ if it is strict positive and as ‘ {a mathematical formula}uv⁎−’ if it is strict negative.</paragraph><paragraph>All nodes except one represent properties.

We have built two theories based on this principle, one within a circumscriptive framework, and the other in terms of inheritance networks. In the appendix we will prove a completeness theorem showing that arguments that can be expressed in both systems are valid on the one account iff they are valid on the other.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite the length of this paper, we have only taken the first steps developing these systems. Undoubtedly, a more systematic model theoretic study of the circumscriptive part will result in a shorter and more elegant proof of the completeness theorem. We also think that on the algorithmic side further investigations may yield simplifications. For example, it will become clear in the appendix that things get a lot less complicated if the networks do not have cycles. Finally, a study like this should be complemented by a study answering the question under which conditions a set of default rules can be safely adopted as a guiding line for taking decisions. Maybe this is a question for methodologists rather than for logicians, but the answer is important to everybody interested in common sense reasoning.</paragraph></section></content><appendices><section label="Appendix A"><section-title>Completeness of the network algorithm</section-title><paragraph>When defining the d and D functions we suggested that d models the effect of a weakened version of the exemption principle and D the effect of the inheritance principle.

We could remedy this defect by introducing the same abnormality predicate {a mathematical formula}Abφ(⋅)ψ(⋅) for all pairs {a mathematical formula}〈φ(x),ψ(x)〉, independent of the free variable x occurring in {a mathematical formula}φ(x) and {a mathematical formula}ψ(x). Here ‘⋅’ refers to a symbol that does not belong to the vocabulary of {a mathematical formula}L0, and by {a mathematical formula}φ(⋅), we mean the expression that one obtains from {a mathematical formula}φ(x) by replacing each free occurrence of x by an occurrence of ⋅.Some readers may insist that on top of this we should enforce that whenever {a mathematical formula}φ(x) is logical equivalent to {a mathematical formula}χ(x), and {a mathematical formula}ψ(x) to {a mathematical formula}θ(x), {a mathematical formula}∀x(φ(x)↝ψ(x)) gets equivalent to {a mathematical formula}∀x(χ(x)↝θ(x)). This can be done by stipulating that we are only interested in models that assign the same extension to {a mathematical formula}Abφ(⋅)ψ(⋅) and {a mathematical formula}Abχ(⋅)θ(⋅) if {a mathematical formula}φ(x) is logical equivalent to {a mathematical formula}χ(x) and {a mathematical formula}ψ(x) to {a mathematical formula}θ(x). However, for our purposes, we can keep things simple.</note-para><note-para label="4">The first to point this out was John McCarthy in [2].</note-para><note-para label="5">The expressive power of the languages of description logic differs from the expressive power of monadic first order languages, but the differences are not relevant for our discussion.</note-para><note-para label="6">Dealing properly with independent default properties is also a problem for theories that analyze the default implication if …, then normally … as a variable strict conditional. Here Delgrande [6], Asher and Morreau [7], and Boutilier [8] can serve as examples. The only modal theory we know of that gets this right is the one presented in Veltman [9].</note-para><note-para label="7">It is tempting to introduce a necessity operator in the object language to distinguish rules from accidental statements. We resist this temptation, making the distinction only at a meta-level, because we want to stay as closely as possible to the original circumscriptive framework.</note-para><note-para label="8">Let {a mathematical formula}A=〈A,I〉 be a model. Usually, the set {a mathematical formula}A is called the universe of {a mathematical formula}A, but since that phrase is already in use for something else we refer to {a mathematical formula}A as the domain of {a mathematical formula}A.</note-para><note-para label="9">The earliest place we know where this requirement is explicitly stated is on page 63 in Geffner [10]: “Given the evidence {a mathematical formula}E={p} we can apply a default {a mathematical formula}p→qeven in the presence of sets of defaults in conflict with{a mathematical formula}p→q.”</note-para><note-para label="10">By definition, if {a mathematical formula}Δ=∅, {a mathematical formula}⋁δ∈ΔAbδx=⊥.</note-para><note-para label="11">Here and elsewhere ‘{a mathematical formula}Γ⊨ψ’ means that Γ entails ψ in classical logic.</note-para><note-para label="12">An example is given below, when the inheritance principle is discussed.</note-para><note-para label="13">Here, it would help if we had introduced a necessity operator □ in the object language.

In all the inheritance algorithms we know of it is a necessary condition for {a mathematical formula}b/¬b to follow from a that there is a positive/negative path from a to b.</note-para><note-para label="21">The example has been around since 1987, and is due to Ginsberg, but he did not publish it in print until 1993 in [12].</note-para><note-para label="22">This is what most people working in this field want. Horty [13] provides a counterexample, but it concerns normative rules rather than defaults. See Prakken [14] for an insightful discussion.</note-para><note-para label="23">In this paper the starting point was the notion {a mathematical formula}⊨d and we have been looking for a consequence relation ⊢ on networks matching this notion. It would be interesting to go the other way around and represent, say, the network algorithm developed in Thomason, Horty &amp; Touretzky [15] in circumscriptive terms. We have tried to do so, but so far failed. Still, we think it should be possible. In [16] Bochman develops a theory in the framework of Reiter's Default Logic [17] matching the network algorithm developed in Thomason et al. [15] (as presented in Horty [18]). In Qian &amp; Irani [19] a policy is given for representing default theories developed in Reiter's framework in a circumscriptive set up. So, maybe combining the insights of these two papers will do the job.</note-para><note-para label="24">Since networks do not distinguish between individuals and properties, the lift will represent individuals with predicates. A premise like ‘John is an adult’, which in the circumscription framework could be represented as Aj, is represented in an inheritance network as a strict arc from J to A, the lift of which is {a mathematical formula}∀x(Jx→Ax). This is clumsy, but, fortunately, it does not lead to any real problems.</note-para><note-para label="25">We are a bit sloppy here.
