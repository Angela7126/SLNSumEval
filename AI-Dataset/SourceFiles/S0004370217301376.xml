Different notions of bisimulation are suitable for these logics. We provide correspondence between bisimulation and modal equivalence on image-finite models for these logics. Expressivity and axiomatizations are investigated for models without restrictions, and for models with equivalence relations for all agents (modeling knowledge) and awareness introspection (agents know what they are aware of). We show that the logic of speculative knowledge is as expressive as the logic of explicit knowledge, and the logic of implicit knowledge is more expressive than the two other logics. We also present expressivity results for more restricted languages. We then provide and compare axiomatizations for the three logics; the axiomatizations for speculative knowledge are novel.

When does an agent whose knowledge or beliefs are modeled in these structures know exactly the same in both? Can an agent have knowledge about things that it is unaware of? In this paper, we provide answers to all three questions. We propose a notion of awareness bisimulation to answer the first question: structures contain the same information if they are awareness bisimilar. The answer to the second question is a corollary of that: they should be the same (awareness bisimilar) for anything that the agent is aware of. And by employing awareness bisimilarity we propose a notion of speculative knowledge with which we can reason about unawareness. This we can do while preserving the expressivity of explicit knowledge. We provide an exhaustive comparison of explicit, implicit, and speculative knowledge in terms of bisimulation characterizations, expressivity, and axiomatizations.</paragraph><paragraph>Our work is rooted in the tradition of epistemic logic [21] and in particular multi-agent epistemic logic [26], [7]. An early paper extending knowledge with awareness is Levesque's A Logic of Implicit and Explicit Belief[24]. In [24], what would later be coined ‘unawareness’ in [6] is modeled as the value ‘unknown’ for a proposition, which means ‘neither true nor false’, such that apart from true and false a fourth value is ‘both true and false’. Levesque's analysis of implicit and explicit belief then only uses three values, not the value ‘true and false’. Such fourth-valued logics are suitable for reasoning about inconsistency in communicating databases. They have since then followed a different line of development [2], [10], [30], which we will recall when reviewing dynamics of awareness, later. Levesque permits belief (and thus some form of awareness) of tautologies containing unaware variables. This is not taken along in the subsequent [6], but remained a contested topic in the awareness literature, e.g., in [28, p. 269], where it is discussed whether one should always be aware of {a mathematical formula}1=1.</paragraph><paragraph>In Belief, Awareness, and Limited Reasoning[6], Fagin and Halpern propose a framework for awareness and knowledge that can be seen as a further development of [24], and that obtained foundational status in the knowledge and awareness corpus of literature that since then evolved, also incorporating independent lines of research in economics, including [6], [27], [28], [13], [19], [15]; see also the survey [33]. We then have a modality for implicit knowledge, interpreted as modal accessibility, a modality for awareness of formulas, and a modality for explicit knowledge, interpreted as implicit knowledge plus awareness of a formula.</paragraph><paragraph>Roughly, one can distinguish a more syntactically flavored approach, wherein an agent is aware of the formulas in a given set, and where this set is a parameter in a given state of information [6], [13], [35], from a more semantically flavored approach, wherein the agent is aware of all formulas only containing a subset (the aware variables) of the set of all propositional variables [6], [27], [28], [19].</paragraph><paragraph>The reason to call the former ‘syntactic’ is that it allows, for example, an agent to be aware of {a mathematical formula}p∧q but not of {a mathematical formula}q∧p, namely when the former is in the set of aware formulas but the latter is not. In particular, we can then have that the agent is aware of p and {a mathematical formula}p→q but not of q, so that, even if the agent knows that p and knows that {a mathematical formula}p→q, she still does not know q because she is not aware of q. Thus, the rationality of the agent is bounded or limited. Other principally syntactic approaches include [20], [12], [16].</paragraph><paragraph>The ‘semantic’ approaches include those wherein the agent is aware of all formulas only using a subset of all propositional variables. The reason to call this ‘semantic’ might be its popularity among economists using partitional information structures to define awareness. These are logic-free, and thus syntax-free, approaches, so to speak: we can also identify a propositional variable with its denotation in a model, a semantic proposition. Within the restriction of the aware variables, agents may be fully rational. This should rather be called lack of conception than lack of awareness. The partitional information structures of [27], [28] can be seen as the single-agent case of the complete lattice of spaces of [19], and are equivalent to the (single-agent) class of epistemic awareness models in which each agent knows what she is aware of [13]; the complete lattices of spaces are equivalent to the same (multi-agent) class of epistemic awareness models in [15]. Our proposal falls straight into the semantic corner.</paragraph><paragraph>In such multi-agent logics with implicit and explicit knowledge, implicit knowledge is a primitive notion needed to define explicit knowledge, and one should be careful when mixing the two notions. Consider the following example. ‘Knowledge’ means ‘explicit knowledge’.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 1">We are both quite interested in the outcome of the presidential elections. A candidate has illegally employed immigrants (proposition p). We both know this.(X) A scenario wherein you are uncertain whether I know p (i), is different from a scenario wherein you know that I know p (ii). And my knowledge about what you know about me may then also be different. This is standard multi-agent epistemic logic.(Y) Let us now assume that you are uncertain whether I am aware of p. It may then be that I know that you are uncertain whether I am aware of p. It is not problematic for me to reason about what you think of me in such a case.(Z) Let us instead assume that you are unaware of p. So now, it is no longer the case that we both know that p. You don't know p, as you are unaware of p. You then cannot distinguish the scenario wherein I know p from a scenario wherein I don't know p, or the scenario wherein I am aware of p from a scenario wherein I am unaware of p. (If I am unaware of p, it is irrelevant whether I implicitly know p (i), or not (ii). Explicit knowledge is all the agents have.) Such scenarios are indistinguishable given your current level of awareness. Consequently, what I know about your knowledge should also be the same in both scenarios, and in particular my knowledge about your knowledge about me.{sup:1} We will see that we can distinguish the scenarios under Z in a logic with implicit and explicit knowledge and awareness, but not in a logic with only explicit knowledge and awareness. These logics have been well investigated, but not what their distinguishing power is on a class of structures. In modal logics, determining the difference between structures requires a notion of bisimilarity. We propose different notions including one called awareness bisimilarity.</paragraph><paragraph>With awareness bisimilarity at our disposal, we can also consider other epistemic notions. We define an epistemic operator called speculative knowledge, which not only varies over all the propositions the agent is aware of in the accessible states, but also over all the propositions that agent is unaware of in the accessible states, by way of considering all models that are the same as the actual one with respect to the aware variables, i.e., models that are awareness bisimilar for that agent to the actual model. In other words, it quantifies over bisimilar states. Propositional quantifiers were proposed by Fine in [9], which was followed up by work on bisimulation quantifiers in [44], [22], [11]. Speculative knowledge incorporates bisimulation quantification over unaware variables. Therefore, the speculative knowledge semantics permits knowledge of unawareness. Speculative knowledge will be reviewed in Section 3. It has been proposed in [37], [38] in a setting also considering awareness of agents, becoming unaware, and explicit quantification (see Footnote 3, later). It is as expressive as explicit knowledge, a main result in this paper. Thus, we get the benefits of resolving an issue deemed problematic by the community for a long time (see the concerns voiced in [24], [28], above) without having to pay a price. The following is an example of knowledge of unawareness.{sup:2}</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 2">My grandmother drives a car. She is aware that the engine can be broken. Moreover, if the engine is broken she knows it and if the engine is not broken she knows it too. But it happens that in modern cars there are sensitive control units, essentially computers that control the functioning of the engine, that can be broken too. In particular, if the engine is broken, the control unit will break as well. The control unit can also break without the engine going broken. This can be easily known from the repair shop. My grandmother, being of an older generation, is clearly unaware of the control unit. But she certainly considers it possible that the car mechanic in the repair shop would know about any device that is causally linked to the engine. Based on this speculation, she regularly has her car checked up, even when the engine is not broken. (See Example 16 in Section 3.)</paragraph><paragraph>Proposals to model awareness of unawareness include [16], [17], [45], [1]. Our knowledge of unawareness compares to such awareness of unawareness. Halpern and Rêgo [16] use quantification over variables to formalize propositions such as “the agent knows that there is some fact that she is unaware of but that another agent is aware of.” These ‘quantifier variables’ are different from the propositional variables. Their setting is for ‘syntactic’ awareness, of a set of formulas, and also applies to (‘semantic’) awareness of all formulas containing aware propositional variables. They assume awareness introspection. In their setting, the proposition that an agent does not know whether she is aware of all formulas is not satisfiable. As this seems desirable, [17] introduced a variant of the logic wherein to each state is associated a (possibly different) set of propositional variables of which agents can be aware or unaware. This amounts to having two levels of unawareness: in the first place, there are the unaware versus aware propositional variables in a state, and in the second place there are the variables not in the language for that state. Quantifying is allowed over variables of the first kind but not over variables of the second kind, of which the agent is therefore, so to speak, even more unaware. Although operating on different modeling principles, [45], [1] also allow for awareness of unawareness, and for levels of unawareness; [1] has operators for “agent i has full awareness” and for “agent j is aware of more than agent i”. We can thus say that the agent has explicit knowledge of her lack of full awareness, and also that she is unaware of some fact of which another agent is aware. A probability-based framework modeling different levels of (un)awareness is given in [23]. For yet other work, see [33, Section 3.5]. Section 7 will give a more technical comparison between [17] and our proposal.</paragraph><paragraph>We now survey the dynamics of awareness. Although not the focus of this investigation, it demonstrates the relevance of our results for artificial intelligence, decision theory, and economics. Our results on the dynamics of awareness and knowledge have been reported in [37], [39], [40], [38]: all agents simultaneously becoming aware of a propositional variable in [37], agents differently becoming aware in [39] (i.e., action models for awareness; awareness of an action means awareness of its preconditions and postconditions); the axiomatization of the dynamic logic of explicit knowledge and awareness in [40]; becoming aware and becoming unaware of agents, and becoming unaware of propositional variables, in [38]. Becoming unaware should rather be seen as ‘conscious’ abstraction than as things ‘subconsciously’ gradually slipping out of one's mind. Other recent studies on awareness dynamics are [20] and [12], [35], [41]. The works by Velazquez-Quesada and collaborators typically consider syntactic awareness (instead of the ‘semantic’ awareness of all formulas containing the aware propositional variables), for example, making the reasoning agent aware of a formula that is a conclusion in a chain of reasoning (it is dynamics of access). Schipper gives many other pointers to dynamics of awareness in [33, page 140]. Dynamics of awareness is important in game theoretical settings, where awareness of actions may determine strategies and equilibria, so that making agents aware of more actions may change their behavior. Works include [18], [31], [8], [25]. From game theory and economics it is only a short way to consider unawareness in epistemic planning. Recalling our description above of ‘becoming unaware’ as ‘abstraction’, the dynamics of knowledge and awareness are relevant for planning with abstraction[29], and in particular for epistemic planning[4]. Finally recalling the original view of an unaware variable as the unknown value for that variable in a four-valued setting [24], also known as reasoning about impossible possible worlds, recent studies refresh this comparison of three-valued and four-valued approaches [14] or introduce dynamics, for example on top of epistemic bilattices [32].</paragraph><paragraph>Example of the interaction of knowledge and awareness  To explain our treatment of knowledge, awareness, and change of knowledge and awareness, we first give an abstract single-agent example, that is technically simple, and we then give an intuitively more compelling multi-agent example, that is technically more complex.</paragraph><paragraph>Let us define ‘agent i knows φ explicitly’, notation {a mathematical formula}KiEφ, as {a mathematical formula}□iφ∧Aiφ, where {a mathematical formula}□i stands for ‘agent i implicitly knows φ’, interpreted with modal accessibility and where {a mathematical formula}Aiφ stands for ‘agent i is aware of φ’, interpreted as a domain function {a mathematical formula}A such that {a mathematical formula}Aiφ is true at state s iff {a mathematical formula}φ∈Ai(s). We only consider awareness generated by propositional variables.</paragraph><paragraph>In the presence of implicit knowledge, this definition of explicit knowledge can lead to counterintuitive situations. Consider the models M and {a mathematical formula}M′ in Fig. 1. It suits the purpose of the exposition that the accessibility relation here corresponds to a standard modality, not to knowledge (which is interpreted on models with equivalence relations). As said, in a given state an agent explicitly knows a proposition if it is aware of the proposition and if the proposition is true in all accessible states. Consider state t and agent i. The agent i is unaware of p at {a mathematical formula}(M,t), and therefore of the value of p in the single accessible state u: from her perspective, {a mathematical formula}(M,t) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,t′) are the same. But if that is so, then, because t is the single accessible state from s (and {a mathematical formula}t′ from {a mathematical formula}s′), the pointed models {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′) should also be the same for her. We will propose a notion of bisimilarity for which {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′) are indeed bisimilar.</paragraph><paragraph>Now here is the surprise: in the language with awareness and modal box, states {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′) are not modally equivalent. Recalling that explicit knowledge {a mathematical formula}KiEφ is {a mathematical formula}□iφ∧Aiφ, consider {a mathematical formula}KiE□ip. This formula is true in {a mathematical formula}(M,s) but false in {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′). It seems undesirable that bisimilar models are not modally equivalent.</paragraph><paragraph>We now replay this example in a multi-agent setting, interpreted on an {a mathematical formula}S5 model (wherein all accessibility relations are equivalence relations). This appeals to our intuitions about knowledge. It is elementary to duplicate properties observed in a single-agent model with directed (asymmetric) accessibility to a multi-agent setting wherein intersecting equivalence classes for different agents force such asymmetry. Consider Fig. 2.</paragraph><paragraph>As agent i is unaware of p in the equivalence class {a mathematical formula}{t,u}, she should be indifferent to the fact that in model T the propositional variable p is true in state u, but that in model {a mathematical formula}T′p is false in {a mathematical formula}u′. Therefore, in state s, what the other agent j considers possible for i to know, should be indistinguishable as well in T and {a mathematical formula}T′. And therefore, in state w, what i considers possible for j to consider possible about i, should also be indistinguishable. So again, intuitively, these models are the same from agent i's perspective. But {a mathematical formula}KiE□j□ip is true in {a mathematical formula}(T,w) and false in {a mathematical formula}(T′,w′).</paragraph><paragraph>The problem in both examples is the presence of the □ modality. If the {a mathematical formula}KE operator is not defined by abbreviation but a primitive in the language, then the models cannot be distinguished, as we will prove. For example, unlike {a mathematical formula}KiE□p, the formula {a mathematical formula}KiEKiEp is false in both {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′). In fact, if we only have the {a mathematical formula}KiE modality for agent i, then {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′) are modally equivalent. So that the logic with {a mathematical formula}KiE and {a mathematical formula}□i must necessarily be more expressive than the logic with merely {a mathematical formula}KiE.</paragraph><paragraph>As explicit knowledge is implicit knowledge plus awareness, instead of saying that the logic with {a mathematical formula}KiE and {a mathematical formula}□i is more expressive than the logic with {a mathematical formula}KiE, we can say that the logic with {a mathematical formula}□i and {a mathematical formula}Ai is more expressive than the logic with {a mathematical formula}KiE and {a mathematical formula}Ai. This makes our story one of comparing different epistemic notions, namely comparing explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge in the presence of awareness. Alternative epistemic notions then also come to the fore, wherein we wish to focus in particular on the recently proposed notion of speculative knowledge{a mathematical formula}KiS[36], [37]. A third contestant in this comparative study is then the logic with {a mathematical formula}KiS and {a mathematical formula}Ai as primitive operators.</paragraph><paragraph>In a state s an agent i speculatively knows φ, {a mathematical formula}KiSφ, if in any i-accessible state t, in any state u indistinguishable from t as far as awareness of i is concerned, φ is true. This is exactly the sense in which {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′), or {a mathematical formula}(T,w) and {a mathematical formula}(T′,w′), are similar for i. Technically, {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′), and {a mathematical formula}(T,w) and {a mathematical formula}(T′,w′), are p awareness bisimilar. On the one hand, explicit and speculative knowledge are really different. For example, in {a mathematical formula}(M,t) it is false that {a mathematical formula}KiE(p∨¬p), for the obvious reason that the agent is not aware of p in state t. But in {a mathematical formula}(M,t) it is true that {a mathematical formula}KiS(p∨¬p), because any way in which agent i can envisage becoming aware of p will make the tautology {a mathematical formula}p∨¬p true. On the other hand (and this is main result), explicit and speculative knowledge are not really different, because the logic with {a mathematical formula}KiE and {a mathematical formula}Ai is as expressive as the logic with {a mathematical formula}KiS and {a mathematical formula}Ai.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is another peculiarity of this epistemic notion. Assume that the accessibility relation is serial, transitive, and euclidean, i.e. {a mathematical formula}KD45. These frame properties are associated with belief. You do not consider it possible that p is false but that you believe that it is true: {a mathematical formula}◇i(¬p∧□ip) is inconsistent in {a mathematical formula}KD45. Now let α be an informative event (such as a public announcement) with associated modality {a mathematical formula}〈α〉, which stands for ‘there is an execution of the action α after which’. Then even {a mathematical formula}◇i〈α〉(¬p∧□ip) is inconsistent, because this would entail {a mathematical formula}〈α〉◇i(¬p∧□ip), and again we end up with an inconsistency. The presence of awareness, as in explicit knowledge, does not matter: {a mathematical formula}LiE〈α〉(¬p∧KEip) is also inconsistent — where {a mathematical formula}LE means ‘explicitly considering possible’. However, given the action {a mathematical formula}〈A+p〉 of becoming aware of p, the formula {a mathematical formula}LiS〈A+p〉(¬p∧KiSp) is consistent: you speculatively consider it possible that you become aware of p such that p happens to be false but you (firmly) believe that it is true. We will define and motivate speculative knowledge at length and explain this particular example in detail.</paragraph><paragraph>The action {a mathematical formula}A+p, where {a mathematical formula}[A+p]φ (the necessity form of the modality) stands for ‘after all agents become aware of the propositional variable p, φ is true’, is interpreted as a Kripke model transformer, e.g., on the models M and {a mathematical formula}M′, the result would be as in Fig. 3. (Proceeding likewise on the models T and {a mathematical formula}T′ of Fig. 2 is also depicted.) Recalling the previous example, one can now easily calculate that {a mathematical formula}KiEKiEp is true in {a mathematical formula}(M+p,s), whereas it is false in {a mathematical formula}(M+p′,s′). Therefore, {a mathematical formula}[A+p]KiEKiEp is true in {a mathematical formula}(M,s), whereas it is false in {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′): the logic with {a mathematical formula}KiE and with modalities for awareness change is more expressive than the logic with only the {a mathematical formula}KiE modality, wherein we cannot distinguish {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′).</paragraph><paragraph>Overview  In Section 2 we present the well-known epistemic awareness structures of [6], [28], [19], [15]; we present two notions of bisimulation for these structures, standard bisimulation and awareness bisimulation; and we present three logics for knowledge and awareness, that all contain operators {a mathematical formula}Aiφ for awareness of variables occurring in φ, but contain different epistemic operators: the logic of implicit knowledge (with {a mathematical formula}□i, so that {a mathematical formula}KiE is definable), the logic of explicit knowledge (with {a mathematical formula}KiE), and the logic of speculative knowledge (with {a mathematical formula}KiS). Speculative knowledge is knowledge modulo speculation over unaware variables [36], [37]. Section 3 motivates this novel notion of speculative knowledge. In Section 4 we then show that, on image-finite models, standard bisimilarity corresponds to modal equivalence in the logic of implicit knowledge, but that awareness bisimilarity corresponds to modal equivalence in the logic of explicit knowledge, and also to modal equivalence in the logic of speculative knowledge. Section 4.4, ‘Having the same knowledge’, applies the results on modal equivalence and bisimulation to determine when structures are the same from the perspective of an agent, or of all agents. Section 5 lists various expressivity results, including that the logic of implicit knowledge is (strictly) more expressive than the logic of explicit knowledge, and that the logic of speculative knowledge and the logic of explicit knowledge are equally expressive. Section 5 also gives the expressivity hierarchy for fragments below the three logics of implicit, explicit, and speculative knowledge, e.g., what happens if one also removes the awareness operator from them. In Section 6, we give axiomatizations for our three logics. We present an axiomatization for the logic of implicit knowledge [6], one for the logic of explicit knowledge [28], [13], [19], and an axiomatization for the logic of speculative knowledge. We distinguish axiomatizations with respect to the class of all models ({a mathematical formula}K) from those with respect to the class of models with equivalence relations and awareness introspection ({a mathematical formula}S5AI). (Axiomatizations for {a mathematical formula}KD45 models with awareness introspection, interpreting belief, are typically not greatly different from those for {a mathematical formula}S5AI, and have therefore been omitted.) For the logic with speculative knowledge, wherein the modality is a quantifier over a class of models, this is not trivial, as the axiomatization over {a mathematical formula}S5AI is not a conservative extension of the axiomatization over {a mathematical formula}K. In Section 7 we give a more detailed comparison of our results: with [6], [13] for the axiomatizations, with the lattices of spaces [19] for our notion of awareness bisimulation (the lattice of spaces corresponds to a partially ordered tree for restricted awareness bisimilarity in the model with commonly known uncertainty over all valuations), and with awareness of unawareness [16], [17] for speculative knowledge.{sup:3}</paragraph></section><section label="2"><section-title>Logics for awareness</section-title><paragraph>Throughout the contribution, given are a countable set of propositional variables P and a (disjoint) finite set of agents N.</paragraph><section label="2.1"><section-title>Structures</section-title><paragraph>An epistemic awareness model is a multi-agent Kripke model enriched with a propositional awareness function, that determines the set of propositional variables of which an agent is aware in a given state.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 3">Epistemic awareness modelAn epistemic awareness model is a tuple {a mathematical formula}M=(S,R,A,V) where</paragraph><list><list-item label="•">S (also denoted by {a mathematical formula}D(M)) is a non-empty set of states;</list-item><list-item label="•">{a mathematical formula}R:N→P(S×S) is an accessibility function;</list-item><list-item label="•">{a mathematical formula}A:N→S→P(P) is an awareness function;</list-item><list-item label="•">{a mathematical formula}V:P→P(S) is a valuation.</list-item></list><paragraph>We write {a mathematical formula}Ri for {a mathematical formula}R(i), {a mathematical formula}Ai for {a mathematical formula}A(i), and {a mathematical formula}Ri(s) or {a mathematical formula}sRi for {a mathematical formula}{t∈S|Ri(s,t)}.

Finally, the class of models with equivalence relations and satisfying awareness introspection is {a mathematical formula}S5AI.</paragraph><paragraph>We associate two notions of bisimulation [34], [3] with epistemic awareness models. Standard bisimulation is the more obvious one, but awareness bisimulation is evidently the more suitable notion in view of our introductory examples.

We achieve this by composing the agent's accessibility relation with the bisimulation relation, modulo the propositions of which the agent is unaware. The order of the epistemic accessibility relation and the bisimulation relation is important. Given a state s, in the semantics for {a mathematical formula}KiSφ we first access a possible world t and only then we compare the observably indistinguishable states, but from the agent's perspective in the source state s, not in that target state t. This mirrors the corresponding crucial aspect of awareness bisimulation, and is the accepted treatment in the awareness literature [6], [19] (although used to interpret another modality, namely that of explicit knowledge).</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 16">We recall Example 2 on page 3. Let grandmother be agent g and the car mechanic agent m. let e stand for ‘the engine is functional’, and c for ‘the control unit is functional’. We represent the causal link between a broken engine and a broken diagnostic device, i.e., the control unit, by the implication {a mathematical formula}¬e→¬c. This rules out that the engine is broken but not the control unit. ‘Grandmother is unaware of the control unit but considers it possible that the car mechanic would know about any device that is causally linked to the engine’ can now be formalized as {a mathematical formula}¬Agc∧LgSKmS(¬e→¬c). As grandmother is unaware of proposition c, this does not mean ‘the control unit in her car’ for her, but anything causally linked to her broken engine. It is a variable to speculate over, without a fixed meaning. In a realistic setting for this, we could consider the (logic of speculative knowledge for the) finite set of propositional variables representing the working state of all different functional parts of her car. We will show in Proposition 53 of the expressivity Section 5 that in class {a mathematical formula}S5AI awareness is definable from speculative knowledge,{sup:4} so that the formalization can be seen as in the language with speculative knowledge only. Various very simple two-agent and three-state {a mathematical formula}S5AI models verify the formula {a mathematical formula}¬Agc∧LSgKmS(¬e→¬c) (where we can use that modal access and awareness bisimilarity are both reflexive).</paragraph><paragraph>A good way to explain speculative knowledge is in relation to the dynamics of knowledge and awareness.

For {a mathematical formula}A+{p} we write {a mathematical formula}A+p.</paragraph><paragraph>We now illustrate speculative knowledge by way of three progressively more complex examples. The first two examples are for {a mathematical formula}S5 knowledge with awareness introspection, the class {a mathematical formula}S5AI. We therefore only need to consider awareness bisimilarity on that class of models. As said above, this affects the meaning of speculative knowledge.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 18">Fig. 4 lists all 6 different epistemic awareness models for a single agent and a single atomic proposition, for the class {a mathematical formula}S5AI. (Note that for two agents and a single atomic proposition, this number is already infinite.) If we count all pointed models, we get 8. Given awareness introspection, either the agent is aware of p in both states of the two-state models, or in neither.Obviously, all models satisfy {a mathematical formula}KiS(p∨¬p). But only {a mathematical formula}4,5,6 satisfy {a mathematical formula}KiE(p∨¬p). The agent implicitly knows p in {a mathematical formula}3,6: {a mathematical formula}□ip, but only in 6 she also speculatively knows that: {a mathematical formula}KiSp. For example, in 3 she does not speculatively know that p, i.e., {a mathematical formula}(3,s)⊭KiSp, because she is unaware of p and therefore speculatively considers all of {a mathematical formula}1,2,3. More precisely: all of {a mathematical formula}(1,s), {a mathematical formula}(1,t), {a mathematical formula}(2,s), and {a mathematical formula}(3,s) are ∅ awareness bisimilar. Because she can speculate about {a mathematical formula}(1,s) and {a mathematical formula}(2,s), wherein p is false, she cannot speculatively know that p is true. Differently said, in {a mathematical formula}(3,s) she can speculate about become aware of p and thus learn that p is true, that p is false, or that she is ignorant of the value of p: {a mathematical formula}(3,s)⊨LiS[A+p]KiSp, {a mathematical formula}(3,s)⊨LiS[A+p]KiS¬p, and {a mathematical formula}(3,s)⊨LiS[A+p]¬(KiSp∨KiS¬p). Only one of these will happen: she will know that p after becoming aware of it: {a mathematical formula}(3,s)⊨□ip∧[A+p]KiSp. But she does not know (yet): {a mathematical formula}(3,s)⊭KiS[A+p]KiSp. A validity is {a mathematical formula}□ip→[A+p]KiSp.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 19">Hans arrives at a conference, and, waking up in the morning and rubbing stardust from his sleepy eyes, he realizes what is lacking: coffee. He starts to wonder if coffee would already be served in the restaurant below. It is still fairly early. Let p stand for ‘coffee is served’, the proposition that he is uncertain about. This situation is represented by the model M in Fig. 5.Now, while on his way to the lower floor, where the restaurant is located, someone in the elevator mentions that you can't have both coffee and orange juice for breakfast. This makes Hans aware that orange juice is an issue. After this, Hans does not know whether coffee is served, and also does not know whether orange juice is served. But he knows that coffee and orange juice are not both served. We now get the situation represented in model {a mathematical formula}M′ in Fig. 5.The transition from M to {a mathematical formula}M′, by way of becoming aware of q, is all we really want, where M should be seen as a {a mathematical formula}{p} awareness bisimilarity class and {a mathematical formula}M′ as a {a mathematical formula}{p,q} awareness bisimilarity class. In terms of our framework, the relation between M and {a mathematical formula}M′ is modeled as the relation between N and {a mathematical formula}N′, with {a mathematical formula}A+q as the action relating them. Model N is merely a member of the p awareness bisimilarity class defining M. Model O is another member (when identifying the anonymous agent with i, and ignoring the other agent j). We now have, for example that {a mathematical formula}(N,s)⊨¬Aiq∧¬KiS¬(p∧q)∧[A+q](Aiq∧KiS¬(p∧q)), and that {a mathematical formula}(N,s)⊨LiS[A+q]KiS(p∧q).The action of someone in the elevator informing Hans can also be modeled as simultaneously informing and making aware, namely a so-called public announcement of {a mathematical formula}¬(p∧q) while making aware of q. For example, this ‘awareness announcement’ could have been made when Tim was also in the elevator, and when Tim, slightly more awake than Hans, was already aware of p and q and was uncertain about both. We then get the transition from O to {a mathematical formula}O′, where Hans is i and Tim is j. Let α be this action (not having given the semantics for public announcement, we stay informal here). Then we get: {a mathematical formula}(O,s)⊨KjS¬Aiq∧¬KiS¬Aiq∧[α](KjSAiq∧KiSAiq). Initially, Hans does not know that he is unaware of orange juice: just as for explicit knowledge, an agent cannot know that she is unaware of something. But Tim can know what Hans is unaware of; although Tim's personal secrets are more likely candidates for that, than orange juice at breakfast.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 20">In {a mathematical formula}KD45, beliefs may be mistaken, but you do not consider that possible: to yourself, your beliefs appear knowledge. So {a mathematical formula}LiE(¬p∧KiEp) is inconsistent. However, it is valid that an agent i considers it possible that she becomes aware of a propositional variable p that is false and that she believes to be true. That is nothing but speculating about becoming aware of false information that you had reason to accept! A validity of the language is{a mathematical formula} The interpretation of this formula is shown in Fig. 6. It is true on the model M. Let us compute it for {a mathematical formula}(M,s). Obviously, {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⊨¬Aip. Then, {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⊨LiS[A+p](¬p∧KiSp), because {a mathematical formula}(s,t)∈Ri and {a mathematical formula}(t,s)∈R[∅], and {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⊨[A+p](¬p∧KiSp). The latter holds because {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′)⊨¬p∧KiSp, as usual. The crucial aspect is that the pair {a mathematical formula}(t,s)∈R[∅] (the dashed line): agent i cannot a priori distinguish that p is true in the believed state from the speculative option that p is false but believed true. However, after becoming aware of p (in both s and t) this option is out of reach, as {a mathematical formula}(t,s)∉R[p]. The proof of the validity is not much more involved than this, but is left to the reader. More than any other example, we find speculation over false beliefs a very strong vindication for our novel notion of speculative knowledge.</paragraph><paragraph>Detailed examples of speculative knowledge are found in [37], [38]. We close this section on the motivation for this notion with some more general considerations.</paragraph><paragraph>In the presence of full awareness of all propositional variables for all agents, implicit, explicit and speculative knowledge are the same. Then, {a mathematical formula}□iφ↔KiSφ and {a mathematical formula}KiEφ↔KiSφ are valid for all φ in the logical language.</paragraph><paragraph>Compared to explicit knowledge, speculative knowledge has more logical properties associated with omnscience: unlike explicit knowledge, it satisfies necessitation: ⊨φ implies {a mathematical formula}⊨KSiφ. (See the axiomatization in Section 6.) As it involves reasoning about unaware propositional variables, {a mathematical formula}KS has maybe more reason to be called implicit knowledge than the technical primitive □. Works predating [6] such as [24] support this view. In Levesque's presentation, variables in the unaware set can be speculated over; that is exactly what in his writings is called implicit knowledge; and such considerations keep occurring in the awareness literature [28].</paragraph><paragraph>What you can do with {a mathematical formula}KS or with {a mathematical formula}KE comes fairly close. In Section 4 we show that awareness bisimulation corresponds to modal equivalence in the logic of explicit knowledge (Theorem 23), but also in the logic of speculative knowledge (Theorem 30). Ergo, two pointed models have the same information content in both logics. Also, in Section 5 we show (and this is another, independent, result) that the logic of speculative knowledge is as expressive as the logic of explicit knowledge (Proposition 43).</paragraph><paragraph>We therefore hope that speculative knowledge may have some appeal to the community as an epistemic notion of independent interest.</paragraph><paragraph>As speculative knowledge treats unaware atoms as their most general consistent interpretation, there is no semantic difference (with respect to just speculative knowledge) between an agent being unaware of an atom and an agent (speculative) knowing nothing about an atom. In fact we have seen this in Example 18: models {a mathematical formula}2,3,4 are indistinguishable in their speculative properties; for example, all speculatively consider it possible that p is false and that it is true. In general, this point is much harder to make, because a single state wherein the agent is unaware of p has then to be compared with the infinity of higher-order multi-agent uncertainty about p: see Section 5.4 on other expressivity results.</paragraph></section><section label="4"><section-title>Bisimulation and modal equivalence</section-title><paragraph>We show that standard bisimulation corresponds to modal equivalence in the logic of implicit knowledge, and that awareness bisimulation corresponds to modal equivalence in the logics of explicit and speculative knowledge.

In this formulation it is important that φ is chosen before Q, and both φ and Q before the models, so that the inductive hypothesis may be used on a subformula of φ for another subset of P than the initial Q (and for any pair of models). The proof goes by induction on φ; all cases are trivial except {a mathematical formula}KiEφ.Case{a mathematical formula}KiE Assume {a mathematical formula}(M,s)↔_Q(M′,s′), and suppose that {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⊨KiEφ with {a mathematical formula}v(KiEφ)⊆Q (which implies {a mathematical formula}v(φ)⊆Q).

Hence, for any {a mathematical formula}Q⊆Q′, {a mathematical formula}(M,t)⊨∀Qφ′. We established {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⊨(KiSφ)′.Conversely, suppose that {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⊨(KiSφ)′, i.e., for every {a mathematical formula}Q⊆v(φ)\Ai(s), for every {a mathematical formula}t∈sRi, {a mathematical formula}(M,t)⊨∀Qφ′. Now suppose for contradiction that {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⊭KiSφ. Then there must be some {a mathematical formula}t∈sRi and {a mathematical formula}(N,u)↔_Ai(s)(M,t) such that {a mathematical formula}(N,u)⊭φ. By the induction hypothesis, it follows that {a mathematical formula}(N,u)⊭φ′. The remainder of this proof consists of finding a contradiction with {a mathematical formula}(N,u)⊭φ′. To do this we build a model from the awareness bisimulation between {a mathematical formula}(N,u) and {a mathematical formula}(M,t) such that the model must both satisfy and refute {a mathematical formula}φ′, giving the required contradiction.From now on, let {a mathematical formula}(N,u), {a mathematical formula}(M,t) and {a mathematical formula}Q=v(φ)\Ai(s) be fixed. From M and N we construct a new model K where:<list>{a mathematical formula}SK⊆SM×SN×℘(P) is the set of triples {a mathematical formula}(t′,u′,X) where {a mathematical formula}(M,t′)↔_X(N,u′);{a mathematical formula}(t′,u′,X)RiK(t″,u″,X′) iff {a mathematical formula}t′RiMt″, {a mathematical formula}u′RiNu″ and {a mathematical formula}X′=X∩AiM(t′);{a mathematical formula}AiK((t′,u′,X))=AiM(t′)\Q∪(AiN(u′)∩Q);{a mathematical formula}∀p∉Q,(t′,u′,Q)∈VK(p) iff {a mathematical formula}t′∈VM(p), and {a mathematical formula}∀p∈Q,(t′,u′,Q)∈VK(p) iff {a mathematical formula}u′∈VN(p).To show the first fact, consider any </list><paragraph>{a mathematical formula}(t′,u′,X)∈SK. Define {a mathematical formula}R on {a mathematical formula}SK×SM as {a mathematical formula}((t′,u′,X),y)∈R if and only if {a mathematical formula}t′=y. This defines a {a mathematical formula}P∖Q standard bisimulation. The clause atoms is satisfied because {a mathematical formula}∀p∉Q,(t′,u′,X)∈VK(p) iff {a mathematical formula}t′∈VM(p). The clause aware is satisfied because {a mathematical formula}AiK(t′,u′,X)=AiM(t′)\Q′. The clause forth is satisfied because for {a mathematical formula}(t″,u″,X′) such that {a mathematical formula}(t′,u′,X)RiK(t″,u″,X′), we have {a mathematical formula}((t″,u″,X′),y)∈R exactly when {a mathematical formula}t″=y; back is similar to forth.To show the second fact, consider any {a mathematical formula}(t′,u′,X)∈SK. For every {a mathematical formula}X⊆P, we already have {a mathematical formula}(M,t′)↔_X(N,u′) and we define {a mathematical formula}R[X∪Q]⊆SK×SN such that {a mathematical formula}((t′,u′,X),u′)∈R[X∪Q]. The family of relations {a mathematical formula}R[X∪Q] defines an {a mathematical formula}X∪Q awareness bisimulation: The clause atoms is satisfied because {a mathematical formula}∀p∈Q,(t′,u′,X)∈VK(p) iff {a mathematical formula}u′∈VN(p), and {a mathematical formula}∀p∈X,(t′,u′,X)∈VK(p) iff {a mathematical formula}t′∈VM(p), where {a mathematical formula}(M,t′)↔_X(N,u′), so by the atoms clause, we have {a mathematical formula}u′∈VN(p); The clause aware is satisfied because {a mathematical formula}AiK((t′,u′,X))=(AiN(u′)∩Q)∪(AiM(t′)\Q), and since {a mathematical formula}(M,t′)↔_X(N,u′), we have {a mathematical formula}ANi(u′)∩X=AiM(t′)∩X, so {a mathematical formula}AKi((t′,u′,X))∩(X∪Q)=(AiN(u′)∩Q)∪(AiN(u′)∩X)=AiN(u′)∩(X∪Q); The clause forth is satisfied because given {a mathematical formula}((t′,u′,X),u′)∈R[X], for any {a mathematical formula}(t″,u″,X′)∈(t′,u′,X)RiK, we have {a mathematical formula}u″ such that {a mathematical formula}u″∈u′RiN and {a mathematical formula}((t″,u″,X′),u″)∈R[X′], where we use that {a mathematical formula}X′=X∩AMi(t′) so that also (as above, within the X range) {a mathematical formula}X′=X∩AiN(u′), as required for forth; The clause back is satisfied in a similar way to the clause forth.Now that we have established these two facts we note that from the first fact we have {a mathematical formula}(K,(t,u,AiM(s)))⊨φ′, since {a mathematical formula}(M,t)⊨∀Qφ′ and {a mathematical formula}(K,(t,u,AMi(s)))≃P\Q(M,t), and from the second we have {a mathematical formula}(K,(t,u,AiM(s)))⊨¬φ′, through Proposition 28, noting {a mathematical formula}(N,u)⊨¬φ′ and {a mathematical formula}(K,(t,u,AiM(s)))↔_v(φ)(N,u).Finally, we note that whilst the translation we have given is from {a mathematical formula}L(KS,A) into {a mathematical formula}L(□,A), it is semantically equivalent to a translation into {a mathematical formula}L(KE,A) since every {a mathematical formula}□i operator is only ever applied to formulas containing atoms of which agent i is aware.

Clearly the propositional language {a mathematical formula}L() is less expressive than all of {a mathematical formula}L(A), {a mathematical formula}L(KE), {a mathematical formula}L(□), and {a mathematical formula}L(KS).

However, they are modally equivalent in the logic with language {a mathematical formula}L(KS). This can be shown by a straightforward inductive argument: ⊤ and p are true in both points (and, not drawn in the figure, w.l.o.g. we may assume that they also correspond on the value of all other propositional variables), conjunction and negation are trivial, and, as there are no accessible states, any formula {a mathematical formula}KiSφ is also true in both. □</paragraph><paragraph>In the proof of this proposition we only considered a single propositional variable and a single agent (that is therefore unlabeled in the figure), but for modal equivalence we of course need to consider all of the countably infinite set of variables and all agents.

Therefore {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⊨KiSp.Otherwise, suppose there is a {a mathematical formula}t∈sRi such that {a mathematical formula}t∉V(p). (This part of the proof is illustrated by Fig. 10.) Let now {a mathematical formula}u∈sRi be arbitrary and {a mathematical formula}(M,u)↔_Ai(s)(M′,u′).

For example, the language {a mathematical formula}L(LE) is strictly less expressive than {a mathematical formula}L(KE): awareness is definable in {a mathematical formula}L(KE), but not in {a mathematical formula}L(LE). Consider the case of models without accessibility, but wherein the agent is aware of p in one and unaware of p in the other. The formula {a mathematical formula}Aip distinguishes them. But with an empty accessibility relation they are modally equivalent in {a mathematical formula}L(LE). Also in that case, moving to the class {a mathematical formula}S5AI further changes the hierarchy: in {a mathematical formula}S5AI awareness is definable in {a mathematical formula}L(LE), namely as {a mathematical formula}LiE(φ∨¬φ); {a mathematical formula}L(LE) and {a mathematical formula}L(KE) are equally expressive in the class {a mathematical formula}S5AI. Additional expressivity results involving {a mathematical formula}LE as a modal primitive, and yet other surprising results, involving dynamics, are found in [42], [43].</paragraph><paragraph>Awareness and speculative knowledge  Recalling {a mathematical formula}L(KS)≺L(KS,A) (Proposition 48) and {a mathematical formula}L(KS)∼S5AIL(KS,A) (Proposition 53) it is of clear interest to observe that {a mathematical formula}L(KS)≺S5L(KS,A): without awareness introspection but still in class {a mathematical formula}S5, awareness is also undefinable from speculative knowledge. On the class {a mathematical formula}S5 this result is much harder to obtain than on the class {a mathematical formula}K, where a pointed model with an empty accessibility relation for agent i trivially satisfies all formulas of shape {a mathematical formula}KiSφ (see the proof of Proposition 48). The proof on class {a mathematical formula}S5 employs a countable sequence of arbitrarily large finite pointed models (formalizing arbitrarily complex higher-order uncertainty), and the observation that unawareness of a single variable p is indistinguishable from awareness of p in the presence of arbitrary higher-order uncertainty about the value of that atomic proposition. (In other words, all the ‘speculation’ that the agent can do if she is unaware of p, given the nature of the speculative knowledge operator {a mathematical formula}KS, is actually present in the — very large — model wherein she is aware of p.) As we restrict ourselves to the class {a mathematical formula}S5AI we have kept the (lengthy) proof of this result outside this work.</paragraph><paragraph>Belief  The expressivity results for the class {a mathematical formula}S5AI of equivalence relations and awareness introspection, i.e., for notions of knowledge, remain unchanged for the class {a mathematical formula}KD45 of transitive, euclidean and serial relations, with in addition awareness introspection, i.e., for notions of (consistent) belief. This can be easily seen from the proofs of our results for knowledge. The proof of Proposition 52 that {a mathematical formula}LE∼S5AILS uses that (the product relation) {a mathematical formula}RiK is an equivalence relation because (its constituents) {a mathematical formula}RiM and {a mathematical formula}RiN are equivalence relations. Similarly, we have that {a mathematical formula}RiK is transitive, euclidean, and serial, because {a mathematical formula}RiM and {a mathematical formula}RiN are transitive, euclidean, and serial. The proof of Proposition 53 that {a mathematical formula}L(KS)∼S5AIL(KS,A) uses the Modica–Rustichini-like definition of awareness as {a mathematical formula}Aiφ=⋀p∈v(φ)(KiSp∨KiS¬KiSp): this also works for {a mathematical formula}KD45 with awareness introspection. The proof does not require that the arbitrary {a mathematical formula}t∈sRi may be equal to s: the same proof therefore works for {a mathematical formula}KD45 with awareness introspection. (As for knowledge, awareness introspection is crucial.) The incomparability arguments for {a mathematical formula}S5AI expressivity use models with equivalence relations. Those are included in class {a mathematical formula}KD45, so they also serve to demonstrate incomparability in {a mathematical formula}KD45. We conclude that expressivity hierarchy for {a mathematical formula}S5AI in Fig. 8 remains unchanged for {a mathematical formula}KD45 with awareness introspection: the results for belief are the same as for knowledge.</paragraph><paragraph>Dynamics of awareness  If we also take dynamics into account, the expressivity picture changes again. As we have already seen in the introduction, adding a dynamic modality for ‘becoming aware’ to the logic makes the logic more expressive. Consider the introductory examples of Fig. 1 (page 4) and Fig. 3 (page 5). For the semantics of ‘becoming aware’, recall Definition 17 (page 9). The models {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′) of Fig. 1 are awareness bisimilar and modally equivalent in the logic of explicit knowledge. But they can be distinguished in the logic of implicit knowledge: a distinguishing formula in the logic of implicit knowledge is {a mathematical formula}KiE□ip. The models {a mathematical formula}(M+p,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M+p′,s′) of Fig. 3 describe the situation after the agent becomes aware of p in both models. These resulting models can be distinguished by {a mathematical formula}KiEKiEp: it is true in {a mathematical formula}(M+p,s) but false in {a mathematical formula}(M+p′,s′). Therefore, {a mathematical formula}[A+p]KiEKiEp is true in {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and false in {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′). In the introduction this was informal, but with Definition 17 we can now validate this result. The dynamic logic of explicit knowledge, that contains action modalities {a mathematical formula}[A+p], is therefore more expressive than the logic of explicit knowledge.</paragraph><paragraph>The expressivity of dynamic versions of the logics is addressed in [40]. The result is that the dynamic versions of the logics of implicit, explicit, and speculative knowledge are all equally expressive, and also as expressive as the (non-dynamic) logic of implicit knowledge. In view of the above example, this will not come as a surprise. This proof uses that the □ operator is definable in {a mathematical formula}LE (or, similarly, in {a mathematical formula}LS),{sup:7} and that adding the dynamic modality does not add the expressivity of the logic of implicit knowledge (with language {a mathematical formula}L□). The equal expressivity of the dynamic and the non-dynamic version of the logic of implicit knowledge is a consequence of (complete) axiomatization of that logic, wherein the interaction of dynamic modalities with the other logical connectives can be described in axioms that are equivalences, thus pushing the dynamic operator deeper into a given formula. In [40], this interaction is spelled out for modalities for action models, a more general notion of epistemic awareness action of which {a mathematical formula}A+v(φ) is merely an example. An instantiation of the reduction of awareness after actions is that {a mathematical formula}[A+p]Aiφ↔Aiφ[⊤∖p], so that, for example, {a mathematical formula}[A+p]Aip is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}Ai⊤, i.e., to ⊤, whereas for {a mathematical formula}q≠p, {a mathematical formula}[A+p]Aiq is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}Aiq.

The axiom AI is a description of positive awareness introspection. If {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⊨Aiψ then for all {a mathematical formula}t∈sRiM we have {a mathematical formula}(M,t)⊨Aiφ. By the aware clause of awareness bisimulation (Definition 6), for all {a mathematical formula}(N,u) where {a mathematical formula}(N,u)↔_AiM(s)(M,t), we must have {a mathematical formula}(N,u)⊨Aiφ. The axiom T holds since {a mathematical formula}(M,s)↔_AiM(s)(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}s∈sRiM. The axiom 5 holds since if {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⊨¬KiSφ∧Aiφ, then there is some {a mathematical formula}t∈sRM, and some pointed awareness model {a mathematical formula}(N,u)↔_AiM(s)(M,t) such that {a mathematical formula}(N,u)⊭φ. Let {a mathematical formula}(N′,v) be any model such that for some {a mathematical formula}t′∈sRiM, {a mathematical formula}(N′,v)↔_AiM(s)(M,t′). We note that by awareness introspection, we will have {a mathematical formula}(M,t′)⊨Aiφ, and by the aware clause of Definition 6, we will have {a mathematical formula}(N′,v)⊨Aiφ. As M is an S5 awareness model, it must be that {a mathematical formula}t∈t′RiM. Therefore, there is some {a mathematical formula}v′∈vRiN′ such that {a mathematical formula}v′↔_AiM(s)∩AiN′(v)t. By the transitivity of bisimulation, we must also have {a mathematical formula}v′↔_AiM(s)∩AiN′(v)u, and since {a mathematical formula}v(φ)⊆AiM(s)∩AiN′(v) we have {a mathematical formula}(N,u)⊨φ if and only if {a mathematical formula}(N′,v′)⊨φ.

They have since then been used in many other works, such as, for example, [19]. In [6] the model class considered is {a mathematical formula}KD45: accessibility relations that are serial, transitive and euclidean, plus awareness introspection. Whereas [19] assume multi-{a mathematical formula}S5 epistemic accessibility plus awareness introspection — a class more common among economists. This is our class {a mathematical formula}S5AI. We also have results for multi-{a mathematical formula}K, as this choice facilitates some theoretical results, such as the proof of decidability in [37], the proof of {a mathematical formula}L(KS)≺L(KS,A) (Proposition 48); more in general: the surprisingly different expressivity hierarchies for classes {a mathematical formula}K and {a mathematical formula}S5AI.</paragraph><paragraph>Awareness bisimulation and the complete lattice of spaces  Awareness bisimulation is special in that it is defined as a function from sets of variables to binary relations, and not as a binary relation. In that sense our solution is novel, to our knowledge, and we do not know of a similar bisimulation (also not in a setting other than awareness). Apart from that, our approach is related to and motivated by the complete lattice of spaces in [19]. We consider it a generalization of that approach. From any epistemic awareness model we are able to derive a complete lattice of spaces via awareness bisimulation, whereas in [19] this structure is given explicitly. In other words, we have a succinct, technical tool to derive that result.</paragraph><paragraph>We demonstrate the relation between the two approaches by considering Fig. 2 in [19, p. 86], shown here as Fig. 11. This figure represents the different ways in which an agent can be uncertain about or unaware of two propositional variables p and q, or a subset of those. In the figure, j stands for ‘knowing whether’ (for example, jp stands for ‘the agent knows whether p’, i.e., the agent knows that p or the agent knows that ¬p) and u stands for ‘unaware of’ (for example, uq stands for ‘the agent is unaware of q’). The four squares represent the ways of uncertainty and unawareness for, respectively, {a mathematical formula}{p,q}, {a mathematical formula}{p}, {a mathematical formula}{q}, and ∅. A circle or oval represents an equivalence class of for the agent epistemically indistinguishable states (in [19] this is called a possibility). Those in the lower squares are connected by curved lines to two or four non-circled points in a higher square. This means that those two or four points are an equivalence class of for the agent indistinguishable states, in view of the agent's knowledge and awareness, i.e., in our terms, an equivalence class of awareness bisimilar points. The (point in the) circle from which these lines go up should be seen as the identification of such awareness bisimilar points, in terms more familiar to logicians, the result of bisimulation contraction (it is the quotient of the upper structure with respect to that equivalence).</paragraph><paragraph>For example, consider the two possibilities in row {a mathematical formula}jp,uq and columns {a mathematical formula}p,q and {a mathematical formula}p,¬q in {a mathematical formula}S{p,q}. They are both linked to the single possibility in row jp and column p in {a mathematical formula}S{p}. We would say that the former are p awareness bisimilar and that the latter represents that {a mathematical formula}R[p]-equivalence class: if the agent is unaware of q, it is compatible with this level of awareness that q is true but also that q is false. Similarly, in this figure, the single possibility ∅ represents the {a mathematical formula}R[∅]-equivalence class of the four possibilities in the bottom row of {a mathematical formula}S{p,q}, and, if there were only one atom in the language, the {a mathematical formula}R[∅]-equivalence class of the two possibilities in the bottom row of {a mathematical formula}S{p}. And so on. The (in their terms) projections between the squares correspond to, in our terms, the partial order induced by restricted awareness bisimilarity.</paragraph><paragraph>Now compare Fig. 11 to Fig. 5. The model M is the p awareness bisimilarity contraction of the model {a mathematical formula}M′ (or, if you wish, of {a mathematical formula}N′). This almost resembles the relation between, respectively, the row {a mathematical formula}¬jp in {a mathematical formula}S{p} and the row {a mathematical formula}¬jp,uq in {a mathematical formula}S{p,q}, except that row {a mathematical formula}¬jp,uq has one more state than {a mathematical formula}M′, namely for the valuation where p and q are both true. The similarity is not accidental. On purpose we have taken the same variables and a single agent, exactly as in [19]. The difference is also not accidental. Our model {a mathematical formula}M′ represents uncertainty over three valuations. But in Fig. 11 from [19] there is no oval connecting these three valuations. Indeed, they only consider uncertainty about single variables from a given set of variables, but not uncertainty about any subset of valuations of those variables. (A similar restriction holds when there is more than one agent.) Given a set of propositional variables, we consider awareness bisimilarity of points in any epistemic awareness model for those variables (or between any two pointed epistemic awareness models), whereas [19] only consider awareness bisimilarity in this particular model.</paragraph><paragraph>Expressivity  The language used in [6] is {a mathematical formula}L(□,KE,A), but it has the same expressivity as {a mathematical formula}L(□,A), since {a mathematical formula}KiEφ is definable as {a mathematical formula}□iφ∧Aiφ (see Proposition 38). The language {a mathematical formula}L(KE) is shown in [13] to have the same expressivity as {a mathematical formula}L(KE,A) but, just like in [6], with the difference that this is on {a mathematical formula}KD45 models with awareness introspection. In such models awareness can be defined in terms of explicit knowledge (as also done in [28]) as {a mathematical formula}Aφ↔(KEφ∨KE¬KEφ). In a setting like [6], only {a mathematical formula}Aφ↔KE(φ∨¬φ) holds. We recall (see the proof of Proposition 53) that on {a mathematical formula}S5AI, awareness is not definable as {a mathematical formula}Aiφ↔(KiSφ∨KiS¬KSiφ) in the logic of speculative knowledge, but has to be defined as {a mathematical formula}Aiφ↔⋀p∈v(φ)(KiSp∨KiS¬KiSp).</paragraph><paragraph>Although the above works therefore contain many expressivity results, expressivity as such was not their focus (but axiomatization). We therefore think that the details on the expressivity hierarchies under different frame conditions have advanced the area.</paragraph><paragraph>Axiomatization  In [6], Fagin and Halpern present (among many, many, other results) the axiomatization for the logic or propositional awareness with language {a mathematical formula}L(□,KE,A), on the class {a mathematical formula}KD45, and with awareness introspection (with awareness {a mathematical formula}Aip defined by abbreviation as {a mathematical formula}KiE(p∨¬p)). Whereas in [13], Halpern presents axiomatizations for the logics with languages {a mathematical formula}L(□,A), {a mathematical formula}L(KE,A) and {a mathematical formula}L(KE), for the same model class. We also present an axiomatization for the model class {a mathematical formula}K.</paragraph><paragraph>A crucial role in all these axiomatizations is the interaction of knowledge and awareness. Given awareness introspection ({a mathematical formula}t∈Ri(s) implies {a mathematical formula}Ai(s)=Ai(t)), in the axiomatization for {a mathematical formula}L(□,A) we find this as {a mathematical formula}Aiφ→□iAiφ and {a mathematical formula}¬Aiφ→□i¬Aiφ. But because an agent cannot explicitly know that she is unaware of something, in the axiomatization for {a mathematical formula}L(KE,A) this property is, instead, described by an axiom {a mathematical formula}Aiφ→KiEAiφ and a rule Irr.: “If no propositional variables in φ appear in ψ, then from {a mathematical formula}¬Aiφ→ψ infer ψ”. In [13] it is suggested that the rule Irr. might be derivable from the axiomatization, and in [15, p. 241, footnote 7] it was then indeed shown to be derivable.</paragraph><paragraph>Without these additional features, i.e., on model class {a mathematical formula}K, the results are easier to obtain. This may explain that the completeness proof for the logic of explicit knowledge in [13] is more involved than ours in Subsection 6.1. Of course a good reason not to consider multi-{a mathematical formula}K as a separate case of interest, is that modal accessibility then does not represent an epistemic notion.</paragraph><paragraph>The axiomatizations (over {a mathematical formula}K and over {a mathematical formula}S5AI) for speculative knowledge are novel, and compare interestingly to the axiomatizations for explicit knowledge. Different from those, they satisfy necessitation for knowledge, and the interaction of unawareness and knowledge is also different. On the other hand, just as the explicit knowledge axiomatizations, they are decidable. This follows from their embedding into bisimulation quantified modal logic, that is decidable. The embedding is discussed in the passage on uniform interpolation just before Lemma 42, on page 16.</paragraph><paragraph>Awareness of unawareness  We now compare the logic of speculative knowledge with the quantified logic of awareness and knowledge of [16] (and [17]) for the special case of awareness generated by propositional variables. We recall that speculative knowledge is interpreted by the composition of modal accessibility and bisimulation quantification. In [38] these are separate primitives in the logical language, so that {a mathematical formula}KiSφ is definable namely as {a mathematical formula}□i∀Qφ,{sup:8} where {a mathematical formula}Q=Ai(s)∩v(φ); in other words, speculative knowledge incorporates (universal) bisimulation quantification over the set of propositional variables occurring in φ of which the agent is unaware (see [38, p. 181]). Similarly, {a mathematical formula}LiSφ abbreviates {a mathematical formula}◇i∃Qφ. Now Halpern and Rêgo also have explicit quantification. However, they: (i) distinguish a disjoint set of propositional variables P from the set of quantifier variables X (partly motivated by the generality of their framework for syntax-based awareness), {a mathematical formula}(ii) quantify over the denotation of variables in a given domain (so these are not bisimulation quantifiers), and {a mathematical formula}(iii) only allow quantification over quantifier-free formulas; whereas we: (i) quantify over propositional variables P, {a mathematical formula}(ii) have bisimulation quantifiers (that quantify over the denotation of variables in the domain of any bisimilar model to the current model), and {a mathematical formula}(iii) allow quantification over any formula, including those containing quantifiers. Tellingly, our logic is decidable (see previous paragraph), which is common for bisimulation quantified logics, whereas theirs is undecidable [16, p. 509], which is common for first-order logics with domain quantifiers.</paragraph><paragraph>Here is another difference with [16]. Let agent i be aware of p and not of q. Then she is not aware of formula {a mathematical formula}KiS(p∧q). Similarly, in [38], using the definability given above, the agent is then unaware of {a mathematical formula}□i∀q(p∧q). However, in [16], now reading q as a quantifier variable, the agent is aware of {a mathematical formula}□i∀q(p∧q), as only free variables count, not bound variables. This different definition of awareness makes sense in their setting, but not in ours: otherwise, an agent i would be aware of {a mathematical formula}KiSφ for all φ (see Footnote 6). Speculative knowledge of unawareness is awareness (in that other sense) of unawareness.</paragraph><paragraph>We conjecture that the quantified logic of implicit knowledge of [16] is (strictly) more expressive than the logic of implicit knowledge (and similarly for the addition of quantifiers to the logic with only explicit knowledge). This would not be surprising: this seems their goal. Whereas our goal was to propose a logic, namely the logic of speculative knowledge, that is as expressive as the logic of explicit knowledge. We succeeded in this purpose by (severely) restricting quantification, namely to the above {a mathematical formula}□i∀Qφ pattern. The language of [38], wherein no such restriction exists, may also be more expressive. Now turn this question around: consider the fragment of the logical language of [16] wherein quantification is restricted to patterns {a mathematical formula}□i∀Qφ (modulo renaming propositional variables to quantifier variables). Now, of course, Q is not induced by the actual state, so φ may contain unaware propositional variables that are not bound. Is this fragment an interesting logic? Is it as expressive as the logic of implicit knowledge?</paragraph></section><section label="8"><section-title>Conclusions and further research</section-title><paragraph>We have the described the logics of implicit, explicit, and speculative knowledge, related modal equivalence in these logics to different forms of bisimulation, compared their expressivity, and provided sound and complete axiomatizations. A follow-up study under preparation will focus on the dynamic aspects that have been left out of this investigation.</paragraph><paragraph>We have various conjectures on the complexity of our logics, but we also leave this for future research. For example, the embedding of the logic of speculative knowledge into bisimulation quantified logic not only shows that it is decidable but also gives a non-elementary upper bound of complexity. The lower bound is unclear. As multi-agent logics of knowledge go, it is certainly PSPACE-hard. However, the actual complexity may well be non-elementary k−EXP in the knowledge depth. If that is the case, then, given that speculative knowledge operators are bisimulation quantifiers, the complexity of model checking may unfortunately also be non-elementary.</paragraph><section-title>Acknowledgements</section-title></section></content><acknowledgements><paragraph>Hans van Ditmarsch is also affiliated to IMSc, Chennai, as a research associate.
