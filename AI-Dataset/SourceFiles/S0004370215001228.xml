Loosely speaking, axiom (P) states that if a belief set K can be divided into two disjoint compartments, and the new information ϕ relates only to the first compartment, then the second compartment should not be effected by the revision of K by ϕ. Using the well-known connection between AGM revision functions and preorders on possible worlds as our starting point, we formulate additional constraints on such preorders that characterise precisely Parikh's axiom (P). Interestingly, the additional constraints essentially generalise a criterion of plausibility between possible worlds that predates axiom (P). A by-product of our study is the identification of two possible readings of Parikh's axiom (P), which we call the strong and the weak versions of the axiom. Regarding specific operators, we show that Dalal's belief revision operator satisfies both weak and strong (P), and it is therefore relevance-sensitive.</abstract><keywords>Belief revision;Possible-world semantics;Knowledge representation</keywords><content><section label="1"><section-title>Introduction</section-title><paragraph>Research in the area of Belief Revision examines the dynamics of belief sets. Much of the work in the field is based on the classical work of Alchourrón, Gärdenfors and Makinson, [1], that has given rise to a formal framework for studying this process, commonly referred to as the AGM paradigm, [15]. Within the AGM paradigm there are two constituents that are of particular interest for this article. The first is the set of rationality postulates for belief revision, known as the AGM postulates[1]. The second is a special kind of preorders on possible worlds, called faithful preorders, through which belief revision functions can be constructed. Katsuno and Mendelzon have shown, [9], that the revision functions constructed from faithful preorders are precisely those satisfying the AGM postulates.</paragraph><paragraph>The AGM postulates have been widely accepted as sound constraints for rational revision functions. There are however credible doubts about their completeness. For example, it is well-known that the AGM postulates do not suffice to address the case of iterated revision (see [16] for a recent survey).</paragraph><paragraph>Another weakness identified more recently by Parikh is that the AGM postulates for revision are rather liberal in their treatment of the notion of relevance. More precisely, Parikh argues that during belief revision a rational agent does not change her entire belief corpus, but only the portion of it that is relevant to the new information. This intuition of local change, Parikh claims, is not fully captured by the AGM postulates. To remedy this shortcoming, Parikh introduced an additional axiom named (P). Loosely speaking, axiom (P) says that when new information ϕ is received, only part of the initial belief set K will be affected, namely the part that shares common propositional variables with the minimal language of ϕ. Parikh's approach is also known as the language splitting model.</paragraph><paragraph>Although axiom (P) is just a first step towards capturing the role of relevance in belief revision, Parikh's work has received considerable attention since the publication of [11] (see for example [3], [4], [5], [10]). Yet, despite all the research on axiom (P), no semantics for it have been formulated. Perhaps more importantly, it is not even known if axiom (P) is consistent with the AGM postulates. This is the gap that the present article aims to fill. We examine new constraints on faithful preorders and, building on Katsuno and Mendelzon's result, we prove that in the presence of the AGM postulates, axiom (P) is necessary and sufficient with respect to these new semantic constraints. Moreover we prove that, contrary to what Parikh conjectured in [11], axiom (P) is consistent with the full set of AGM postulates for revision.</paragraph><paragraph>What is particularly pleasing about our result is that the new constraints on faithful preorders are in fact not new at all; they essentially generalise a very natural condition that predates axiom (P) and has been motivated independently by other authors, like Borgida [2], Dalal [6], Satoh [17], and Winslett [18].</paragraph><paragraph>In course of formulating semantics for axiom (P) we observe that there are in fact two possible readings of this axiom, which we call the strong and the weak versions of (P). We present both these versions and show that strong (P) brings with it a new feature in the picture of classical AGM revision: it makes associations between the revision policies of different theories.</paragraph><paragraph>Using our semantic characterisation, we prove that Dalal's revision operator satisfies strong (P).{sup:1} An immediate consequence of this result is that strong (P) is consistent with the full set of the AGM postulates for revision.</paragraph><paragraph>The outline of the paper is as follows. We first present some background material on the AGM paradigm and the language splitting model (first three sections). The crucial axiom (P) is then examined in greater detail to fully flesh out its possible readings (Section 5). We then proceed with the formulation of semantics for weak (P) and strong (P). For ease of exposition and clarity, we start by focusing on the special case of “opinionated” agents, that is, agents whose belief set is a consistent complete theory (Section 6). In Section 7 we consider the general case of incomplete theories. Section 8 examines Dalal's operator against axiom (P). The last section contains some concluding remarks.</paragraph></section><section label="2"><section-title>Formal preliminaries</section-title><paragraph>Throughout this paper we work with a finite set of propositional variables P. We define L to be the propositional language generated from P (using the standard Boolean connectives {a mathematical formula}∧,∨,→,↔,¬ and the special symbol ⊥) and governed by classical propositional logic. For any subset of {a mathematical formula}Q⊆P, by {a mathematical formula}Q± we denote the set containing all literals induced by Q, i.e. {a mathematical formula}Q±=Q∪{¬p:p∈Q}.</paragraph><paragraph>A sentence {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈L is contingent iff ⊭ϕ and {a mathematical formula}⊭¬ϕ. For a set of sentences Γ of L, we denote by {a mathematical formula}Cn(Γ) the set of all logical consequences of Γ, i.e., {a mathematical formula}Cn(Γ)={ϕ∈L:Γ⊨ϕ}. We shall often write {a mathematical formula}Cn(ϕ1,ϕ2,…,ϕn), for sentences {a mathematical formula}ϕ1, {a mathematical formula}ϕ2,…,ϕn, as an abbreviation of {a mathematical formula}Cn({ϕ1,ϕ2,…,ϕn}). For any two sentences {a mathematical formula}ϕ,ψ we shall write {a mathematical formula}ϕ≡ψ iff {a mathematical formula}Cn(ϕ)=Cn(ψ).</paragraph><paragraph>A theory K of L is any set of sentences of L closed under ⊨, i.e., {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(K). We denote the set of all consistent theories of L by {a mathematical formula}T. We define a possible world r (or simply a world), to be a consistent set of literals such that for any propositional variables {a mathematical formula}p∈P, either {a mathematical formula}p∈r or {a mathematical formula}¬p∈r. We will often identify a world r with the conjunction of its literals, leaving it to the context to resolve any ambiguity (for example in “¬r”, r is a sentence, whereas in “{a mathematical formula}r∩{x}”, r is a set of literals). We denote the set of all possible worlds by {a mathematical formula}M. For a set of sentences Γ of L, {a mathematical formula}[Γ] denotes the set of all possible worlds that entail Γ; i.e. {a mathematical formula}[Γ]={r∈M:r⊨Γ}. Often we use the notation {a mathematical formula}[ϕ] for a sentence {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈L, as an abbreviation of {a mathematical formula}[{ϕ}]. For a theory K and a set of sentences Γ of L, we denote by {a mathematical formula}K+Γ the closure under ⊨ of {a mathematical formula}K∪Γ, i.e., {a mathematical formula}K+Γ=Cn(K∪Γ). For a sentence {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈L we often write {a mathematical formula}K+ϕ as an abbreviation of {a mathematical formula}K+{ϕ}. For a set of worlds {a mathematical formula}V⊆M, by {a mathematical formula}t(V) we denote the set of sentences satisfied by all worlds in V; i.e. {a mathematical formula}t(V)={ϕ∈L:r⊨ϕ, for all {a mathematical formula}r∈V}. If {a mathematical formula}V=⌀, then we define {a mathematical formula}t(V)=L. It is not hard to see that {a mathematical formula}t(V) is always a theory.</paragraph><paragraph>In the course of this paper, we often consider sublanguages of L. Let Q be a subset of the set of variables in P. By {a mathematical formula}LQ we denote the sublanguage of L defined over Q. In the limiting case where Q is empty, we take {a mathematical formula}LQ to be the language generated by ⊥ and the Boolean connectives. For a sentence χ of L, by {a mathematical formula}Lχ we denote the minimal sublanguage of L within which χ can be expressed (i.e., {a mathematical formula}Lχ contains a sentence that is logically equivalent to χ, and moreover no proper sublanguage of {a mathematical formula}Lχ contains such a sentence). If χ is inconsistent, we take {a mathematical formula}Lχ to be {a mathematical formula}L∅.{sup:2} Moreover, by {a mathematical formula}Pχ we denote the propositional variables in the minimal language of χ.</paragraph><paragraph>By {a mathematical formula}Lχ‾ we denote the language {a mathematical formula}LP−Pχ. Notice that since we have assumed that P is finite, for any theory K there is a sentence {a mathematical formula}χ∈L such that {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(χ). Hence we can define {a mathematical formula}LK, {a mathematical formula}PK, and {a mathematical formula}LK‾, as {a mathematical formula}Lχ, {a mathematical formula}Pχ, and {a mathematical formula}Lχ‾ respectively, for a {a mathematical formula}χ∈L such that {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(χ) (the choice of χ is irrelevant; any χ that is logically equivalent to K gives the same results).</paragraph><paragraph>In the forthcoming discussion, we shall often project operations defined above for the entire language L, to one of its sublanguages {a mathematical formula}L′. When this happens, all notation will be subscripted by the sublanguage {a mathematical formula}L′. For example, for a set of sentences Γ, the term {a mathematical formula}CnL′(Γ) denotes the logical closure of Γ in{a mathematical formula}L′; i.e. {a mathematical formula}CnL′(Γ)=Cn(Γ)∩L′. When no subscript is present, it is understood that the operation is relevant to the original language L.</paragraph><paragraph>Finally, some definitions on preorders. A preorder ⪯ over a set V is any reflexive, transitive binary relation in V. The preorder ⪯ is called total iff for all {a mathematical formula}r,r′∈V, {a mathematical formula}r⪯r′ or {a mathematical formula}r′⪯r. We shall write {a mathematical formula}r≺r′ iff {a mathematical formula}r⪯r′ and {a mathematical formula}r′⪯̸r. We shall write {a mathematical formula}r≈r′ iff {a mathematical formula}r⪯r′ and {a mathematical formula}r′⪯r. Moreover, for any {a mathematical formula}X⊆V, by {a mathematical formula}min(X,⪯) we denote the set {a mathematical formula}{r∈X: for all {a mathematical formula}r′∈X, {a mathematical formula}r′⪯r entails {a mathematical formula}r⪯r′}. In the special case where V is ordered by set inclusion, we shall often write {a mathematical formula}min⊆(X) instead of {a mathematical formula}min(X,⊆).</paragraph></section><section label="3"><section-title>The AGM paradigm</section-title><paragraph>Much research in belief revision is based on the work of Alchourrón, Gärdenfors and Makinson [1], who have developed a research framework for this process, known as the AGM paradigm. In this section we shall briefly review two of the principal models for belief revision within the AGM paradigm; the first is based on a set of postulates, and the second on preorders over possible worlds.</paragraph><section label="3.1"><section-title>The AGM postulates</section-title><paragraph>In the AGM paradigm, belief revision is modelled as a function ⁎ mapping a theory K and a sentence ϕ to the theory {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ. The celebrated AGM postulates for revision, which are widely accepted as necessary properties of any rational revision function, are listed below (see [8], [15] for detailed discussion on the postulates){sup:3}:</paragraph><list><list-item label="(K*1)">{a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ is a theory of L.</list-item><list-item label="(K*2)">{a mathematical formula}ϕ∈K⁎ϕ.</list-item><list-item label="(K*3)">{a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ⊆K+ϕ.</list-item><list-item label="(K*4)">If {a mathematical formula}¬ϕ∉K then {a mathematical formula}K+ϕ⊆K⁎ϕ.</list-item><list-item label="(K*5)">{a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ⊨⊥ iff {a mathematical formula}⊨¬ϕ.</list-item><list-item label="(K*6)">If {a mathematical formula}ϕ≡ψ then {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ=K⁎ψ.</list-item><list-item label="(K*7)">{a mathematical formula}K⁎(ϕ∧ψ)⊆(K⁎ϕ)+ψ.</list-item><list-item label="(K*8)">If {a mathematical formula}¬ψ∉K⁎ϕ then {a mathematical formula}(K⁎ϕ)+ψ⊆K⁎(ϕ∧ψ).</list-item></list></section><section label="3.2"><section-title>Faithful preorders</section-title><paragraph>Apart from the above axiomatic approach to belief revision, a number of explicit constructions for this process have been proposed. One popular construction is that proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon, [9], based on total preorders over possible worlds.</paragraph><paragraph>For a theory K, a preorder over possible worlds ⪯ is said to be faithful to K iff it is total and such that the minimal worlds (with respect to ⪯) are those satisfying K; i.e. {a mathematical formula}min(M,⪯)=[K].{sup:4} Given a preorder ⪯ that is faithful to K, the revision of K by any sentence ϕ can be defined as follows:</paragraph><list><list-item label="(⪯⁎)">{a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ=t(min([ϕ],⪯)).</list-item></list><paragraph>Intuitively ⪯ represents a plausibility ranking over possible worlds: the more plausible a world r is, the lower it appears in the ranking. Hence (⪯⁎) essentially defines {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ as the theory corresponding to the most plausible worlds satisfying the new information ϕ.</paragraph><paragraph>Katsuno and Mendelzon proved that the functions induced from faithful preorders are precisely those satisfying the AGM postulates for revision. One of the main aims of this article is to characterise the subclass of faithful preorders that induce revision functions satisfying axiom (P) (in addition to (K*1)–(K*8)).</paragraph><paragraph>For ease of presentation, in this paper we shall not consider the limiting cases of an inconsistent belief set and/or epistemic input, nor a tautological epistemic input. Hence from now, unless explicitly stated otherwise, we assume that the initial belief set K is a consistent theory, and that the epistemic input ϕ is a contingent sentence (i.e. neither a tautology, nor a contradiction).</paragraph></section></section><section label="4"><section-title>Relevance-sensitive belief revision</section-title><paragraph>When revising a theory K by a sentence ϕ it seems plausible to assume that only the beliefs that are relevant to ϕ should be affected, while the rest of the belief corpus is unchanged. For example, an agent that is revising her beliefs about planetary motion is unlikely to revise her beliefs about Malaysian politics. This simple intuition is not fully captured in the AGM paradigm. To see this consider the trivial revision function {a mathematical formula}⁎a defined below:{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>It is not hard to verify that {a mathematical formula}⁎a satisfies all the AGM postulates, and yet it has a rather counter-intuitive effect whenever K is revised by a sentence ϕ that contradicts K: it throws away all beliefs in K that are not logical consequences of ϕ, regardless of whether these beliefs are related to ϕ or not.</paragraph><paragraph>In order to block revision functions like {a mathematical formula}⁎a Parikh [11] introduced a new axiom, named (P), as a supplement to the AGM postulates. The main intuition that axiom (P) aims to capture is that an agent's beliefs can be subdivided into disjoint compartments, referring to different subject matter, and that when revising, the agent modifies only the compartment(s) affected by the new information:</paragraph><list><list-item label="(P)">If {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(χ,ψ) where {a mathematical formula}χ,ψ are sentences of disjoint sublanguages {a mathematical formula}L1, {a mathematical formula}L2 respectively, and {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈L1, then {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ=(CnL1(χ)⋄ϕ)+ψ, where ⋄ is a revision operator of the sublanguage {a mathematical formula}L1.</list-item></list><paragraph>Parikh [11] showed that (P) is consistent with the AGM postulates, (K*1)–(K*6) (known as the basic AGM postulates). Commenting on whether (P) is also consistent with (K*7) and (K*8), Parikh states that “[w]e do not feel that these axioms are consistent with the spirit of our work” and proceeds to give arguments in support of his claim. Later in this paper we prove that axiom (P) is in fact consistent with all eight AGM postulates (K*1)–(K*8).</paragraph></section><section label="5"><section-title>Two readings of axiom (P)</section-title><paragraph>Before proceeding with the formulation of semantics for axiom (P), it is worth taking a closer look at it.</paragraph><paragraph>Consider two sentences {a mathematical formula}χ,ψ∈L, such that {a mathematical formula}Lχ∩Lψ=⌀, and let K be the theory {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(χ,ψ). Moreover, let ϕ be any sentence in {a mathematical formula}Lχ. According to axiom (P), anything outside {a mathematical formula}Lχ will not be affected by the revision of K by ϕ. This however is only one side of axiom (P). The other side concerns the part of the theory K that is related to ϕ, which according to axiom (P) will change to {a mathematical formula}CnLχ(χ)⋄ϕ, where ⋄ is a revision function defined over the sublanguage {a mathematical formula}Lχ. It is this second side of axiom (P) that needs closer examination.</paragraph><paragraph>Axiom (P) is open to two different interpretations. According to the first reading, which we call the weak version of axiom (P), the revision function ⋄ that modifies the relevant part of K – call it the local revision function – may vary from theory to theory, even when the relevant part {a mathematical formula}Cn(χ) stays the same.</paragraph><paragraph>To give a concrete example, let {a mathematical formula}a,b,c be propositional variables, let K be the theory {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(a∧b,c), and let {a mathematical formula}K′ be the theory {a mathematical formula}K′=Cn(a∧b,¬c). Denote by {a mathematical formula}L1 the sublanguage defined over {a mathematical formula}{a,b} and by {a mathematical formula}L2 the sublanguage defined over {a mathematical formula}{c}. Moreover, let ϕ be the sentence {a mathematical formula}ϕ=¬a∨¬b. The part of K and {a mathematical formula}K′ that is relevant to ϕ (in the sense of the language-splitting model) is the same for both theories, namely {a mathematical formula}CnL1(a∧b). Nevertheless, according to weak (P), the local revision operators ⋄ and {a mathematical formula}⋄′ that modify the two identical relevant parts of K and {a mathematical formula}K′ respectively, may very well differ. For example, it could be the case that {a mathematical formula}CnL1(a∧b)⋄(¬a∨¬b)=CnL1(¬a∧b), and {a mathematical formula}CnL1(a∧b)⋄′(¬a∨¬b)=CnL1(a∧¬b), from which it follows that {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ=Cn(¬a,b,c), and {a mathematical formula}K′⁎ϕ=Cn(a,¬b,¬c). In other words, weak (P) allows the local revision function to be context-sensitive. In the previous scenario, the presence of c in K leads to a local revision function ⋄ for {a mathematical formula}CnL1(a∧b) that produces {a mathematical formula}CnL1(¬a∧b) as the result of revising by {a mathematical formula}¬a∨¬b; on the other hand, the presence of ¬c in {a mathematical formula}K′, induces a local revision function {a mathematical formula}⋄′ for {a mathematical formula}CnL1(a∧b) that produces {a mathematical formula}CnL1(a∧¬b) for the same input. Therefore, while c (or ¬c) remains unaffected during the (global) revision by {a mathematical formula}¬a∨¬b (since it is not relevant to the new information), its presence influences the way that the relevant part of the theory is modified.</paragraph><paragraph>To prevent such an influence we need to resort to the strong version of axiom (P) which makes the local revision function ⋄ context-independent. According to strong (P), for any two theories {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(χ,ψ) and {a mathematical formula}K′=Cn(χ,ψ′), such that {a mathematical formula}Lχ∩Lψ=Lχ∩Lψ′=⌀, there exists a single local revision function ⋄ such that {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ=(CnLχ(χ)⋄ϕ)+ψ and {a mathematical formula}K′⁎ϕ=(CnLχ(χ)⋄ϕ)+ψ′, for any {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lχ.</paragraph><paragraph>Depending on the context one could argue in favour of the weak or the strong version of axiom (P). To avoid ambiguity between the two versions, we recast this axiom in terms of the following two conditions that make no reference to a local revision operator:</paragraph><list><list-item label="(R1)">If {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(χ,ψ), {a mathematical formula}Lχ∩Lψ=⌀, and {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lχ, then {a mathematical formula}(K⁎ϕ)∩Lχ‾=K∩Lχ‾.</list-item><list-item label="(R2)">If {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(χ,ψ), {a mathematical formula}Lχ∩Lψ=⌀, and {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lχ, then {a mathematical formula}(K⁎ϕ)∩Lχ=(Cn(χ)⁎ϕ)∩Lχ.</list-item></list><paragraph>Condition (R1) is straightforward: when revising a theory K by a sentence ϕ, the part of K that is not related to ϕ is not affected by the revision. Condition (R1) alone, essentially corresponds to weak (P). To get strong (P) we need to add condition (R2). To see this, consider a revision function ⁎ (which defines a revision policy for all theories of L), and let {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(χ,ψ) and {a mathematical formula}K′=Cn(χ,ψ′) be two theories such that {a mathematical formula}Lχ∩Lψ=Lχ∩Lψ′=⌀. Consider now any sentence {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lχ. The relevant part to ϕ of K and {a mathematical formula}K′ is in both cases the same. Then, according to (R2), the way that this relevant part is modified in both K and {a mathematical formula}K′ is also the same; namely, as dictated by the revision function ⁎ itself when applied to {a mathematical formula}Cn(χ) (once again, recall that ⁎ is defined for all theories, including {a mathematical formula}Cn(χ)).</paragraph><paragraph>Theorem 1 below proves that strong (P) is equivalent to (R1) and (R2). First however let us review an auxiliary result reported in [11] as Lemma A, that will be used extensively in our own proofs.</paragraph><paragraph>Let {a mathematical formula}Q={Q1,Q2,…,Qn} be a partition of P,{sup:5} and let {a mathematical formula}r1,r2,…,rn, be possible worlds. Parikh defines {a mathematical formula}Mix(r1,…,rn;Q1,…,Qn) to denote the unique world r that agrees with {a mathematical formula}r1 on {a mathematical formula}Q1, with {a mathematical formula}r2 on {a mathematical formula}Q2,… , and with {a mathematical formula}rn on {a mathematical formula}Qn; in symbols, {a mathematical formula}r∩Q1±=r1∩Q1±, {a mathematical formula}r∩Q2±=r2∩Q2±,…,r∩Qn±=rn∩Qn±. He then proceeds to prove the following result [11]{sup:6}:</paragraph><paragraph label="Lemma A">(See[11].) Let K be a theory and{a mathematical formula}{Q1,…,Qn}a partition of P. If{a mathematical formula}{Q1,…,Qn}is a K-splitting, then for any{a mathematical formula}r1,…,rn∈[K],{a mathematical formula}Mix(r1,…,rn;Q1,…,Qn)belongs to{a mathematical formula}[K]. Conversely, if{a mathematical formula}Mix(r1,…,rn;Q1,…,Qn)belongs to{a mathematical formula}[K]for all{a mathematical formula}r1,…,rn∈[K], then{a mathematical formula}{Q1,…,Qn}is a K-splitting.</paragraph><paragraph>With the aid of Lemma A we can prove the following result:</paragraph><paragraph label="Theorem 1">Let ⁎ be a revision function satisfying the AGM postulates (K*1)–(K*8). Then ⁎ satisfies strong (P) iff ⁎ satisfies (R1) and (R2).</paragraph><paragraph label="Proof">( ⇐ )Assume that ⁎ satisfies (R1) and (R2). Let K be a theory of L such that {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(χ,ψ), where {a mathematical formula}χ,ψ∈L and {a mathematical formula}Lχ∩Lψ=⌀. As a first step in proving strong (P), we shall show that for any {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lχ, the theory {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ is also split between {a mathematical formula}Pχ and {a mathematical formula}Pχ‾.{sup:7} Assume on the contrary that this is not the case for a particular {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lχ. Then, as shown by Lemma A in [11], there exist {a mathematical formula}r1,r2∈[K⁎ϕ] such that the world {a mathematical formula}r=Mix(r1,r2;Pχ,Pχ‾) does not belong to {a mathematical formula}[K⁎ϕ]. Define α to be the conjunction of literals in {a mathematical formula}r∩Lχ, and β to be the conjunction of literals in {a mathematical formula}r∩Lχ‾. Since α is consistent with {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ, from (K*7) and (K*8) it follows that {a mathematical formula}K⁎(ϕ∧α)=(K⁎ϕ)+α. Therefore, {a mathematical formula}r∉[K⁎(ϕ∧α)]. Consider now any world {a mathematical formula}r′ in {a mathematical formula}[K⁎(ϕ∧α)]. Clearly, {a mathematical formula}r′⊨α, and given that {a mathematical formula}r′≠r, it follows that {a mathematical formula}r′⊨¬β. Since all worlds in {a mathematical formula}[K⁎(ϕ∧α)] satisfy ¬β it follows that {a mathematical formula}¬β∈K⁎(ϕ∧α). Then, by (R1) we derive that {a mathematical formula}¬β∈K, which again by (R1) entails that {a mathematical formula}¬β∈K⁎ϕ. This however contradicts the fact that {a mathematical formula}r∩Lχ‾ is consistent with {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ. Hence we have shown that, given (R1), the theory {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ is split between {a mathematical formula}Pχ and {a mathematical formula}Pχ‾ for all {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lχ.Continuing with the proof of strong (P), we define ⋄ to be the following local (to {a mathematical formula}Lχ) revision operator: for any theory H of {a mathematical formula}Lχ and any sentence {a mathematical formula}γ∈Lχ, {a mathematical formula}H⋄γ=(Cn(H)⁎γ)∩Lχ. It is not hard to verify that ⋄ is indeed an AGM revision operator, i.e., it satisfies the postulates (K*1)–(K*8). Consider now any sentence {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lχ. We conclude the proof of this theorem by showing that {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ=(CnLχ(χ)⋄ϕ)+ψ.Indeed, from (R2) it follows that {a mathematical formula}(K⁎ϕ)∩Lχ=(Cn(χ)⁎ϕ)∩Lχ, and therefore by the construction of ⋄, {a mathematical formula}(K⁎ϕ)∩Lχ=CnLχ(χ)⋄ϕ. Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}Lχ∩Lψ=⌀, we derive that {a mathematical formula}(K⁎ϕ)∩Lχ=((CnLχ(χ)⋄ϕ)+ψ)∩Lχ. On the other hand, from (R1) we have that {a mathematical formula}(K⁎ϕ)∩Lχ‾=K∩Lχ‾=Cn(χ,ψ)∩Lχ‾. Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}Lχ∩Lψ=∅, it follows that {a mathematical formula}Cn(χ,ψ)∩Lχ‾=Cn(ψ)∩Lχ‾, and consequently, {a mathematical formula}(K⁎ϕ)∩Lχ‾=Cn(ψ)∩Lχ‾. Clearly it is also the case that {a mathematical formula}((CnLχ(χ)⋄ϕ)+ψ)∩Lχ‾=Cn(ψ)∩Lχ‾. Putting together the above observations we notice that the two theories, {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ and {a mathematical formula}(CnLχ(χ)⋄ϕ)+ψ are identical when projected on {a mathematical formula}Lχas well as when projected on its complement {a mathematical formula}Lχ‾. Given that, as shown earlier, {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ is split between {a mathematical formula}Pχ and {a mathematical formula}Pχ‾, we derive the desired identity; i.e. {a mathematical formula}K⁎ϕ=(CnLχ(χ)⋄ϕ)+ψ.{sup:8}  ■</paragraph><paragraph>Notice that strong (P) brings about a new feature in the picture of classical AGM revision: it makes associations between the revision policies of different theories. None of the AGM postulates have this property – they all refer to a single theory K – making any combination of revision policies on different theories permissible (as long, of course, as each policy individually satisfies the AGM postulates). This is no longer the case when (R2) is brought into the picture. This condition introduces dependencies between the revisions carried out on different (overlapping) theories. The exact form of these dependences is presented in Section 7.2.</paragraph></section><section label="6"><section-title>The special case of complete theories</section-title><paragraph>Let us now turn to our main objective in this article, which is to formulate possible-worlds semantics for axiom (P), or equivalently for conditions (R1) and (R2). The semantics will be developed progressively in two steps. In the first step, undertaken in this section, we limit ourselves to condition (R1). Moreover we consider only consistent complete theories as belief sets. Then, in the second step (next section), we generalise our results to arbitrary theories and we also bring (R2) into the picture.</paragraph><paragraph>The reason for this two-phase approach is mainly to increase readability and enhance the motivation of the concepts that will be introduced later. Conditions (R1) and (R2) are quite independent of one another so it makes sense to study them separately. Moreover, the characterisation of (R1) in terms of faithful preorders is much more intuitive when confined to complete theories; once this characterisation is well understood for the special case, its generalisation, although far from trivial, is easier to follow.</paragraph><paragraph>Let K be a consistent complete theory, and let ⪯ be a preorder faithful to K. As already mentioned, the intended reading of ⪯ is that it represents comparative plausibility between possible worlds i.e., the higher a world appears in ⪯, the less plausible it is. Yet, in the general framework developed by Katsuno and Mendelzon [9], there are no guidelines about how comparative plausibility should be measured. It turns out that condition (R1) does precisely that: it prescribes that the plausibility of any world r is closely related to the set of propositional variables that have different values in r and K.</paragraph><paragraph>In particular, let {a mathematical formula}r,r′ be any two possible worlds of L. By {a mathematical formula}Diff(r,r′) we denote the set of propositional variables that have different truth values in the two worlds (i.e., the symmetric difference of the variables that are satisfied by the two worlds):{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>Notice that the above definition can be applied verbatim to also include consistent complete theories as arguments of Diff; e.g. if K is a consistent complete theory and r a possible world, {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)=((K−r)∪(r−K))∩P.</paragraph><paragraph>Let us now examine more closely the faithful preorder ⪯ that can be assigned to a consistent complete theory K. Clearly, {a mathematical formula}[K]={w} for some world w, and therefore w has to be minimum with respect to ⪯. What about the remaining worlds? How should their plausibility be measured from K's point of view? Condition (SP) below gives some guidelines (throughout this paper, the symbols r and {a mathematical formula}r′ always represent possible worlds){sup:9}:</paragraph><list><list-item label="(SP)">If {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)⊂Diff(K,r′) then {a mathematical formula}r≺r′.</list-item></list><paragraph>According to condition (SP), the less a world r differs from the initial belief set K in propositional variables, the more plausible it is. Notice that condition (SP) places no constraints on the relative order of worlds that are Diff-incomparable. In other words, for two worlds r and {a mathematical formula}r′ such that neither {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)⊂Diff(K,r′) nor {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r′)⊂Diff(K,r), their relative order with respect to ⪯ is not constrained by (SP).</paragraph><paragraph>The idea of relating the plausibility of a world r to the variables that have different truth values in r and the initial belief set K, is not new in Belief Revision. Borgida [2], Dalal [6], Satoh [17], and Winslet [18], have all developed specific operators that use this very idea (in different ways). We shall discuss Dalal's operator separately in Section 8. For the remaining operators, and for the shake of clarity in making comparisons, let us restrict our attention to the principal case where the epistemic input ϕ is inconsistent with the initial (consistent and complete) belief set K. Under these assumptions, Borgida's operator, Satoh's operator, and Winslet's operator, collapse to the same operator, which herein we will denote by {a mathematical formula}⁎g. This operator, can be defined in terms of the following partial order {a mathematical formula}⊑g on possible worlds:</paragraph><list><list-item label="(BSW)">{a mathematical formula}r⊑gr′ iff {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)⊆Diff(K,r′).</list-item></list><paragraph>Given {a mathematical formula}⊑g, the operator {a mathematical formula}⁎g is defined as {a mathematical formula}K⁎gϕ=t(min([ϕ],⊑g)). Clearly {a mathematical formula}⊑g is not total, which is the main reason why {a mathematical formula}⁎g fails to satisfy all the AGM postulates for revision (see [9] for details). Nevertheless, there is a striking resemblance between (BSW) and (SP) – in fact (SP) is just a weakening of (BSW).</paragraph><paragraph>It is also worth mentioning that condition (SP) already appears in [14] and [13] (expressed as a constraint on systems of spheres), where its characterisation in terms of epistemic entrenchments, [7], is investigated.</paragraph><paragraph>Hence (SP) is a natural constraint on plausibility rankings that has been studied independently in Belief Revision. It turns out that, for the special case of consistent complete belief sets, (SP) is also the semantic counterpart of (R1). However before presenting the formal result, let us consider intuitively why this might be so.</paragraph><paragraph>Let K be a consistent complete theory, and ⪯ a preorder that is faithful to K. Moreover assume that ⪯ satisfies (SP). Since K is a consistent complete theory, there is a world w such that {a mathematical formula}[K]={w}, and therefore w is the first world with respect to ⪯. Consider any consistent sentence ϕ that contradicts K (i.e., {a mathematical formula}¬ϕ∈K). Loosely speaking, the set of ϕ-worlds occupy a territory in ⪯ that is disjoint from w. At the farthest end of this ϕ-territory there are worlds that look very different from w. However, as we move closer to w, the ϕ-worlds that we meet agree with w in progressively more and more propositional variables. By the time we reach the lower boundary of the ϕ-territory, all the ϕ-worlds agree with w in all propositional variables, except those that need to change values to make ϕ true. The crucial observation is that all such changed variables belong to {a mathematical formula}Lϕ; thus (R1).</paragraph><paragraph>The above intuitive explanation is formally expressed in the proof of the following result:</paragraph><paragraph label="Theorem 2">Let ⁎ be a revision function satisfying (K*1)–(K*8), K a consistent complete theory of L, and ⪯ a preorder faithful to K, corresponding to ⁎ by means of (⪯⁎). Then ⁎ satisfies (R1) at K iff ⪯ satisfies (SP).</paragraph><paragraph label="Proof">( ⇐ )Assume that ⪯ satisfies (SP), and let {a mathematical formula}χ,ψ be sentences in L, such that {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(χ,ψ) and {a mathematical formula}Lχ∩Lψ=⌀. Consider now any sentence {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lχ, and let r be any world in {a mathematical formula}[K⁎ϕ]; i.e., {a mathematical formula}r∈min([ϕ],⪯). Firstly we show that {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)⊆Lχ. Assume on the contrary that there is a literal {a mathematical formula}l∈K∩Lχ‾, such that {a mathematical formula}l∉r. Let {a mathematical formula}r′ be the world that agrees with r in all literals except l. Clearly then, since {a mathematical formula}r⊨ϕ and {a mathematical formula}l∉Lϕ, we derive that {a mathematical formula}r′⊨ϕ. Moreover, by the construction of {a mathematical formula}r′, {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r′)⊂Diff(K,r). Consequently, by (SP), {a mathematical formula}r′≺r. This clearly contradicts are assumption that r is a minimal ϕ-world. Hence we have shown that {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)⊆Lχ. This shows that all worlds r in {a mathematical formula}[K⁎ϕ] agree with K on all variables outside {a mathematical formula}Lχ. Therefore {a mathematical formula}K∩Lχ‾=(K⁎ϕ)∩Lχ‾ as desired.  ■</paragraph><paragraph>As already mentioned in the introduction, what is quite appealing about Theorem 2 is that it characterises (R1), not in terms of some technical non-intuitive condition, but rather by a natural constraint on plausibility rankings, that in fact predates (R1) and has been motivated independently. Moreover, as we will show in the next section, the essence of this characterisation of (R1) carries over into the general case of incomplete belief sets (albeit with some modifications).</paragraph></section><section label="7"><section-title>The general case</section-title><paragraph>To elevate Theorem 2 to the general case, we first need to extend the definition of Diff to cover comparisons between a world r and an arbitrary, possibly incomplete, theory K. An obvious candidate would be the set {a mathematical formula}⋃{Diff(w,r):w∈[K]}; let us denote this set as {a mathematical formula}Diffall(K,r). Another plausible solution would be to take the union of the minimal elements of {a mathematical formula}{Diff(w,r):w∈[K]} with respect to set inclusion. Let as denote this set as {a mathematical formula}Diffmin(K,r); i.e. {a mathematical formula}Diffmin(K,r)=⋃min⊆({Diff(w,r):w∈[K]}).</paragraph><paragraph>To illustrate the difference between the two definitions consider the following simple example. Assume that {a mathematical formula}P={a,b} and let {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(a). Clearly {a mathematical formula}[K] contains only two worlds, namely the worlds {a mathematical formula}w1={a,b} and {a mathematical formula}w2={a,¬b}. Consider now the world {a mathematical formula}r={¬a,¬b}. Then {a mathematical formula}Diff(w1,r)={a,b} and {a mathematical formula}Diff(w2,r)={a}. Hence {a mathematical formula}Diffmin(K,r)={a}, whereas {a mathematical formula}Diffall(K,r)={a,b}.</paragraph><paragraph>It turns out however that neither {a mathematical formula}Diffall nor {a mathematical formula}Diffmin is appropriate for generalising Theorem 2. The reason is that both definitions fail to take into account the concept of a K-splitting that is central to Parikh's notion of relevance. The right solution is somewhere in between.</paragraph><paragraph>Let K be a theory and {a mathematical formula}Q={Q1,…,Qn} a partition of P{sup:10}; i.e. {a mathematical formula}⋃Q=P, {a mathematical formula}Qi≠⌀, and {a mathematical formula}Qi∩Qj=⌀, for all {a mathematical formula}1≤i≠j≤n. We say that {a mathematical formula}Q={Q1,…,Qn} is a K-splitting iff there exist sentences {a mathematical formula}ϕ1∈LQ1, … , {a mathematical formula}ϕn∈LQn, such that {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(ϕ1,…,ϕn). Parikh has shown in [11] that for every theory K there is a unique finest K-splitting, i.e. one which refines every other K-splitting.{sup:11}</paragraph><paragraph>We can now define the difference between a (possibly incomplete) theory K and a world r using the finest splitting of K, call it {a mathematical formula}F, as follows:{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>To understand the intuition behind the above definition, let us consider a concrete example. Let {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(a↔b,c↔d), where {a mathematical formula}a,b,c,d are propositional variables. The finest splitting of K is {a mathematical formula}F={{a,b},{c,d}}. Let r be the world {a mathematical formula}r={¬a,b,c,d}. Then according to the above definition {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)={a,b}, despite the fact that there is a K-world, namely {a mathematical formula}w={a,b,c,d}, that differs from r only in a. Essentially, the generalised definition of Diff treats the elements of {a mathematical formula}F as indivisible{sup:12}; hence for any {a mathematical formula}s∈F, either s is contained entirely in {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r), or not at all. This in turn is determined by whether or not K and r disagree on at least one sentence that can be expressed in terms of the variables in s.</paragraph><paragraph>It is not hard to verify that in the special case of a consistent complete theory K, the above definition of Diff collapses to the one given in the previous section. Moreover observe that for any world {a mathematical formula}r∈[K], {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)=⌀; and conversely, if {a mathematical formula}r∉[K], {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)≠⌀.{sup:13}</paragraph><paragraph>The relationship between our definition of Diff and the alternatives {a mathematical formula}Diffall and {a mathematical formula}Diffmin discussed earlier is given below:</paragraph><paragraph label="Theorem 3">Let K be a consistent theory and r a possible world.

Then there exists a {a mathematical formula}w′∈[K] such that {a mathematical formula}y∈Diff(w′,r) and {a mathematical formula}Diff(w′,r)∈min⊆({Diff(w,r):w∈[K]}). Define {a mathematical formula}l=y if {a mathematical formula}y∈w′, and {a mathematical formula}l=¬y otherwise. Let {a mathematical formula}Fi∈F be the element of F containing y; i.e. {a mathematical formula}y∈Fi. We show that {a mathematical formula}r⊨¬xi. For assume that {a mathematical formula}r⊨xi. Define {a mathematical formula}w″ to be the world that agrees with r on the variables in {a mathematical formula}Fi, and agrees with {a mathematical formula}w′ on the remaining variables. Then, by Lemma A, {a mathematical formula}w″∈[K]. Moreover, it is not hard to verify that {a mathematical formula}Diff(w″,r)⊂Diff(w′,r), which of course contradicts our assumption that {a mathematical formula}Diff(w′,r) is ⊆-minimal in {a mathematical formula}{Diff(w,r):w∈[K]}. Hence, {a mathematical formula}r⊨¬xi. This again entails that {a mathematical formula}Fi⊆Diff(K,r), and therefore {a mathematical formula}y∈Diff(K,r) as desired.For the second set containment, let y be any variable in {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r), and let {a mathematical formula}Fi be the element of the finest K-splitting that contains y. Define {a mathematical formula}l=y if {a mathematical formula}r⊨¬y, and {a mathematical formula}l=¬y otherwise. Observe that not all worlds in {a mathematical formula}[K] can be ¬l-worlds, because that would contradict {a mathematical formula}y∈Diff(K,r). Consequently, there is a {a mathematical formula}w′∈[K] such that {a mathematical formula}w′⊨l. Hence {a mathematical formula}y∈Diff(w′,r), and therefore {a mathematical formula}y∈⋃{Diff(w,r):w∈[K]} as desired.  ■</paragraph><paragraph>We note that for appropriate choices of K and r, both set-containments in Theorem 3 become strict set-containments.</paragraph><paragraph>In particular, assume that {a mathematical formula}P={a,b,c,d,e}, let {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(a→(b∧c),d↔e) and {a mathematical formula}r={a,¬b,c,d,e}.

Moreover, observe that the worlds {a mathematical formula}w1={¬a,¬b,c,d,e}, {a mathematical formula}w2={a,b,c,d,e} belong to {a mathematical formula}[K], and that {a mathematical formula}Diff(w1,r)={a} and {a mathematical formula}Diff(w2,r)={b}. Furthermore notice that every K-world differs from r in at least a or b. Hence {a mathematical formula}Diffmin(K,r)={a,b}⊂Diff(K,r). For the second set-containment of Theorem 3, let {a mathematical formula}w3 be the world {a mathematical formula}w3={¬a,b,¬c,¬d,¬e}.

Assume that L is built from the propositional variables a, b, c, d, and let K be the theory {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(a↔b,c↔d).

Next, let ⪯ be the following total preorder{sup:14}:{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>It is not hard to verify that the revision function ⁎ induced by the above preorder ⪯, satisfies (R1).

Although {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)={c,d}⊂Diff(K,r′)={a,b,c,d}, the two worlds r and {a mathematical formula}r′ are equidistant from the beginning of ⪯.</paragraph><paragraph>Despite its failure to generalise, (SP) should not be disregarded altogether. It can still serve as a guide in formulating the appropriate counterpart(s) of (R1) for the general case. In particular, consider the conditions (Q1) and (Q2) below:</paragraph><list><list-item label="(Q1)">If {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)⊂Diff(K,r′) and {a mathematical formula}Diff(r,r′)∩Diff(K,r)=∅, then {a mathematical formula}r≺r′.</list-item><list-item label="(Q2)">If {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)=Diff(K,r′) and {a mathematical formula}Diff(r,r′)∩Diff(K,r)=∅, then {a mathematical formula}r≈r′.</list-item></list><paragraph>Both conditions (Q1) and (Q2) are variants of (SP). Like (SP), both these conditions relate the plausibility of a world r to its difference {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r) from the initial belief set K.</paragraph><paragraph>In particular, condition (Q1) is a weakening of (SP). The antecedent of (Q1) is stronger than the one of (SP) since it requires not only that r differs from K in strictly fewer variables than {a mathematical formula}r′, but moreover that whatever difference exists between r and {a mathematical formula}r′ is outside{a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r) (or equivalently, that r and {a mathematical formula}r′ agree on the variables in {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)). The previous example illustrates that (Q1) is in fact a strict weakening of (SP), since the preorder of the example violates (SP) but satisfies (Q1). Of course, in the special case of a consistent complete theory as an initial belief set, (Q1) and (SP) are equivalent.</paragraph><paragraph>Condition (Q2) is also in the spirit of (SP). It deals with the limiting case of two possible worlds r and {a mathematical formula}r′ that differ form K on exactly the same variables and moreover, they agree between them on the value of these variables. For such worlds, (Q2) states that they ought to be equally plausible. For the special case of a consistent and complete initial belief set, (Q2) reduces to a vacuous condition. The previous example gives an example of a preorder that satisfies (Q2).</paragraph><paragraph>Theorem 4 below is a generalisation of Theorem 2.

If {a mathematical formula}[K]∩[ϕ]≠⌀, then this can be easily verified to be true. Assume therefore that {a mathematical formula}[K]∩[ϕ]=⌀.Firstly we show that {a mathematical formula}K∩Lx‾⊆(K⁎ϕ)∩Lx‾. Let ψ be any sentence in {a mathematical formula}K∩Lx‾ and assume for contradiction that {a mathematical formula}ψ∉(K⁎ϕ)∩Lx‾. Then there is a minimal ϕ-world r (with respect to ⪯) such that {a mathematical formula}r⊨¬ψ. Let {a mathematical formula}w′ be any world in {a mathematical formula}[K].

Moreover by construction, {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,w)⊆Diff(K,r) and {a mathematical formula}Diff(w,r)∩Diff(K,w)=∅. In addition observe that, since {a mathematical formula}ψ∈K∩Lx‾ and {a mathematical formula}r⊨¬ψ, {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)∩Lx‾≠⌀. On the other hand, by construction, {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,w)⊆Lx. Combining the above we derive that {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,w)⊂Diff(K,r).

Clearly then r is a minimal ϕ-world with respect to ⪯. Construct w as follows: {a mathematical formula}w=(r∩Lx)∪(r′∩Lx‾). Since {a mathematical formula}ϕ∈Lx and {a mathematical formula}ψ∈Lx‾ we immediately derive that {a mathematical formula}w⊨ϕ and {a mathematical formula}w⊨¬ψ. Moreover by construction, {a mathematical formula}Diff(w,r)∩Diff(K,w)=∅ and {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,w)⊆Diff(K,r). In fact, given that r is a minimal ϕ-world and {a mathematical formula}w∈[ϕ], from (Q1) we derive that {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,w)⊄Diff(K,r). Consequently, {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,w)=Diff(K,r) and therefore from (Q2) it follows that {a mathematical formula}w≈r.

This again entails that {a mathematical formula}r⊏Kr′ as desired.For (Q2), let K be a consistent theory and let {a mathematical formula}r,r′ be any two possible worlds such that {a mathematical formula}Diff(K,r)=Diff(K,r′) and {a mathematical formula}Diff(r,r′)∩Diff(K,r). Then there exists a world {a mathematical formula}w∈[K] such that {a mathematical formula}|Diff(w,r)|≤|Diff(z′,r)∩Diff(K,r)|, for all {a mathematical formula}z′∈[K].{sup:19}Consider now any world {a mathematical formula}w′∈[K]. Then in view of the above we derive that,{a mathematical formula}Hence {a mathematical formula}|Diff(w,r)|≤|Diff(w′,r′)| for all {a mathematical formula}w′∈[K], which again implies that {a mathematical formula}r⊑Kr′ as desired. By a totally symmetric argument we can also show that {a mathematical formula}r′⊑Kr. Hence {a mathematical formula}r≈r′ as desired.Finally for (Q3), let K be a consistent theory such that for some {a mathematical formula}x,y∈L, {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(x,y) and {a mathematical formula}Lx∩Ly=⌀. First we show that {a mathematical formula}⊑Kx⊆⊑Cn(x)x.Let {a mathematical formula}r,r′ be two worlds such that {a mathematical formula}r⊑Kxr′. Then there is a {a mathematical formula}z∈[rx] such that {a mathematical formula}z⊑Kz′, for all {a mathematical formula}z′∈[rx′]. Consequently, there is a {a mathematical formula}w∈[K] such that {a mathematical formula}|Diff(w,z)|≤|Diff(w′,z′)|, for all {a mathematical formula}w′∈[K] and {a mathematical formula}z′∈[rx′]. Consider now any two worlds {a mathematical formula}u′∈[Cn(x)] and {a mathematical formula}z′∈[rx′]. Let {a mathematical formula}w′ be any world in {a mathematical formula}[K]. Define {a mathematical formula}w″ to be the world that agrees with {a mathematical formula}u′ on the variables in {a mathematical formula}Lx and with {a mathematical formula}w′ on the remaining variables. From Lemma A it follows that {a mathematical formula}w″∈[K]. Moreover define {a mathematical formula}z″ to be the world that agrees with {a mathematical formula}z′ on the variables in {a mathematical formula}Lx and with {a mathematical formula}w″ on the remaining variables. Clearly, {a mathematical formula}z″∈[rx′], {a mathematical formula}Diff(w″,z″)∩Lx=Diff(u′,z′)∩Lx, and {a mathematical formula}Diff(w″,z″)∩Lx‾=⌀. Consequently,{a mathematical formula}We note that the last inequality follows from the fact that {a mathematical formula}w″∈[K] and {a mathematical formula}z″∈[rx′].Hence we have shown that for all {a mathematical formula}u′∈[Cn(x)] and {a mathematical formula}z′∈[rx′], {a mathematical formula}|Diff(u′,z′)|≥|Diff(w,z)|. Since, clearly, {a mathematical formula}w∈[Cn(x)] and {a mathematical formula}z∈[rx], we derive that {a mathematical formula}r⊑Cn(x)xr′. Consequently, we have proved that {a mathematical formula}⊑Kx⊆⊑Cn(x)x. The proof of the converse is totally symmetric.  ■</paragraph></section><section label="9"><section-title>Conclusion</section-title><paragraph>Parikh, [11], has argued for the central role of relevance in Belief Revision and has shown that the AGM postulates for revision are too liberal in their treatment of this notion. He therefore proposed a new intuitive postulate, called axiom (P), to augment the ones proposed by AGM.</paragraph><paragraph>In this article we developed possible-world semantics for axiom (P). We also proved, contrary to what was conjectured in [11], that axiom (P) is consistent with the full set of the AGM postulates for revision. Consistency was established by showing that Dalal's well-known revision operator satisfies (P).</paragraph><paragraph>What is quite appealing about our results is that the semantic conditions (Q1)–(Q3) that characterise axiom (P) are natural constraints on the comparative plausibility of possible worlds. In fact condition (SP), which is equivalent to (Q1)–(Q2) in the special case of consistent complete belief sets, has been motivated independently and studied by other authors; for example a translation of (SP) in the realm of epistemic entrenchments, [7], already exists [13]. An interesting direction for future work would be to extend this translation to cover condition (Q3) as well as belief sets that are not necessarily complete.</paragraph><paragraph>Finally, an interesting by-product of our study is the identification of the two possible readings of axiom (P), both of which are plausible depending on the context.</paragraph><section-title>Acknowledgements</section-title></section></content><acknowledgements><paragraph>We are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on this work.</paragraph></acknowledgements><references><reference label="[1]"><authors>C.
