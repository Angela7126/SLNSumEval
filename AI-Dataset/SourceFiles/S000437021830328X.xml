There is a sign that says that one of the two roads leads to prosperity, another to death. The agent must take the fork, but she does not know which road leads where. Does the agent have a strategy to get to prosperity? On one hand, since one of the roads leads to prosperity, such a strategy clearly exists. We denote this fact by modal formula {a mathematical formula}Sap, where statement p is a claim of future prosperity. Furthermore, agent a knows that such a strategy exists. We write this as {a mathematical formula}KaSap. Yet, the agent does not know what the strategy is and, thus, does not know how to use the strategy. We denote this by {a mathematical formula}¬Hap, where know-how modality {a mathematical formula}Ha expresses the fact that agent a knows how to achieve the goal based on the information available to her. In this article we study the interplay between modality {a mathematical formula}K, representing knowledge, modality {a mathematical formula}S, representing the existence of a strategy, and modality {a mathematical formula}H, representing the existence of a know-how strategy. Our main result is a complete trimodal axiomatic system capturing properties of this interplay.</paragraph><section label="1.1"><section-title>Epistemic transition systems</section-title><paragraph>In this article we use epistemic transition systems to capture knowledge and strategic behavior. Informally, epistemic transition system is a directed labeled graph supplemented by an indistinguishability relation on vertices. For instance, our motivational example above can be captured by epistemic transition system {a mathematical formula}T1 depicted in Fig. 1. In this system state w represents the prosperity and state {a mathematical formula}w′ represents death. The original state is u, but it is indistinguishable by the agent a from state v. Arrows on the diagram represent possible transitions between the states. Labels on the arrows represent the choices that the agents make during the transition. For example, if in state u agent chooses left (L) road, she will transition to the prosperity state w and if she chooses right (R) road, she will transition to the death state {a mathematical formula}w′. In another epistemic state v, these roads lead the other way around. States u and v are not distinguishable by agent a, which is shown by the dashed line between these two states. In state u as well as state v the agent has a strategy to transition to the state of prosperity: {a mathematical formula}u⊩Sap and {a mathematical formula}v⊩Sap. In the case of state u this strategy is L, in the case of state v the strategy is R. Since the agent cannot distinguish states u and v, in both of these states she does not have a know-how strategy to reach prosperity: {a mathematical formula}u⊮Hap and {a mathematical formula}v⊮Hap. At the same time, since formula {a mathematical formula}Sap is satisfied in all states indistinguishable to agent a from state u, we can claim that {a mathematical formula}u⊩KaSap and, similarly, {a mathematical formula}v⊩KaSap.</paragraph><paragraph>As our second example, let us consider the epistemic transition system {a mathematical formula}T2 obtained from {a mathematical formula}T1 by swapping labels on transitions from v to w and from v to {a mathematical formula}w′, see Fig. 2. Although in system {a mathematical formula}T2 agent a still cannot distinguish states u and v, she has a know-how strategy from either of these states to reach state w. We write this as {a mathematical formula}u⊩Hap and {a mathematical formula}v⊩Hap. The strategy is to choose L. This strategy is know-how because it does not require to make different choices in the states that the agent cannot distinguish.</paragraph></section><section label="1.2"><section-title>Imperfect recall</section-title><paragraph>For the next example, we consider a transition system {a mathematical formula}T3 obtained from system {a mathematical formula}T1 by adding a new epistemic state s. (See Fig. 3.) From state s, agent a can choose label L to reach state u or choose label R to reach state v. Since proposition q is satisfied in state u, agent a has a know-how strategy to transition from state s to a state (namely, state u) where q is satisfied. Therefore, {a mathematical formula}s⊩Haq.</paragraph><paragraph>A more interesting question is whether {a mathematical formula}s⊩HaHap is true. In other words, does agent a know how to transition from state s to a state in which she knows how to transition to another state in which p is satisfied? One might think that such a strategy indeed exists: in state s agent a chooses label L to transition to state u. Since there is no transition labeled by L that leads from state s to state v, upon ending the first transition the agent would know that she is in state u, where she needs to choose label L to transition to state w. This argument, however, is based on the assumption that agent a has a perfect recall. Namely, agent a in state u remembers the choice that she made in the previous state. We assume that the agents do not have a perfect recall and that an epistemic state description captures whatever memories the agent has in this state. In other words, in this article we assume that the only knowledge that an agent possesses is the knowledge captured by the indistinguishability relation on the epistemic states. Given this assumption, upon reaching the state u (indistinguishable from state v) agent a knows that there exists a choice that she can make to transition to state in which p is satisfied: {a mathematical formula}s⊩HaSap. However, she does not know which choice (L or R) it is: {a mathematical formula}s⊮HaHap.</paragraph></section><section label="1.3"><section-title>Multiagent setting</section-title><paragraph>So far, we have assumed that only agent a has an influence on which transition the system takes. In transition system {a mathematical formula}T4 depicted in Fig. 4, we introduce another agent b and assume both agents a and b have influence on the transitions. In each state, the system takes the transition labeled D by default unless there is a consensus of agents a and b to take the transition labeled C. In such a setting, each agent has a strategy to transition system from state u into state w by voting D, but neither of them alone has a strategy to transition from state u to state {a mathematical formula}w′ because such a transition requires the consensus of both agents. Thus, {a mathematical formula}u⊩Sap∧Sbp∧¬Saq∧¬Sbq. Additionally, both agents know how to transition the system from state u into state w, they just need to vote D. Therefore, {a mathematical formula}u⊩Hap∧Hbp.</paragraph><paragraph>In Fig. 5, we show a more complicated transition system obtained from {a mathematical formula}T1 by renaming label L to D and renaming label R to C. Same as in transition system {a mathematical formula}T4, we assume that there are two agents a and b voting on the system transition. We also assume that agent a cannot distinguish states u and v while agent b can. By default, the system takes the transition labeled D unless there is a consensus to take transition labeled C. As a result, agent a has a strategy (namely, vote D) in state u to transition system to state w, but because agent a cannot distinguish state u from state v, not only does she not know how to do this, but she is not aware that such a strategy exists: {a mathematical formula}u⊩Sap∧¬Hap∧¬KaSap. Agent b, however, not only has a strategy to transition the system from state u to state w, but also knows how to achieve this: {a mathematical formula}u⊩Hbp.</paragraph></section><section label="1.4"><section-title>Coalitions</section-title><paragraph>We have talked about strategies, know-hows, and knowledge of individual agents. In this article we consider knowledge, strategies, and know-how strategies of coalitions. There are several forms of group knowledge that have been studied before. The two most popular of them are common knowledge and distributed knowledge [1]. Different contexts call for different forms of group knowledge.</paragraph><paragraph>As illustrated in the famous Two Generals' Problem [2], [3] where communication channels between the agents are unreliable, establishing a common knowledge between agents might be essential for having a strategy.</paragraph><paragraph>In some settings, the distinction between common and distributed knowledge is insignificant. For example, if members of a political fraction get together to share all their information and to develop a common strategy, then the distributed knowledge of the members becomes the common knowledge of the fraction during the in-person meeting.</paragraph><paragraph>Finally, in some other situations the distributed knowledge makes more sense than the common knowledge. For example, if a panel of experts is formed to develop a strategy, then this panel achieves the best result if it relies on the combined knowledge of its members rather than on their common knowledge.</paragraph><paragraph>In this article we focus on distributed coalition knowledge and distributed-know-how strategies. We leave the common knowledge for the future research. Establishing distributed knowledge though communication between agents might affect what is known by individual agents [4], but the communication between agents is out of the scope of this paper.</paragraph><paragraph>To illustrate how distributed knowledge of coalitions interacts with strategies and know-hows, consider epistemic transition system {a mathematical formula}T6 depicted in Fig. 6. In this system, agents a and b cannot distinguish states u and v while agents b and c cannot distinguish states v and {a mathematical formula}u′. In every state, each of agents a, b and c votes either L or R, and the system transitions according to the majority vote. In such a setting, any coalition of two agents can fully control the transitions of the system.</paragraph><paragraph>For example, by both voting L, agents a and b form a coalition {a mathematical formula}{a,b} that forces the system to transition from state u to state w no matter how agent c votes. Since proposition p is satisfied in state w, we write {a mathematical formula}u⊩S{a,b}p, or simply {a mathematical formula}u⊩Sa,bp. Similarly, coalition {a mathematical formula}{a,b} can vote R to force the system to transition from state v to state w. Therefore, coalition {a mathematical formula}{a,b} has strategies to achieve p in states u and v, but the strategies are different. Since they cannot distinguish states u and v, agents a and b know that they have a strategy to achieve p, but they do not know how to achieve p. In our notations, {a mathematical formula}v⊩Sa,bp∧Ka,bSa,bp∧¬Ha,bp.</paragraph><paragraph>On the other hand, although agents b and c cannot distinguish states v and {a mathematical formula}u′, by both voting R in either of states v and {a mathematical formula}u′, they form a coalition {a mathematical formula}{b,c} that forces the system to transition to state w where p is satisfied. Therefore, in any of states v and {a mathematical formula}u′, they not only have a strategy to achieve p, but also know that they have such a strategy, and more importantly, they know how to achieve p, that is, {a mathematical formula}v⊩Hb,cp.</paragraph></section><section label="1.5"><section-title>Nondeterministic transitions</section-title><paragraph>In all the examples that we have discussed so far, given any state in a system, agents' votes uniquely determine the transition of the system. Our framework also allows nondeterministic transitions. Consider transition system {a mathematical formula}T7 depicted in Fig. 7. In this system, there are two agents a and b who can vote either C or D. If both agents vote C, then the system takes one of the consensus transitions labeled with C. Otherwise, the system takes the transition labeled with D. Note that there are two consensus transitions starting from state u. Therefore, even if both agents vote C, they do not have a strategy to achieve p, i.e., {a mathematical formula}u⊮Sa,bp. However, they can achieve {a mathematical formula}p∨q. Moreover, since all agents can distinguish all states, we have {a mathematical formula}u⊩Ha,b(p∨q).</paragraph></section><section label="1.6"><section-title>Universal principles</section-title><paragraph>In the examples above we focused on specific properties that were either satisfied or not satisfied in particular states of epistemic transition systems {a mathematical formula}T1 through {a mathematical formula}T7. In this article, we study properties that are satisfied in all states of all epistemic transition systems. Our main result is a sound and complete axiomatization of all such properties. We finish the introduction with an informal discussion of these properties.</paragraph><paragraph>Properties of single modalities  Knowledge modality {a mathematical formula}KC satisfies the axioms of epistemic logic S5 with distributed knowledge. Both strategic modality {a mathematical formula}SC and know-how modality {a mathematical formula}HC satisfy cooperation properties [5], [6]:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} They also satisfy monotonicity properties{a mathematical formula} The two monotonicity properties are not among the axioms of our logical system because, as we show in Lemma 5 and Lemma 3, they are derivable.</paragraph><paragraph>Properties of interplay  Note that {a mathematical formula}w⊩HCφ means that coalition C has the same strategy to achieve φ in all epistemic states indistinguishable by the coalition from state w. Hence, the following principle is universally true:{a mathematical formula} Similarly, {a mathematical formula}w⊩¬HCφ means that coalition C does not have the same strategy to achieve φ in all epistemic states indistinguishable by the coalition from state w. Thus,{a mathematical formula} We call properties (3) and (4)strategic positive introspection and strategic negative introspection, respectively. The strategic negative introspection is one of our axioms. Just as how the positive introspection principle follows from the rest of the axioms in S5 (see Lemma 14), the strategic positive introspection principle is also derivable (see Lemma 1).</paragraph><paragraph>Whenever a coalition knows how to achieve something, there should exist a strategy for the coalition to achieve. In our notation,{a mathematical formula} We call this formula strategic truth property and it is one of the axioms of our logical system.</paragraph><paragraph>The last two axioms of our logical system deal with empty coalitions. First of all, if formula {a mathematical formula}K∅φ is satisfied in an epistemic state of our transition system, then formula φ must be satisfied in every state of this system. Thus, even empty coalition has a trivial strategy to achieve φ:{a mathematical formula} We call this property empty coalition principle. In this article we assume that an epistemic transition system never halts. That is, in every state of the system no matter what the outcome of the vote is, there is always a next state for this vote. This restriction on the transition systems yields property{a mathematical formula} that we call nontermination principle.</paragraph><paragraph>Let us now turn to the most interesting and perhaps most unexpected property of interplay. Note that {a mathematical formula}S∅φ means that an empty coalition has a strategy to achieve φ. Since the empty coalition has no members, nobody has to vote in a particular way. Statement φ is guaranteed to happen anyway. Thus, statement {a mathematical formula}S∅φ simply means that statement φ is unavoidably satisfied after any single transition.</paragraph><paragraph>For example, consider an epistemic transition system depicted in Fig. 8. As in some of our earlier examples, this system has agents a and b who vote either C or D. If both agents vote C, then the system takes one of the consensus transitions labeled with C. Otherwise, the system takes the default transition labeled with D. Note that in state v it is guaranteed that statement p will happen after a single transition. Thus, {a mathematical formula}v⊩S∅p. At the same time, neither agent a nor agent b knows about this because they cannot distinguish state v from states u and {a mathematical formula}u′ respectively. Thus, {a mathematical formula}v⊩¬KaS∅p∧¬KbS∅p.</paragraph><paragraph>In the same transition system {a mathematical formula}T8, agents a and b together can distinguish state v from states u and {a mathematical formula}u′. Thus, {a mathematical formula}v⊩Ka,bS∅p. In general, statement {a mathematical formula}KCS∅φ means that not only φ is unavoidable, but coalition C knows about it. Thus, coalition C has a know-how strategy to achieve φ:{a mathematical formula} In fact, the coalition would achieve the result no matter which strategy it uses. Coalition C can even use a strategy that simultaneously achieves another result in addition to φ:{a mathematical formula} In our logical system we use an equivalent form of the above principle that is stated using only implication:{a mathematical formula} We call this property epistemic determinicity principle. Properties (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8), together with axioms of epistemic logic S5 with distributed knowledge and propositional tautologies constitute the axioms of our sound and complete logical system.</paragraph></section><section label="1.7"><section-title>Literature review</section-title><paragraph>Logics of coalition power were developed by Marc Pauly [5], [6], who also proved the completeness of the basic logic of coalition power. Pauly's approach has been widely studied in the literature [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. An alternative logical system was proposed by More and Naumov [14].</paragraph><paragraph>Alur, Henzinger, and Kupferman introduced Alternating-Time Temporal Logic (ATL) that combines temporal and coalition modalities [15]. Van der Hoek and Wooldridge proposed to combine ATL with epistemic modality to form Alternating-Time Temporal Epistemic Logic [16]. Goranko and van Drimmelen [17] gave a complete axiomatization of ATL. Decidability and model checking problems for ATL-like systems has also been widely studied [18], [19], [20].</paragraph><paragraph>Ågotnes and Alechina proposed a complete logical system that combines the coalition power and epistemic modalities [21]. Since this system does not have epistemic requirements on strategies, it does not contain any axioms describing the interplay of these modalities. In the extended version of this work they added a complete axiomatization of an interplay between knowledge and know-how modalities [22].</paragraph><paragraph>Know-how strategies were studied before under different names. While Jamroga and Ågotnes talked about “knowledge to identify and execute a strategy” [23], Jamroga and van der Hoek discussed “difference between an agent knowing that he has a suitable strategy and knowing the strategy itself” [24]. Van Benthem called such strategies “uniform” [25]. Wang gave a complete axiomatization of “knowing how” as a binary modality [26], [27], but his logical system does not include the knowledge modality.</paragraph><paragraph>In [28], we investigated coalition strategies to enforce a condition indefinitely. Such strategies are similar to “goal maintenance” strategies in Pauly's “extended coalition logic” [5, p. 80]. We focused on “executable” and “verifiable” strategies. Using the language of the current article, executability means that a coalition remains “in the know-how” throughout the execution of the strategy. Verifiability means that the coalition can verify that the enforced condition remains true. In the notations of the current article, the existence of a verifiable strategy could be expressed as {a mathematical formula}SCKCφ. In [28], we provided a complete logical system that describes the interplay between the modality representing the existence of an “executable” and “verifiable” coalition strategy to enforce and the modality representing knowledge. This system can prove principles similar to the strategic positive introspection (3) and the strategic negative introspection (4) mentioned above. A similar complete logical system in a single-agent setting for strategies to achieve a goal in multiple steps rather than to maintain a goal is developed by Fervari, Herzig, Li, and Wang [29]. In a more recent work, we described the interplay between modalities {a mathematical formula}K and {a mathematical formula}H in the perfect recall setting in [30]. Properties of second-order know-how, when a coalition knows how another coalition can do it, are discussed in [31].</paragraph><paragraph>In the current article, we combine know-how modality {a mathematical formula}H with strategic modality {a mathematical formula}S and epistemic modality {a mathematical formula}K. In other words, we combine two separate logical systems given in [22]: one for knowledge and coalition power modalities and the other for knowledge and know-how modalities, into a single logical system. While doing this, we generalize the setting from the individual knowledge to the distributive knowledge and discover a new axiom, epistemic determinicity principle, not present in [22]. The proof of the completeness theorem in the current article is significantly more challenging than those in [22], [28], [29]. It employs new techniques that construct pairs of maximal consistent sets in “harmony” and in “complete harmony”. See Section 6.3 and Section 6.4 for details. An extended abstract of this article, without proofs, appeared as [32].</paragraph></section><section label="1.8"><section-title>Outline</section-title><paragraph>This article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce formal syntax and semantics of our logical system. In Section 3 we list axioms and inference rules of the system. Section 4 provides examples of formal proofs in our logical systems. Proofs of the soundness and the completeness are given in Section 5 and Section 6 respectively. Section 7 concludes the article.</paragraph><paragraph>The key part of the proof of the completeness is the construction of a pair of sets in complete harmony. We discuss the intuition behind this construction and introduce the notion of harmony in Section 6.3. The notion of complete harmony is introduced in Section 6.4.</paragraph></section></section><section label="2"><section-title>Syntax and semantics</section-title><paragraph>In this section we present the formal syntax and semantics of our logical system given a fixed finite set of agents {a mathematical formula}A. Epistemic transition system could be thought of as a Kripke model of modal logic S5 with distributed knowledge to which we add transitions controlled by a vote aggregation mechanism. Examples of vote aggregation mechanisms that we have considered in the introduction are the consensus/default mechanism and the majority vote mechanism. Unlike the introductory examples, in the general definition below we assume that at different states the mechanism might use different rules for vote aggregation. The only restriction on the mechanism that we introduce is that there should be at least one possible transition that the system can take no matter what the votes are. In other words, we assume that the system can never halt.</paragraph><paragraph>For any set of votes V, by {a mathematical formula}VA we mean the set of all functions from set {a mathematical formula}A to set V. Alternatively, the set {a mathematical formula}VA could be thought of as a set of tuples of elements of V indexed by elements of {a mathematical formula}A.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 1">A tuple {a mathematical formula}(W,{∼a}a∈A,V,M,π) is called an epistemic transition system, where</paragraph><list><list-item label="1.">W is a set of epistemic states,</list-item><list-item label="2.">{a mathematical formula}∼a is an indistinguishability equivalence relation on W for each {a mathematical formula}a∈A,</list-item><list-item label="3.">V is a nonempty set called “domain of choices”,</list-item><list-item label="4.">{a mathematical formula}M⊆W×VA×W is an aggregation mechanism where for each {a mathematical formula}w∈W and each {a mathematical formula}s∈VA, there is {a mathematical formula}w′∈W such that {a mathematical formula}(w,s,w′)∈M,</list-item><list-item label="5.">π is a function that maps propositional variables into subsets of W.</list-item></list><paragraph>Epistemic transition systems are very similar to concurrent game structures, the semantics of ATL [15], with two notable differences. First, in concurrent game structures, the domain of choices depends on the state and on the agent. On the other hand, we assume a uniform domain of choices for all states and all agents. This difference is insignificant because all domains of choices in a concurrent game structure could be replaced with their union if the aggregation mechanism is modified to interpret the additional choices as alternative names for the original choices. Second, unlike the transition function in the concurrent game structures, our aggregation mechanism allows to capture nondeterministic transitions. This difference is significant because restricting semantics to only deterministic transitions would require additional axioms. For example, property {a mathematical formula}SAφ∨SA¬φ, where {a mathematical formula}A is the coalition of all agents, is universally true in deterministic epistemic transition systems, but is not true in some nondeterministic systems.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 2">A coalition is a subset of {a mathematical formula}A.</paragraph><paragraph>Note that a coalition is always finite due to our assumption that the set of all agents {a mathematical formula}A is finite. Informally, we say that two epistemic states are indistinguishable by a coalition C if they are indistinguishable by every member of the coalition. Formally, coalition indistinguishability is defined as follows:</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 3">For any epistemic states {a mathematical formula}w1,w2∈W and any coalition C, let {a mathematical formula}w1∼Cw2 if {a mathematical formula}w1∼aw2 for each agent {a mathematical formula}a∈C.</paragraph><paragraph label="Corollary 1">Relation{a mathematical formula}∼Cis an equivalence relation on the set of states W for each coalition C.</paragraph><paragraph>By a strategy profile {a mathematical formula}{sa}a∈C of a coalition C we mean a tuple that specifies vote {a mathematical formula}sa∈V of each member {a mathematical formula}a∈C. Since such a tuple can also be viewed as a function from set C to set V, we denote the set of all strategy profiles of a coalition C by {a mathematical formula}VC:</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 4">Any tuple {a mathematical formula}{sa}a∈C∈VC is called a strategy profile of coalition C.</paragraph><paragraph>In addition to a fixed finite set of agents {a mathematical formula}A we also assume a fixed countable set of propositional variables. We use the assumption that this set is countable in the proof of Lemma 21. The language Φ of our formal logical system is specified in the next definition.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 5">Let Φ be the minimal set of formulae such that</paragraph><list><list-item label="1.">{a mathematical formula}p∈Φ for each propositional variable p,</list-item><list-item label="2.">{a mathematical formula}¬φ,φ→ψ∈Φ for all formulae {a mathematical formula}φ,ψ∈Φ,</list-item><list-item label="3.">{a mathematical formula}KCφ,SCφ,HCφ∈Φ for each coalition C and each {a mathematical formula}φ∈Φ.</list-item></list><paragraph>In other words, language Φ is defined by the following grammar:{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>By ⊥ we denote the negation of a tautology.

It is sometimes convenient to consider transitions that are consistent with a given strategy profile s of a given coalition {a mathematical formula}C⊆A. We write {a mathematical formula}w→su if a transition from state w to state u is consistent with strategy profile s. The formal definition is below.</paragraph><paragraph label="Corollary 2">For any epistemic states {a mathematical formula}w,u∈W, any coalition C, and any strategy profile {a mathematical formula}s={sa}a∈C∈VC, we write {a mathematical formula}w→su if {a mathematical formula}(w,s′,u)∈M for some strategy profile {a mathematical formula}s′={sa′}a∈A∈VA such that {a mathematical formula}sa′=sa for each {a mathematical formula}a∈C.Letsbe the unique strategy profile of the empty coalition ∅, if there are a coalition C and a strategy profile{a mathematical formula}s′of coalition C such that{a mathematical formula}w→s′u, then{a mathematical formula}w→su.</paragraph><paragraph>The next definition is the key definition of this article.

That is, the strategy s should work in all states indistinguishable from the current state w by the whole coalition. Informally, it means that we require the whole coalition C to know distributively that strategy s will succeed. Alternatively, one might require this to be known to each individual member of this coalition C. In the latter case, item 6 of Definition 7 would be stated as</paragraph><list><list-item label="6.′">{a mathematical formula}w⊩HCφ when there is a strategy profile {a mathematical formula}s∈VC such that for each {a mathematical formula}a∈C, each {a mathematical formula}w′∈W and each {a mathematical formula}w″∈W, if {a mathematical formula}w∼aw′ and {a mathematical formula}w′→sw″, then {a mathematical formula}w″⊩φ.</list-item></list><paragraph> This alternative, individual knowledge-based, definition of coalition know-how is used in logic ATL{sup:⁎}[33].

We refer to set X as maximal consistent if it is maximal among consistent subsets of Φ. The proof of the completeness consists in constructing a canonical model in which states are maximal consistent sets. This is a standard technique in modal logic that we modified significantly to work in the setting of our logical system. The standard way to apply this technique to a modal operator □ is to create a “child” state {a mathematical formula}w′ such that {a mathematical formula}¬ψ∈w′ for each “parent” state w where {a mathematical formula}¬□ψ∈w. In the simplest case when □ is a distributed knowledge modality {a mathematical formula}KC, the standard technique requires no modification and the construction of a “child” state is based on the following lemma:</paragraph><paragraph label="Proof">For any consistent set of formulae X, any formula{a mathematical formula}¬KCψ∈X, and any formulae{a mathematical formula}KCφ1,…,KCφn∈X, the set of formulae{a mathematical formula}{¬ψ,φ1,…,φn}is consistent.Assume the opposite.

Child {a mathematical formula}w′ is a state of the system indistinguishable from state w by coalition C.

Thus, the set of all formulae Φ is also countable. Let {a mathematical formula}φ1,φ2,… be an enumeration of all formulae in Φ.

This approach, however, does not work directly in the case of distributed knowledge version of S5. Indeed, in the latter case, if {a mathematical formula}s1∼as2 and {a mathematical formula}s1∼bs2, then we need sets {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2 to share not only formulae of the form {a mathematical formula}Kaφ and of the form {a mathematical formula}Kbφ, but also of the form {a mathematical formula}K{a,b}φ. A naïve way to achieve this is to require states {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2 to share formulae of form {a mathematical formula}K{a,b}φ each time when need {a mathematical formula}s1∼as2 and {a mathematical formula}s1∼bs2 both to be true. To achieve this, we define a canonical model, called the canonical epistemic transition system, as a graph whose nodes are labeled with maximal consistent sets and whose edges are labeled with coalitions. If nodes {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2 are connected by an edge labeled with coalition C, then we require maximal consistent sets associated with nodes {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2 to share all formulae of the form {a mathematical formula}KDφ, where {a mathematical formula}D⊆C. In fact, as we will see later, it suffices just to share formulae of the form {a mathematical formula}KCφ.</paragraph><paragraph>Note, however, that the graph construction does not solve our problems completely. Indeed, let us suppose that the graph, see Fig. 10, in addition to nodes {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2, has nodes u and v such that edges {a mathematical formula}(s1,u) and {a mathematical formula}(u,s2) are labeled with single-element coalition {a mathematical formula}{a} and edges {a mathematical formula}(s1,v) and {a mathematical formula}(v,s2) are labeled with single-element coalition {a mathematical formula}{b}. Thus, on one hand sets {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2 share {a mathematical formula}Kaφ formulae (through set u) and {a mathematical formula}Kbφ formulae (through state v), but they do not, generally speaking, share formulae of the form {a mathematical formula}K{a,b}φ. On the other hand, we need them to share formulae {a mathematical formula}K{a,b}φ because {a mathematical formula}s1∼as2 and {a mathematical formula}s1∼bs2. More generally, such a situation happens if the graph has two distinctive paths between nodes {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2: edges along one path are labeled with coalitions containing agent a and edges along the other path are labeled with coalitions containing agent b. To avoid this situation, it suffices to guarantee that the canonical models use trees instead of arbitrary graphs. We achieve this by adopting the “unravelling” technique [34].</paragraph><paragraph>Although in the informal discussion above we talked about states as the nodes of the tree, in the “unravelling” construction it is mathematically more elegant to assume that states are paths that lead to the node from the root of the tree. For the sake of simplicity, we still like to informally think about states as the nodes.

Informally, a vote {a mathematical formula}(φ,w) of each agent consists of two components: the actual vote φ and a key w. The actual vote φ is a formula from Φ in support of what the agent votes. Recall that the agent does not know in which exact state the system is, she only knows the equivalence class of this state with respect to the indistinguishability relation. The key w is the agent's guess of the epistemic state where the system is. Informally, agent's vote has more power to force the formula to be satisfied in the next state if she guesses the current state correctly.</paragraph><paragraph>Although each agent is free to vote for any formula she likes, the vote aggregation mechanism would grant agent's wish only under certain circumstances. Namely, if the system is in state w and set {a mathematical formula}hd(w) contains formula {a mathematical formula}SCφ, then the mechanism guarantees that formula φ is satisfied in the next state as long as each member of coalition C votes for formula φ and correctly guesses the current epistemic state. In other words, in order for formula φ to be guaranteed in the next state all members of the coalition C must cast vote {a mathematical formula}(φ,w). This means that if {a mathematical formula}SCφ∈hd(w), then coalition C has a strategy to force φ in the next state. Since the strategy requires each member of the coalition to guess correctly the current state, such a strategy is not a know-how strategy.</paragraph><paragraph>The vote aggregation mechanism is more forgiving if the epistemic state w contains formula {a mathematical formula}HCφ. In this case the mechanism guarantees that formula φ is satisfied in the next state if all members of the coalition vote for formula φ; it does not matter if they guess the current state correctly or not. This means that if {a mathematical formula}HCφ∈hd(w), then coalition C has a know-how strategy to force φ in the next state.

This article is an extended version of our previous conference paper [32], which contained the same results, but did not include the proofs of the soundness and the completeness. The completeness proof is significantly different from standard proofs of completeness in modal logic because of the peculiarity of know-how modality {a mathematical formula}H. According to item 6 of Definition 7, if {a mathematical formula}w⊮HCφ, then there are two epistemic states {a mathematical formula}w′ and {a mathematical formula}w″ that satisfy curtain conditions (while in the case of S5 and most of other standard modal logics, only one state {a mathematical formula}w′ is required in a similar situation). Furthermore, the states {a mathematical formula}w′ and {a mathematical formula}w″ had to be constructed simultaneously because of the inter-dependency between them imposed by Definition 7. To achieve this, we developed a new technique that we call “harmony”. This technique is one of the main contributions of this article. In our upcoming paper [31], this technique is adapted and refined for second-order know-how strategies.</paragraph><paragraph>In the future work we hope to explore know-how strategies of nonhomogeneous coalitions in which different members contribute differently to the goals of the coalition. For example, “incognito” members of a coalition might contribute only by sharing information, while “open” members also contribute by voting. It would also be interesting to investigate the computational complexity of this logic and alternative inference frameworks such as modal and description logics to design tableau algorithms for automated reasoning. Another direction may be the consideration of different types of coalition knowledge, such as common knowledge. Finally, one could study the interplay of knowledge and coalition power in a logic where strategies are first class citizen.</paragraph><section-title>Acknowledgement</section-title></section></content><acknowledgements><paragraph>We thank the reviewers for their insightful comments that greatly improved the quality of this article.</paragraph></acknowledgements><references><reference label="[1]"><authors>R.
