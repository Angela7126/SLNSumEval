Our goal is to pick a set of K items that maximize the total derived utility of all the agents (i.e., in our example we are to pick K movies that we put on the plane's entertainment system). However, the actual utility that an agent derives from a given item is only a fraction of its intrinsic one, and this fraction depends on how the agent ranks the item among the chosen, available, ones. We provide a formal specification of the model and provide concrete examples and settings where it is applicable.

Examples of such activities include picking a set of movies to put on a plane's entertainment system, deciding which journals a university library should subscribe to, deciding what common facilities to build, or even voting for a parliament (or other assembly of representatives). Let us consider some common features of these examples.</paragraph><paragraph>First, there is a set of items{sup:1} and a set of agents; each agent has some intrinsic utility for each of the items (e.g., this utility can be the level of appreciation for a movie, the average number of articles one reads from a given issue of a journal, expected benefit from building a particular facility, the feeling—measured in some way—of being represented by a particular politician).</paragraph><paragraph>Second, typically it is not possible to provide all the items to the agents and we can only pick some K of them, say (a plane's entertainment system fits only a handful of movies, the library has a limited budget, only several sites for the facilities are available, the parliament has a fixed size).</paragraph><paragraph>Third, the intrinsic utilities for items extend to the sets of items in such a way that the utility derived by an agent from a given item may depend on the rank of this item (from the agent's point of view) among the selected ones. Extreme examples include the case where each agent derives utility from his or her most preferred item only (e.g., an agent will watch his or her favorite movie only, will read/use the favorite journal/favorite facility only, will feel represented by the most appropriate politician only), from his or her least preferred item only (say, the agent worries that the family will force him or her to watch the worst available movie), or derives {a mathematical formula}1/K of the utility from each of the available items (e.g., the agent chooses the item—say, a movie—at random). However, in practice one should expect much more complicated schemes (e.g., an agent watches the top movie certainly, the second one probably, the third one perhaps, etc.; or, an agent is interested in having at least some T interesting journals in the library; an agent feels represented by some top T members of the parliament, etc.).</paragraph><paragraph>The goal of this paper is to formally define a model that captures all the above-described scenarios, provide a set of examples where the model is applicable, and provide an initial set of computational results for it in terms of efficient algorithms (exact or approximate) and computational hardness results (NP-hardness and inapproximability results).</paragraph><paragraph>Our work builds upon, generalizes, and extends quite a number of settings that have already been studied in the literature. We provide a deeper overview of this research in Section 8 and here we only mention the two most directly related lines of work. First, our model where the agents derive utility from their most preferred item among the selected ones directly corresponds to winner determination under the Chamberlin–Courant's voting rule [18], [50], [7] (it is also very deeply connected to the model of budgeted social choice [41], [49], [42]) and is in a certain formal sense a variant of the facility location problem. Second, the case where for each item each agent derives the same fraction of the utility is, in essence, the same as K-winner range-voting (or K-winner Borda [21]); that agents enjoy equally the items they get is also a key assumption in the Santa Claus problem [6], and in the problem of designing optimal picking sequences [14], [10], [35].</paragraph><paragraph>The paper is organized as follows. First, in Section 2 we discuss several important modeling choices and provide the formal description of our model. Then, in Section 3, we discuss the applicability of the model in various scenarios. Specifically, we show a number of examples that lead to particular parameter values of our model. We give an overview of our results in Section 4 and then, in Sections 5, 6, and 7, we present these results formally. In Section 5 we present results regarding the complexity of computing exact solutions for our model. In the next two sections we discuss the issue of computing approximate solutions. First without putting restrictions on agents' utilities (Section 6) and, then, for what we call non-finicky utilities (Section 7). Intuitively put, under non-finicky utilities the agents are required to give relatively high utility values to a relatively large fraction of the items. We believe that the notion of non-finicky utilities is one of the important contributions of this paper. We discuss related work in Section 8 and conclude in Section 9.</paragraph></section><section label="2"><section-title>The model</section-title><paragraph>In this section we give a formal description of our model. However, before we move on to the mathematical details, let us explain and justify some high-level assumptions and choices that we have made.</paragraph><paragraph>First, we assume that the agents have separable preferences. This means that the intrinsic utility of an object does not depend on what other objects are selected. This is very different from, for example, the case of combinatorial auctions. However, in our model the impact of an object on the global utility of an agent does depend on its rank (according to that agent) among the selected items. This distinction between the intrinsic value of an item and its value distorted by its rank is also considered in several other research fields, especially in decision theory (where it is known as “rank-dependent utility theory”) and in multicriteria decision making, from which we borrow one of the main ingredients of our approach, the ordered weighted average (OWA) operators[58] (for technical details see the work of Kacprzyk et al. [34]). OWAs were recently used in social choice in several contexts [31], [3], [23]; we discuss these works in detain in Section 8.</paragraph><paragraph>Second, throughout the paper we navigate between two views of the agents' intrinsic utilities:</paragraph><list><list-item label="1.">Generally, we assume that the utilities are provided explicitly in the input as numerical values, and that these values are comparable between agents. Yet, we make no further assumptions about the nature of agents' utilities: they do not need to be normalized, they do not need to come from any particular range of values, etc. Indeed, it is possible that some agent has very strong preferences regarding the items, modeled through high, diverse utility values, whereas some other agent does not care much about the selection process and has low utility values only.</list-item><list-item label="2.">In some parts of the paper (which will always be clearly identified), we assume that utilities are heavily constrained and are derived from non-numerical information, such as approval ballots specifying which items an agent approves (leading to approval-based utilities), or rankings over alternatives, from which utilities are derived using an agent-independent scoring vector (typically, a Borda-like vector).</list-item></list><paragraph> Formally, the latter view is a special case of the former, but we believe that it is worthwhile to consider it separately. Indeed, many multiwinner voting rules (such as the Chamberlin–Courant [18] rule or the Proportional Approval Voting rule [37]) fit the second view far more naturally, whereas for other applications the former view is more natural.</paragraph><paragraph>Third, we take the utilitarian view and measure the social welfare of the agents as the sum of their perceived utilities. One could study other variants, such as the egalitarian variant, where the social welfare is measured as the utility of the worst-off agent. We leave this as possible future research (our preliminary attempts indicated that the egalitarian setting is computationally even harder than the utilitarian one). Very recently, Elkind and Ismaïli [23] used OWA operators to define variants of the Chamberlin–Courant rule that lay between the utilitarian and egalitarian variants, while Amanatidis et al. [3] studied the same approach for a family of multiwinner voting rules based on Hamming distances; we discuss these works in more detail in Section 8. We believe that extending our setting beyond the utilitarian approach (e.g., by following the ideas of Elkind and Ismaïli [23] and Amanatidis et al. [3]) would be very interesting (but also rather challenging).</paragraph><section label="2.1"><section-title>The formal setting</section-title><paragraph>Let {a mathematical formula}N=[n] be a set of n agents and let {a mathematical formula}A={a1,…,am} be a set of m items. The goal is to pick a size-K set W of items that, in some sense, is most satisfying for the agents. To this end, (1) for each agent {a mathematical formula}i∈N and for each item {a mathematical formula}aj∈A we have an intrinsic utility {a mathematical formula}ui,aj≥0 that agent i derives from {a mathematical formula}aj; (2) the utility that each agent derives from a set of K items is an ordered weighted average [58] of this agent's intrinsic utilities for these items.</paragraph><paragraph>A weighted ordered average (OWA) operator over K numbers is a function defined through a vector {a mathematical formula}α(K)=〈α1,…,αK〉 of K (nonnegative) numbers{sup:2} as follows. Let {a mathematical formula}x→=〈x1,…,xK〉 be a vector of K numbers and let {a mathematical formula}x→↓=〈x1↓,…,xK↓〉 be the nonincreasing rearrangement of {a mathematical formula}x→, that is, {a mathematical formula}xi↓=xσ(i), where σ is a permutation of {a mathematical formula}{1,…,K} such that {a mathematical formula}xσ(1)≥xσ(2)≥…≥xσ(K). Then we set:{a mathematical formula} To make the notation lighter, we write {a mathematical formula}α(K)(x1,…,xK), instead of {a mathematical formula}OWAα(K)(x1,…,xK).</paragraph><paragraph>We provide a more detailed discussion of the OWA operators useful in our context later and here we only mention that, for example, they can be used to express the arithmetic average (through the size-K vector {a mathematical formula}(1K,…,1K)), the maximum and minimum operators (through vectors {a mathematical formula}(1,0,…,0), and {a mathematical formula}(0,…,0,1), respectively), and the median operator (through the vector of all zeros, with a single one in the middle position).</paragraph><paragraph>We formalize our problem of computing “the most satisfying set of K items” as follows.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 1">In the OWA-Winner problem we are given a set {a mathematical formula}N=[n] of agents, a set {a mathematical formula}A={a1,…,am} of items, a collection of agent's utilities {a mathematical formula}(ui,aj)i∈[n],aj∈A, a positive integer K ({a mathematical formula}K≤m), and a K-number OWA {a mathematical formula}α(K). The task is to compute a subset {a mathematical formula}W={w1,…,wK} of A such that {a mathematical formula}uutα(K)(W)=∑i=1nα(K)(ui,w1,…,ui,wK) is maximal.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 1">Consider six agents with the following utilities over the items from the set {a mathematical formula}A={a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6}:{a mathematical formula} Note that Agents 1, 2, and 3 have the same utilities for all the items. The same holds for Agents 4 and 5. We want to select {a mathematical formula}K=3 items and we use OWA {a mathematical formula}α=(2,1,0). What is the score of {a mathematical formula}{a1,a2,a6}? The first three agents get utility {a mathematical formula}2×5+4=14 each, the next two get {a mathematical formula}2×5+4=14 each, and the last one gets {a mathematical formula}2×3+1=7. So, the score of {a mathematical formula}{a1,a2,a6} is {a mathematical formula}42+28+7=77. Indeed, this is the optimal set; the next best ones are {a mathematical formula}{a1,a2,a4}, {a mathematical formula}{a1,a2,a5} and {a mathematical formula}{a1,a5,a6}, all with score 75. The rule defined by the OWA {a mathematical formula}α′=(1,1,1), known as 3-Borda (due to the very specific values of agents' utilities; see Example 2 in the next section), would choose {a mathematical formula}{a1,a2,a3} and Chamberlin–Courant's rule (in our terms, the rule defined by the OWA operator {a mathematical formula}α″=(1,0,0)) would choose {a mathematical formula}{a1,a5,a6}.</paragraph><paragraph>For a family {a mathematical formula}(α(K))K=1∞ of OWAs, we write α-OWA-Winner to denote the variant of the problem where for each given solution size K we use OWA {a mathematical formula}α(K). From now on we will not mention the sizes of the OWA vectors explicitly and they will always be clear from the context. We implicitly assume that OWAs in our families are polynomial-time computable with respect to K. (In the formal definition of our problem, different OWA-vectors can be used for different values of the parameter K and, consequently, the coefficients of the OWA vectors are not simply constants but rather are functions of K. For this reason we need the assumption about polynomial-time computability.)</paragraph></section><section label="2.2"><section-title>Classes of intrinsic utilities</section-title><paragraph>While our general setting allows agents to express arbitrary utilities, we also focus on two cases where they only provide approval-based or ordinal information: Approval-based information.Agents provide approval-based information if they only have to specify which items they like. This information is then mapped into approval-based utilities, defined by {a mathematical formula}ui(aj)=1 if i likes {a mathematical formula}aj and {a mathematical formula}ui(aj)=0 otherwise.Ordinal information.Agents provide ordinal information if they only have to specify their rankings over items, called their preference orders. This information is then mapped into utilities using a scoring vector, exactly in the same way as positional scoring rules (for single-winner voting) do. We focus on the particular case where this scoring vector is the Borda vector, i.e., if the rank of {a mathematical formula}aj in i's ranking is k then {a mathematical formula}ui(aj)=m−k. We refer to this setting as Borda-based utilities. Naturally, these are special cases of our general setting. Yet using approval-based or Borda-based utilities can be more convenient than using the general approach.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 2">The utilities of the agents from Example 1 are Borda-based and can be expressed as the following preference orders:{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>Both approval-based utilities and Borda-based utilities are inspired by analogous notions from the theory of voting, where approval and Borda count are very well-known single-winner voting rules (briefly put, under these rules we treat the utilities of the items as their scores, sum up the scores assigned to the items by the voters, and elect the item that has the highest score). Further, Borda-based utilities have been used in the original Chamberlin–Courant's rule and in several works on fair division (see, e.g., a paper of Brams and King [13]).</paragraph><paragraph>One of the high-level messages of this paper is that OWA-Winner problems tend to be computationally easier for the case of Borda-based utilities than for the case of approval-based ones (while we typically obtain NP-hardness in both settings, we find good approximation algorithms for many of the Borda-based cases, whereas for the approval-based setting our algorithms are either significantly weaker or we obtain outright inapproximability results). This is so mostly because under Borda-based utilities all the agents assign relatively high utility values to a relatively large fraction of items. In the following definition we try to capture this property.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 2">Consider a setting with m items and let {a mathematical formula}umax denote the highest utility that some agent gives to an item. Let β and γ be two numbers in {a mathematical formula}[0,1]. We say that the agents have (β, γ)-non-finicky utilities if every agent has utility at least {a mathematical formula}βumax for at least γm items.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 3">To understand this notion better, let us consider the following example. Let {a mathematical formula}n=3 and {a mathematical formula}m=6. The utilities are as defined below:{a mathematical formula} The agents have {a mathematical formula}(0.8,0.5)-non-finicky utilities. Indeed, all there agents have utility at least 8 for at least half of the items. They also have {a mathematical formula}(0.6,23)-non-finicky utilities, and {a mathematical formula}(0.5,56)-non-finicky utilities. We will also use the agents and items from this example later, when presenting our algorithms.</paragraph><paragraph>As we can expect, Borda-based utilities are non-finicky in a very natural sense.</paragraph><paragraph label="Observation 1">For every x,{a mathematical formula}0≤x≤1, Borda-based utilities are{a mathematical formula}(x,1−x)-non-finicky.</paragraph><paragraph>However there are also other natural cases of non-finicky utilities. For example, consider agents that have approval-based utilities and where each agent approves of at least a γ fraction of the items. These agents have {a mathematical formula}(1,γ)-non-finicky utilities. (The reader may be surprised here that approval-based utilities may be non-finicky even though we said that we obtain inapproximability results for them. Yet, there is no contradiction here. These inapproximability results rely on the fact that some agents approve of very few items.)</paragraph></section><section label="2.3"><section-title>A dictionary of useful OWA families</section-title><paragraph>Below we give a catalog of OWA families that we focus on throughout the paper (in the description below we take K to be the dimension of the vectors to which we apply a given OWA).</paragraph><list><list-item label="1.">k-Median OWA. For each {a mathematical formula}k∈{1,…,K}, {a mathematical formula}k-med(K) is the OWA defined by the vector of {a mathematical formula}k−1 zeros, followed by a single one, followed by {a mathematical formula}K−k zeros. It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}k-med(K)(x1,…,xK) is the k-th largest number in the set {a mathematical formula}{x1,…,xK} and is known as the k-median of {a mathematical formula}x→. In particular, {a mathematical formula}1-med(K)(x→) is the maximum operator, {a mathematical formula}K-med(K)(x→) is the minimum operator, and if K is odd, {a mathematical formula}K+12-med(K)(x→) is the median operator.</list-item><list-item label="2.">k-Best OWA. For each {a mathematical formula}k∈{1,…,K}, {a mathematical formula}k-best(K) OWA is defined through the vector of k ones followed by {a mathematical formula}K−k zeros. That is, {a mathematical formula}k-best(K)(x→) is the sum of the top k values in {a mathematical formula}x→ (with appropriate scaling, this means an arithmetic average of the top k numbers). {a mathematical formula}K-bestK(K) is simply the sum of all the numbers in {a mathematical formula}x→ (after scaling, the arithmetic average).</list-item><list-item label="3.">Arithmetic progression OWA. This OWA is defined through the vector {a mathematical formula}aprog[a](K)=〈a+(K−1)b,a+(K−2)b,…,a〉, where {a mathematical formula}a≥0 and {a mathematical formula}b&gt;0. (One can easily check that the choice of b has no impact on the outcome of OWA-Winner; this is not the case for a, though.)</list-item><list-item label="4.">Geometric progression OWA. This OWA is defined through the vector {a mathematical formula}gprog[p](K)=〈pK−1,pK−2,…,1〉, where {a mathematical formula}p&gt;1. (This is without loss of generality, because multiplying the vector by a constant factor has no impact on the outcome of OWA-Winner; but the choice of p matters.)</list-item><list-item label="5.">Harmonic OWA. This OWA is defined through the vector {a mathematical formula}〈1,12,13,…,1K〉,</list-item><list-item label="6.">Hurwicz OWA. This OWA is defined through a vector {a mathematical formula}(λ,0,…,0,1−λ), where λ, {a mathematical formula}0≤λ≤1, is a parameter.</list-item></list><paragraph>In the next section we describe several settings where these particular operators arise naturally. For other applications, one can easily design all sorts of other operators. As our natural assumption is that highly ranked items have more impact than lower-ranked objects, we often make the assumption that OWA vectors are nonincreasing, that is, {a mathematical formula}α1≥…≥αK. While most OWA operators we consider in the paper are indeed nonincreasing, this is not the case for k-medians (except for 1-median) and Hurwicz (except for {a mathematical formula}λ=1).</paragraph></section></section><section label="3"><section-title>Applications of the model</section-title><paragraph>We believe that our model is very general. To substantiate this claim, in this section we provide four quite different scenarios where it is applicable.</paragraph><paragraph>Generalizing voting rules. Our research started as an attempt to generalize the rule of Chamberlin and Courant [18] for electing sets of representatives. For this rule, the voters (the agents) have Borda-based utilities over a set of candidates and we wish to elect a K-member committee (e.g., a parliament), such that each voter is represented by one member of the committee. If we select K candidates, then a voter is “represented” by the selected candidate that she ranks highest among the chosen ones. Thus, winner determination under Chamberlin–Courant's voting rule boils down to solving {a mathematical formula}1-best-OWA-Winner for the case of Borda-based utilities. On the other hand, solving {a mathematical formula}K-best-OWA-Winner for Borda-based utilities is equivalent to finding winners under K-Borda, the rule that picks K candidates with the highest Borda scores (see the work of Elkind et al. [22] for a classification of multiwinner voting rules, including, e.g., K-Borda and Chamberlin–Courant's rule).</paragraph><paragraph>Our model extends one more appealing voting rule, known as Proportional Approval Voting (PAV; see the work of Kilgour [37] for a review of approval-based multiwinner rules, and the work of Aziz et al. [5] and Elkind and Lackner [24] for computational results). Winner determination under PAV is equivalent to solving α-OWA-Winner for the harmonic OWA, for the case of approval-based utilities.</paragraph><paragraph>More generally, our model is very related to that of committee scoring rules, recently introduced by Elkind et al. [22]. While technically the two models are not comparable, our work inspired Faliszewski et al. [26], [25] to consider the class of OWA-based committee scoring rules, which—in essence—are equivalent to the family of α-OWA-Winner problems for the case where the utilities are derived from ordinal data using single-winner scoring rules (analogously to our Borda-based utilities).</paragraph><paragraph>One of the high-level observations that follows from the works of Elkind et al. [22], Faliszewski et al. [26], [25], and Aziz et al. [4] is that different OWA operators lead to multiwinner voting rules with very different properties.</paragraph><paragraph>Malfunctioning items or unavailable candidates. Consider a setting where we pick the items off-line, but on-line it may turn out that some of them are unavailable (for example, we pick a set of journals the library subscribes to, but when an agent goes to a library, a particular journal could already be borrowed by someone else; see the work of Lu and Boutilier [40] for other examples of social choice with possibly unavailable candidates). If some of the items are unavailable, an agent chooses to use the best yet available one.</paragraph><paragraph>Let us make some additional assumptions about the scenario. We assume that each item is available with the same, known probability p (i.i.d.). The utility an agent gets from a set of selected items W is the expected value of the best available object. If our goal is to select K items so that the expected utility of an average agent (chosen uniformly at random) from his or her best available item is maximized, we should use the OWA operator {a mathematical formula}〈p,p(1−p),p(1−p)2,…〉. The OWA coefficients give the probabilities that, respectively, the most desired item is available, the second most-desired item is available but the first one is not, the third most-desired item is available but the first two are not, and so on. We note that using this operator is equivalent to using an appropriate geometric OWA operator.</paragraph><paragraph>Since the probabilities used in this example are elements of the external world, it is natural to assume that they are known to the agents and that the agents could simply provide their utilities for all the possible bundles of K items. However, for large values of K this would require the agents to provide very large (possibly exponential) amount of information. The advantage of our model is that it provides a compact language for representing such agents' utilities (indeed, this is a general advantage of our model that also applies to the following two examples).</paragraph><paragraph>With similar motivations, Swamy and Shmoys [57] studied the facility location problem with facilities vulnerable to failures. Their approach corresponds to using {a mathematical formula}ℓ-best-OWA-Winner, for some constant ℓ (however their model is a bit different because they derive utilities from distances between the agents, whereas in our case the utilities can be arbitrary). An interesting open problem is to extend the approach of Swamy and Shmoys to other types of OWA vectors, in particular to the geometric progression OWA.</paragraph><paragraph>Uncertainty regarding how many items a user enjoys. There may be some uncertainty about the number of items a user would enjoy (e.g., on a plane, it is uncertain how many movies a passenger would watch; one might fall asleep or might only watch those movies that are good enough). We give two possible models for the choice of the OWA vectors (in both cases, for each i, the coefficient {a mathematical formula}αi of the OWA operator is proportional to the probability that an agent enjoys the i'th best movie):</paragraph><list><list-item label="1.">The probability that an agent enjoys i items, for {a mathematical formula}0≤i≤K, is uniformly distributed, i.e., an agent would enjoy exactly his or her first i items in W with probability {a mathematical formula}1K+1. So, the agent enjoys the i'th item if she enjoys at least i items, which occurs with probability {a mathematical formula}K−i+1K+1; we should use OWA vector defined by {a mathematical formula}αi=K−i+1 (we disregard the normalizing constant), i.e., an arithmetic progression.</list-item><list-item label="2.">We assume that the values given by each user to each item are distributed uniformly, i.i.d., on {a mathematical formula}[0,1] and that each user uses only the items that have a value at least θ, where θ is a fixed (user-independent) threshold. Therefore, a user enjoys the item in W ranked in position i if she values at least i items at least θ, which occurs with probability {a mathematical formula}∑j=iK(Ki)(1−θ)iθK−i, thus leading to the OWA vector defined by {a mathematical formula}αi=∑j=iK(Ki)(1−θ)iθK−i.</list-item></list><paragraph> There is a certain worry that we should address here. Our model requires us to use the same OWA operator for each agent, whereas different agents may enjoy different numbers of items with quite different probabilities. While the restriction to a common OWA operator for all the agents certainly is a limitation of the model, we believe that it is a justified one: On the one hand, even using a single operator is computationally very challenging (as we will see very soon) and, on the other hand, the two approaches presented here show reasonable choices for OWA operators that can apply to many similar scenarios (especially if obtaining the personalized OWA operators for the agents would be a challenge on its own). In our model, OWA operators represent typical expected behavior and not the specific behavior of each agent. (This is similar to using positional scoring vectors for voting rules, which express the typical relation—rather than the agent-specific relations—between utilities and positions in preference rankings.) Naturally, if one were not satisfied with OWAs derived theoretically (as in this example), one could find operators that are most suitable for a given population of agents and the application at hand using classical techniques from machine learning.</paragraph><paragraph>Ignorance about which item will be assigned to a user. We now assume that a matching mechanism will be used after selecting the K items. The matching mechanism is not specified; it might also be randomized. If the agents have a complete ignorance about the mechanism used, then it makes sense to use known criteria for decision-making under complete uncertainty (as opposed to the previous two scenarios where the coefficients of the OWA operators were appropriate probabilities, here these coefficients describe the agents' attitude toward risk):</paragraph><list><list-item label="1.">The Wald criterion assumes that agents are extremely risk-averse, and corresponds to {a mathematical formula}α=K-med(K)=〈0,…,0,1〉 (recall the definition of the k-median OWA from Section 2.3). The agents consider their worst possible items.</list-item><list-item label="2.">The Hurwicz criterion is a linear combination between the worst and the best outcomes, and corresponds to {a mathematical formula}α=(λ,0,…,0,1−λ) for some fixed {a mathematical formula}λ∈(0,1).</list-item></list><paragraph> If the agents know that they are guaranteed to get one of their best i items, then the Wald and Hurwicz criteria lead, respectively, to the OWAs {a mathematical formula}α=i-med(K) and {a mathematical formula}α=(λ,0,…,0,1−λ,0,…,0), with {a mathematical formula}1−λ in position i. If the agents know that the mechanism gives them one of their top i items, each with the same probability, then we should use {a mathematical formula}i-best OWA. More generally, the matching mechanism may assign items to agents with a probability that decreases when the rank increases.</paragraph><paragraph>Remarks. We conclude this section with a few comments regarding which parts of our model are endogenous and which are exogenous. From the computational point of view, all of them are exogenous. We are given the OWA operator, the agents, their intrinsic utilities, the value K, and our goal is to solve this OWA-Winner instance. However, the situation from the point of view of the designer of the mechanism who applies the model is quite different. For example, he or she may be able to specify the format in which the utilities are provided (e.g., he or she may require Borda-based utilities or approval-based utilities), or he or she may be forced to use a particular format (e.g., only approval-based utilities may be available). He or she may be able to choose the OWA operator (e.g., he or she may be designing a multiwinner voting rule for some society, trying to balance different desiderata), or the OWA operator might follow naturally from the external parameters (as in the example of malfunctioning items), or might be provided explicitly from the outside (e.g., as in the example of highly risk-averse agents).</paragraph><paragraph>In summary, what we provide is a language for expressing a large family of problems regarding the selection of items for collective use by the agents, and a number of tools for solving these problems (or for identifying which of these problems are difficult to solve).</paragraph></section><section label="4"><section-title>Overview of the results</section-title><paragraph>In this section we provide a high-level overview of our results. It turns out that computational properties of the OWA-Winner problem are quite varied and strongly depend on the types of OWA operators and the allowed agent utilities. We present a summary of our results in Table 1 (however, we stress that some of our technical results are not listed in the table and can be found only in the following sections).</paragraph><paragraph>Our first observation is that without any restrictions, OWA-Winner is NP-hard. This is hardly surprising since the problem generalizes other NP-hard problems, and it is natural to ask if there are any special cases where it is easy. Unfortunately, as we show in Section 5, they are very rare. For example, without restrictions on the agents' utilities, OWA-Winner can be solved in polynomial time either if we treat K as a constant or if we use the constant OWA vector (i.e., if we use {a mathematical formula}K-best OWA). Indeed, the problem becomes NP-hard already for the {a mathematical formula}(K−1)-best OWA. This holds even if the agents are restricted to have approval-based utilities (Theorem 6) or Borda-based utilities (Theorem 7). More generally, we show that OWA-Winner is NP-hard for every family of OWA vectors that are nonconstant and nonincreasing (Theorem 5), which captures a significant fraction of all interesting settings.</paragraph><paragraph>After considering the worst-case complexity of computing exact solutions in Section 5, in Section 6 we focus on the approximability of the OWA-Winner problem. We show that in this respect there is a significant difference between two main classes of OWA vectors, those that are nonincreasing and the remaining ones. We show that for the nonincreasing OWA vectors the standard greedy algorithm for optimizing submodular functions achieves approximation ratio of ({a mathematical formula}1−1/e), irrespective of the nature of the agents' utilities (Lemma 12 and Theorem 13). On the other hand, we present evidence that there is little hope for good approximation algorithms for the case of OWA vectors that are not nonincreasing (Example 5 and Theorem 15, Theorem 19).</paragraph><paragraph>Next, in Section 7, we consider approximation algorithms for OWA-Winner for the case where agents have non-finicky utilities. It turns out that for non-finicky utilities we can sometimes obtain much better approximability guarantees than in the general setting. The key feature of non-finicky utilities assumption is that every agent gives sufficiently high utility values to sufficiently many items, so that the algorithms have enough flexibility in picking the items to achieve high quality results. Specifically, we show a strong approximation algorithm for the case of non-finicky utilities and OWA vectors that concentrate most of the weight in a constant number of their top coefficients (Theorem 25, Theorem 29, Theorem 30, and Corollary 31). These results apply, for example, to the case of geometric progression OWAs, {a mathematical formula}ℓ-best OWAs, and {a mathematical formula}ℓ-med OWAs (for fixed values of ℓ). Further, when applied to the case of Borda-based utilities (which, as we have argued in Section 2.2, are non-finicky in a very strong sense), we obtain polynomial-time approximation schemes (that is, approximation algorithms that can compute solutions with an arbitrarily good precision, but whose running time depends polynomially only on the size of the problem but not necessarily on the desired approximation ratio).</paragraph></section><section label="5"><section-title>Computing exact solutions</section-title><paragraph>We start our analysis by discussing the complexity of solving the OWA-Winner problem exactly. In general, it seems that OWA-Winner is a rather difficult problem and below we show this section's main negative result. That is, we show that our problem is NP-hard for any class of OWA vectors satisfying a certain natural restriction. Intuitively, this restriction says that in a considered family of OWAs, the impact of more-liked items on the total satisfaction of an agent is greater than that of the less-liked ones.</paragraph><paragraph label="Theorem 3">Fix an OWA family α such that for every K,{a mathematical formula}α(K)is nonincreasing and nonconstant.{sup:3}α-OWA-Winneris NP-hard, even for approval-based utilities.</paragraph><paragraph>For the sake of readability, we first prove two simpler results that we later use in the proof of Theorem 3.

Let I be an instance of CubicVertexCover with graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E), where {a mathematical formula}V={v1,…,vm} and {a mathematical formula}E={e1,…,en}, and positive integer K. W.l.o.g., we assume that {a mathematical formula}n&gt;3.We construct an instance {a mathematical formula}I′ of α-OWA-Winner. In {a mathematical formula}I′ we set {a mathematical formula}N=E (the agents correspond to the edges), {a mathematical formula}A=V∪{b1,b2,…bp−1} (there are {a mathematical formula}(p−1) dummy items; other items correspond to the vertices), and we seek a collection of items of size {a mathematical formula}K+p−1. Each agent {a mathematical formula}ei, {a mathematical formula}ei∈E, has utility 1 exactly for all the dummy items and for two vertices that {a mathematical formula}ei connects and for each of the dummy items (for the remaining items {a mathematical formula}ei has utility 0). In effect, each agent has utility 1 for exactly {a mathematical formula}p+1 items.We claim that I is a yes-instance of CubicVertexCover if and only if there exists a solution for {a mathematical formula}I′ with the total utility at least {a mathematical formula}n∑i=1pαi+(3K−n)αp+1.{a mathematical formula}(⇒) If there is a vertex cover C of size K for G, then by selecting the items {a mathematical formula}W=C∪{b1,b2,…bp−1} we obtain the required utility of the agents. Indeed, for every agent {a mathematical formula}ei there are at least p items in W for which i gives value 1 (the {a mathematical formula}p−1 dummy items and at least one vertex incident to {a mathematical formula}ei). These items contribute the value {a mathematical formula}n∑i=1pαi to the total agents' utility. Additionally, since every non-dummy item has value 1 for exactly 3 agents, and since every agent has at most {a mathematical formula}(p+1) items with value 1, there are exactly {a mathematical formula}(3K−n) agents that have exactly {a mathematical formula}(p+1) items in W with values 1. These {a mathematical formula}(p+1)'th additional utility-1 items of the {a mathematical formula}(3k−n) agents contribute {a mathematical formula}(3K−n)αp+1 to the total utility. Altogether, the agents' utility is {a mathematical formula}n∑i=1pαi+(3K−n)αp+1, as claimed.{a mathematical formula}(⇐) Let us assume that there is a set of {a mathematical formula}(K+p−1) items with total utility at least {a mathematical formula}n∑i=1pαi+(3K−n)αp+1. In {a mathematical formula}I′ we have {a mathematical formula}(p−1) items that have value 1 for each of the n agents, and every other item has value 1 for exactly 3 agents. Thus, the sum of the utilities of {a mathematical formula}K+p−1 items (without applying the OWA operator yet) is at most {a mathematical formula}(p−1)n+3K=pn+(3K−n). Thus, the total utility of the agents (now applying the OWA operator) is {a mathematical formula}n∑i=1pαi+(3K−n)αp+1 only if for each agent {a mathematical formula}ei the solution contains p items with utility 1. Since there are only {a mathematical formula}p−1 dummy items, it means that for each agent {a mathematical formula}ei there is a vertex {a mathematical formula}vj in the solution such that {a mathematical formula}ej is incident to {a mathematical formula}vj. That is, I is a yes-instance of CubicVertexCover. □</paragraph><paragraph label="Theorem 6">{a mathematical formula}(K−1)-best-OWA-Winneris NP-complete even for approval-based utilities.</paragraph><paragraph label="Proof">Membership in NP is clear. We show a reduction from the VertexCover problem. Let I be an instance of VertexCover with graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E), where {a mathematical formula}V={v1,…,vm} and {a mathematical formula}E={e1,…,en}, and with a positive integer K (without loss of generality, we assume that {a mathematical formula}K≥3 and {a mathematical formula}K&lt;m).We construct an instance {a mathematical formula}I′ of {a mathematical formula}(K−1)-best-OWA-Winner in the following way. We let the set of items be {a mathematical formula}A=V and we form 2n agents, two for each edge. Specifically, if {a mathematical formula}ei is an edge connecting two vertices, call them {a mathematical formula}vi,1 and {a mathematical formula}vi,2, then we introduce two agents, {a mathematical formula}ei1 and {a mathematical formula}ei2, with the following utilities: {a mathematical formula}ei1 has utility 1 for {a mathematical formula}vi,1 and for {a mathematical formula}vi,2, and has utility 0 for all the other items; {a mathematical formula}ei2 has opposite utilities—it has utility 0 for {a mathematical formula}vi,1 and for {a mathematical formula}vi,2, and has utility 1 for all the remaining ones.Let W be some set of K items (i.e., vertices) and consider the sum of the utilities derived by the two agents {a mathematical formula}ei1 and {a mathematical formula}ei2 from W under {a mathematical formula}(K−1)-best-OWA. If neither {a mathematical formula}vi,1 nor {a mathematical formula}vi,2 belong to W, then the total utility of {a mathematical formula}ei1 and {a mathematical formula}ei2 is equal to {a mathematical formula}K−1 (the former agent gets utility 0 and the latter one gets {a mathematical formula}K−1). If only one of the items, i.e., either {a mathematical formula}vi,1 or {a mathematical formula}vi,2, belongs to W, then the total utility of {a mathematical formula}ei1 and {a mathematical formula}ei2 is equal to K (the former agent gets utility 1 and the latter one still gets {a mathematical formula}K−1). Finally, if both items {a mathematical formula}vi,1,vi,2 belong to W, then the total utility of {a mathematical formula}ei1 and {a mathematical formula}ei2 is also equal to K (the former gets utility 2 and the latter gets utility {a mathematical formula}K−2). Thus the total utility of all agents is equal to {a mathematical formula}K⋅n if and only if the answer to the instance I is “yes”. This shows that the reduction is correct and, since the reduction is computable in polynomial time, the proof is complete. □</paragraph><paragraph>Using a proof that combines the ideas of the proofs of Theorem 5, Theorem 6, we show that indeed OWA-Winner is NP-hard for a large class of natural OWAs.</paragraph><paragraph label="Proof of Theorem 3">We give a reduction from CubicVertexCover. Let I be an instance of CubicVertexCover with graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E), where {a mathematical formula}V={v1,…,vm} and {a mathematical formula}E={e1,…,en}, and with positive integer K.Now let us consider {a mathematical formula}α(2K). Since {a mathematical formula}α(2K) is nonincreasing and nonconstant, one of the two following conditions must hold.<list>There exists {a mathematical formula}p≤K such that {a mathematical formula}αp(2K)&gt;αp+1(2K).There exists {a mathematical formula}p&gt;K such that {a mathematical formula}αp(2K)&gt;αp+1(2K), and for every {a mathematical formula}p≤K, we have {a mathematical formula}αp(2K)=αp+1(2K).If (1) is the case then we use a reduction similar to that in the proof of </list><paragraph>Theorem 5. The only difference is that apart from the set {a mathematical formula}D1 of {a mathematical formula}(p−1) dummy items (ranked first by all agents), we introduce the set {a mathematical formula}D2 of {a mathematical formula}(2K−p+1) dummy items and {a mathematical formula}(2K−p+1) sets {a mathematical formula}N1,N2,…,N2K−p+1, each consisting of 2n dummy agents. The dummy items from {a mathematical formula}D2 are introduced only to fill-up the solution up to 2K members. The dummy agents from {a mathematical formula}Ni have utility 1 for each of the items from {a mathematical formula}D1 and for the i'th item from {a mathematical formula}D2 (they have utility 0 for all the other items). This is to enforce that the items from {a mathematical formula}D2 are selected in the optimal solution. The further part of the reduction is as in the proof of Theorem 5.If (2) is the case, then we use a reduction similar to that in the proof of Theorem 6. We let the set of items be {a mathematical formula}A=V∪D1∪D2, where {a mathematical formula}D1, {a mathematical formula}|D1|=p+1−K, and {a mathematical formula}D2, {a mathematical formula}|D2|=2K−p−1 are sets of dummy items that we need for our construction. Similarly as in the proof of Theorem 6, for each edge {a mathematical formula}ei∈E we introduce two agents {a mathematical formula}ei1 and {a mathematical formula}ei2. Here, however, we additionally need the set F of {a mathematical formula}(2n+1) dummy agents. Each dummy agent from F assigns utility 1 to each dummy item from {a mathematical formula}D2 and utility 0 to the remaining items—consequently, since {a mathematical formula}|F|&gt;2n, each dummy item from {a mathematical formula}D2 must be selected to every optimal solution. Further, each non-dummy agent assigns utility 1 to each dummy agent from {a mathematical formula}D1—this way we ensure that every item from {a mathematical formula}D1 must be selected to every optimal solution. Finally, the utilities of the non-dummy agents for the non-dummy items are defined exactly as in the proof of Theorem 6. This ensures that the optimal solution, apart from {a mathematical formula}D1 and {a mathematical formula}D2, will contain the non-dummy items that correspond to the vertices from the optimal vertex cover. □</paragraph></paragraph><paragraph>One may wonder if our just-presented hardness results also hold for other restrictions on agents' utilities. Below we show a variant of the result from Theorem 6 for Borda-based utilities.

We form an instance {a mathematical formula}I′ of k-best-OWA-Winner that is identical to I except that: (1) We add {a mathematical formula}k−1 special items {a mathematical formula}b1,…,bk−1 such that under approval-based utilities each agent i has utility 1 for each item {a mathematical formula}bj, {a mathematical formula}1≤j≤k−1, and under Borda-based utilities each agent i has utility {a mathematical formula}m+j−1 for item {a mathematical formula}bj, {a mathematical formula}1≤j≤k−1.

We leave this conjecture as a natural follow-up question. It is tempting to conjecture that for all families of non-constant OWAs, not just the natural ones, the problem is NP-hard. This, however, is not the case. By following the arguments of the classic theorem of Ladner [38], it is possible to exhibit a polynomial-time computable family of OWAs such that α-OWA-Winner is in NP, but is neither NP-complete nor in P, unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP.

Such rules are not only polynomially solvable, but also are easier to understand for the society. Further, Caragiannis et al. [17] and, later, Elkind et al. [22], advocate viewing approximation algorithms for computationally hard voting rules as new election systems, and study their axiomatic properties (often showing that they are better than those of the original rules).</paragraph><paragraph>Here we give another interesting observation. It turns out that the algorithm from Theorem 13, when applied to the case of approval-based utilities and the harmonic OWA, is simply the winner determination procedure for the Sequential Proportional Approval Voting rule [11] (developed by the Danish astronomer and mathematician Thorvald N. Thiele, and used for a short period in Sweden during early 1900s). That is, the Sequential Proportional Approval Voting rule is simply an approximation of the PAV rule (the Proportional Approval Voting rule). We believe that this observation gives another evidence that approximation algorithms for computationally hard voting rules can indeed be viewed as new full-fledged voting rules. (We point readers interested in approval-based multiwinner voting rules to the overview of Kilgour [37] and to the works of Aziz et al. [5], [4], Elkind and Lackner [24], and Skowron and Faliszewski [54]).</paragraph><paragraph>Is a {a mathematical formula}(1−1e)-approximation algorithm a good result? After all, {a mathematical formula}1−1e≈0.63 and so the algorithm guarantees only about 63% of the maximum possible satisfaction for the agents. Irrespective if one views it as sufficient or not, this is the best possible approximation ratio of a polynomial-time algorithm for (unrestricted) OWA-Winner with a nonincreasing OWA. The reason is that 1-best-OWA-Winner with approval-based utilities is, in essence, another name for the MaxCover problem, and if {a mathematical formula}P≠NP, then {a mathematical formula}(1−1e) is approximation upper bound for MaxCover[27]. We omit the exact details of the connection between MaxCover and 1-best-OWA-Winner and instead we point the readers to the work of Skowron and Faliszewski [54] who discuss this point in detail (we mention that they refer to what we call 1-best-OWA-Winner as winner determination for Chamberlin–Courant's voting rule).</paragraph><paragraph>For OWAs that are not nonincreasing, it seems that we cannot even hope for a {a mathematical formula}(1−1e)-approximation algorithm. There are two arguments to support this belief. First, such OWAs yield utility functions that are not necessarily submodular and, so, it is impossible to apply the result of Nemhauser et al. [46]. As an example, we show that 2-med-OWA yields a utility function that is not submodular.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 5">Let us consider a single agent, two sets of items {a mathematical formula}W={c,d} and {a mathematical formula}W′={b,c,d} (of course {a mathematical formula}W⊂W′), and {a mathematical formula}2-med-OWA α. The utilities of the agent over the items a, b, c, and d are equal to 10, 9, 2, and 1, respectively. We get:{a mathematical formula} That is, {a mathematical formula}uutα is not submodular. Indeed, this example works even for approval-based utilities: it suffices to set the utilities for a and b to be 1, and for c and d to be 0.</paragraph><paragraph>Second, it is quite plausible that there are no constant-factor approximation algorithms for many not-nonincreasing OWAs. As an example, let us consider the case of families of OWAs with the following structure: their first entries are zeros followed by some nonzero entry at a sufficiently early position. If there were a good approximation algorithm for winner determination under such OWAs, then there would be a good approximation algorithm for the Densest-K-Subgraph problem, which seems unlikely.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 14">In a Densest-k-Subgraph problem we are given an undirected graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) and a positive integer K.

Let α be a family of OWAs such that each OWA in the family (for at least ℓ numbers) has 0s on positions 1 through{a mathematical formula}ℓ−1, and has a nonzero value on the ℓ'th position. If there is a polynomial-time{a mathematical formula}x(n)-approximation algorithm for α-OWA-Winnerthen there is a polynomial-time{a mathematical formula}x(n)-approximation algorithm for theDensest-k-Subgraphproblem.</paragraph><paragraph>We should mention that Theorem 15 holds for a somewhat more general class of OWAs than stated explicitly. The proof relies on the fact that the first entry of the OWA is zero and that after the first non-zero entry of the OWA there are still {a mathematical formula}K−1 positions, where K is the parameter from the input Densest-K-Subset instance.</paragraph><paragraph label="Proof of Theorem 15">Let I be an instance of the Densest-K-Subgraph problem with graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) and positive integer K. From I we construct an instance {a mathematical formula}I′ of α-OWA-Winner, where the set of agents N is E, the set of items is {a mathematical formula}A=V∪{d1,…,dℓ−2} (or V if {a mathematical formula}ℓ=2), and we seek a winner set of size {a mathematical formula}K+ℓ−2. Agents utilities are set as follows: For each agent e and each item {a mathematical formula}dj, {a mathematical formula}1≤j≤ℓ−2, the utility of e for {a mathematical formula}dj is 1. If e is an edge in G than connects vertices u and v then agent e's utility for u and v is 1 and is 0 for the remaining items from V.It is easy too see that the items {a mathematical formula}d1,…,dℓ−2 all belong to every optimal solution for {a mathematical formula}I′. It is also easy to see that in each optimal solution the utility of each agent e is nonzero (and exactly equal to {a mathematical formula}αℓ, the ℓ-th entry of the OWA α used) if and only if both items corresponding to the vertices connected by e are included in the solution. Thus the total utility of every optimal solution for {a mathematical formula}I′ is equal to {a mathematical formula}αℓ times the number of edges that connect any two vertices corresponding to the items from the solution.Let {a mathematical formula}A be a polynomial-time {a mathematical formula}x(n)-approximation algorithm for α-OWA-Winner. If {a mathematical formula}A, returns a solution S for {a mathematical formula}I′ with none-zero utility, then the items {a mathematical formula}d1,…,dℓ−2 all belong to S. Let us take the vertices corresponding to the items {a mathematical formula}S∖{d1,…,dℓ−2}. The number of the edges connecting these vertices is equal to the total utility of S divided by {a mathematical formula}αℓ. Thus, from {a mathematical formula}x(n)-approximation solution for {a mathematical formula}I′ we can extract an {a mathematical formula}x(n)-approximation solution for I. This completes the proof. □</paragraph><paragraph>It seems that the Densest-k-Subgraph is not easy to approximate. Khot [36] ruled out the existence of a PTAS for the problem under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions, Bhaskara et al. [9] showed polynomial integrality gap, Raghavendra and Steurer [52] and Alon et al. [2] proved that there is no polynomial-time constant approximation under non-standard assumptions.

[8], has approximation ratio {a mathematical formula}O(n1/4+ϵ), where n is the number of vertices in the input graph.</paragraph><paragraph>As a further evidence that OWAs that are not nonincreasing are particularly hard to deal with from the point of view of approximation algorithms, we show that for an extreme example of an OWA family, i.e., for the K-med OWAs, there is a very strong hardness-of-approximation result. We start from the following graph problem.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 16">In the Maximum Edge Biclique Problem (MEBP) we are given a balanced bipartite graph {a mathematical formula}(U∪V,E) where {a mathematical formula}U∪V is the set of vertices ({a mathematical formula}‖U‖=‖V‖) and E is the set of edges (there are edges only between the vertices from U and V).

By Lemma 18, this will prove our theorem.Let I be an instance of MEBP-V with bipartite graph {a mathematical formula}G=(U∪V,E) and positive integer K. From I we construct an instance {a mathematical formula}I′ of K-med-OWA-Winner in the following way. We let the set of agents N be U, the set of items A be V, and we seek a winner set of size K. The utility of agent u from item v is equal to 1 if and only if u and v are connected in G; otherwise it is 0. Now we note that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the solutions for I and for {a mathematical formula}I′. Let S be a solution for I with x edges: {a mathematical formula}S∩V is also a solution for {a mathematical formula}I′ with the utility at least equal to {a mathematical formula}x/K. Let S be a solution for {a mathematical formula}I′ with the utility x. All the agents from U with non-zero utilities, together with S, form a biclique with Kx edges.

Yet, from a different perspective, one could interpret Corollary 22 as suggesting that such an important reason is unlikely to exist (for large values of λ).</paragraph><paragraph>Nonetheless, the idea of using a simpler OWA instead of a more complex one can lead to quite intriguing results.

Even though these two OWA families seem very similar, the fact that one is nonincreasing and the other one is not makes a huge difference in terms of approximability of OWA-Winner.</paragraph></section><section label="7"><section-title>Approximation: non-finicky utilities</section-title><paragraph>One of the greatest sources of hardness of the OWA-Winner problem, that we rely on in our proofs, is that the agents may have very high utilities for some very small subsets of items, and very low utilities for the remaining ones (consider, e.g., approval-based utilities where each agent approves of relatively few items). In such cases, intuitively, either we find a perfect solution or some of the agents have to be very badly off. On the other hand, for Borda-based utilities when some agent does not get his or her top items, it is still possible to provide the agent with not-much-worse ones; the utilities decrease linearly. Indeed, Skowron et al. [55] used this observation to give a PTAS for the Chamberlin–Courant rule. Here we give a strong generalization of their result that applies to non-finicky utilities and OWA families that include, for each fixed k, k-median, k-best, and geometric progression OWAs.</paragraph><paragraph>We focus on the case of OWA vectors where only some constant number ℓ of top positions are nonzero, and on {a mathematical formula}(β,γ)-non-finicky utilities ({a mathematical formula}β,γ∈[0,1]). In this case, Algorithm 2 (a generalization of an algorithm of Skowron et al. [55]) achieves a good approximation ratio. The idea behind the algorithm is as follows: To pick K items, it proceeds in K iterations and in each iteration it introduces one new item into the winner set. For each agent it considers the top {a mathematical formula}x=γm items with the highest utilities and in a given iteration it picks an item a that maximizes the number of agents that (1) rank a among items with the highest x utilities, and (2) still have “free slots” (an agent has a free slot if among the so-far-selected winners, fewer than ℓ have utilities among the x highest ones for this agent). Before we prove that our algorithm works well, let us consider the following example.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 6">Let the items and agents be the same as in Example 3 (just as in Example 4 for Algorithm 1). Let {a mathematical formula}K=3 and let the OWA vector be {a mathematical formula}α=(2,1,0). We have {a mathematical formula}ℓ=2 nonzero entries in α. We treat the agents utilities as {a mathematical formula}(0.8,0.5)-non-finicky ones. Before we execute the algorithm, it is convenient to compute the rank function{sup:4}:{a mathematical formula} Now we can start to execute the algorithm. We have {a mathematical formula}x=γm=3 and initially each agent has two free slots. In the first iteration, the algorithm can pick either {a mathematical formula}a1, {a mathematical formula}a3, or {a mathematical formula}a5, because for each of them there are two agents for whom their rank is below 3, while for each other item there is only one agent that ranks it below 3. Let us assume that the algorithm picks {a mathematical formula}a1 (see the table below for information regarding the slots of the agents after each iteration). In the second iteration all the agents still have free slots so the algorithm can pick either {a mathematical formula}a3 or {a mathematical formula}a5. Let us assume it picks {a mathematical formula}a3. In effect, Agents 1 and 3 no longer have free slots and in the final iteration the algorithm picks one of the items to which Agent 2 assigns rank lower than 3, i.e., one of {a mathematical formula}a4, {a mathematical formula}a5, and {a mathematical formula}a6. Let us assume it picks {a mathematical formula}a4. Below we show the contents of agents' slots after executing each iteration.{a mathematical formula} The algorithm outputs set {a mathematical formula}S={a1,a3,a4}. It is interesting that this is a different set than the one returned by Algorithm 1 (see Example 4), which returned set {a mathematical formula}W={a1,a4,a5}. This latter set is slightly better than the one output by Algorithm 2; it achieves aggregated utility 84 as opposed to 83.</paragraph><paragraph label="Theorem 25">Fix a positive integer ℓ and let α be a nonincreasing OWA where at most first ℓ entries are nonzero. If the agents have{a mathematical formula}(β,γ)-non-finicky utilities, with{a mathematical formula}γm≥ℓ, thenAlgorithm 2is a polynomial-time{a mathematical formula}β(1−exp⁡(−γKℓ))-approximation algorithm for α-OWA-Winner.</paragraph><paragraph label="Proof">Consider an instance I of α-OWA-Winner, with n agents, m items, and where we seek a winner set of size K. Let {a mathematical formula}x=γm. We use an OWA where an agent's total utility from a winner set W depends on this agent's utilities for his or her top ℓ items from W. We introduce the notion of each agent's free slots as follows. Initially, each agent has ℓ free slots. Whenever an agent j has a free slot and the algorithm selects an item a such that for agent j item a is among x items with highest utilities, we say that a starts occupying one free slot of j. After such an item is selected, j has one free slot less.Let {a mathematical formula}ni denote the total number of free slots of all the agents after the i-th iteration of the algorithm. Naturally, we have {a mathematical formula}n0=ℓn. We show by induction that {a mathematical formula}ni≤ℓn(1−xℓm)i. Indeed, the inequality is true for {a mathematical formula}i=0. Let us assume that it is true for some i: {a mathematical formula}ni≤ℓn(1−xℓm)i. Let {a mathematical formula}Fi denote the set of agents that have free slots after iteration i. There are at least {a mathematical formula}niℓ such agents. For {a mathematical formula}j∈Fi, let {a mathematical formula}S(j) be the number of j's top-x items that were not included in the solution yet. If {a mathematical formula}j∈Fi has s free slots, then {a mathematical formula}S(j)=(x−ℓ+s). Thus we have that {a mathematical formula}∑j∈FiS(j)≥ni+(x−ℓ)niℓ=nixℓ. By the pigeonhole principle, there exists an item that is among top-x items for at least {a mathematical formula}nixℓm agents from {a mathematical formula}Fi. Thus, after the {a mathematical formula}(i+1)-th iteration of the algorithm, the total number of free slots is at most:{a mathematical formula} The number of free slots after the last iteration is at most:{a mathematical formula} Thus the number of occupied slots is at least {a mathematical formula}ℓn−ℓnexp⁡(−γKℓ). Every item that occupies an agent's slot has utility for this agent at least {a mathematical formula}βumax, where {a mathematical formula}umax is the maximal utility that any of the agents assigns to an item.It remains to assess the OWA coefficients for the utilities of the items in the solution. If for some agent i the utility of an item a, {a mathematical formula}ui,a, is taken with coefficient {a mathematical formula}αp ({a mathematical formula}p&gt;1), then in the solution there must be an item {a mathematical formula}a′ such that {a mathematical formula}ui,a′≥ui,a and {a mathematical formula}ui,a′ is taken with coefficient {a mathematical formula}αp−1. So there must exist at least {a mathematical formula}1ℓ(ℓn−ℓnexp⁡(−γKℓ)) occurrences of the items whose utilities are taken with coefficient {a mathematical formula}α1. By repeating this reasoning for the remaining occurrences of the items from the solution, since α is nonincreasing, we get that the total utility of the agents is at least {a mathematical formula}βumax(ℓn−ℓnexp⁡(−γKℓ))1ℓ∑i=1ℓαi=βumaxn(1−exp⁡(−γKℓ))∑i=1ℓαi.

In the i-th iteration, {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤ℓ, the algorithm operates as follows: Using the algorithm from Lemma 28, for {a mathematical formula}p=ℓ, we find a set {a mathematical formula}A(i) of up to {a mathematical formula}K/ℓ items such that at least {a mathematical formula}n(i−1)(1−exp⁡(−γKℓ2)) of the agents from the set {a mathematical formula}N(i−1) each rank at least one of these items among positions {a mathematical formula}(i−1)x+1,…,ix of their preference orders. (Strictly speaking, in this setting agents do not have preference orders but utility values. For each agent, we form his or her preference order by sorting the items in the decreasing order of the utilities, breaking the ties arbitrarily.) We let {a mathematical formula}N(i) be the set of these agents and we set {a mathematical formula}n(i)=‖N(i)‖. Finally, we set {a mathematical formula}W=⋃i=1ℓA(i) and return W as the set of winners (it is easy to see that W contains at most K items; if K contains fewer than K items then we supplement it with {a mathematical formula}K−‖W‖ arbitrarily chosen ones).By the construction of our algorithm, each of the agents from the set {a mathematical formula}N(ℓ) ranks at least ℓ items from the set W on positions no worse than {a mathematical formula}ℓx=γm. Thus each such an agent assigns to each such an item utility at least equal to {a mathematical formula}βumax. Consequently, the total utility that the agents from the set N derive from the solution W is at least:{a mathematical formula} This is so, because for each i, {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤ℓ, each of the agents in the set {a mathematical formula}N(ℓ) derives utility {a mathematical formula}αiβumax from the item that she ranks as i'th best among the items from W.By construction of our algorithm, we have:{a mathematical formula} Thus, the total utility obtained by the agents is at least:{a mathematical formula} Now, since the maximum possible total utility of all the agents is upper-bounded by {a mathematical formula}n(∑i=1ℓαi)umax, we have that our algorithm has approximation ratio {a mathematical formula}β(1−ℓexp⁡(−γKℓ2)). It is clear that it runs in polynomial time, and so the proof is complete. □</paragraph><paragraph>Based on this result, we can obtain a PTAS for the analogous setting.</paragraph><paragraph label="Theorem 30">Fix a value ℓ and let α be a family of OWAs that have nonzero values on top ℓ positions only.

Yet, recently Faliszewski et al. [26, Theorem 13] have shown some natural settings with approval-based utilities where they apply.</paragraph><paragraph>To summarize, in this section we have shown that in spite of the intrinsic hardness of the OWA-Winner problem, there are very natural classes of utilities and OWA vectors for which the problem can be solved quite accurately and very efficiently.</paragraph></section><section label="8"><section-title>Related work</section-title><paragraph>In this section we give a more detailed overview of various research lines that are related to our work.</paragraph><paragraph>Weighing intrinsic values by coefficients that are a function of their rank in a list is of course not new. Ordered Weighted Average operators have been used extensively in multicriteria decision making and, to a lesser extent, in social choice [34]; the vector of values then corresponds to criteria (in MCDM) or to agents (in social choice). Also, rank-dependent expected utility (RDEU) [51] is a well-known research stream in decision theory, whose starting point is the construction of models that explain Allais' paradox: given a set of possible consequences of an act, the contribution of a possible consequence on the agent's RDEU is a function of its probability and of its rank in the list of consequences ordered by decreasing probability. While these three research streams use ranks to modify the contribution of a criterion, an agent, or a possible consequence, in our setting they modify the contribution of items, our final aim being to select an optimal set of items. Since we do not select criteria, agents or possible consequences, it is not obvious how our results can apply to these three aforementioned research fields.</paragraph><paragraph>There are three recent pieces of research that use OWA operators in the context of voting and that call for detailed discussion. We describe them in the chronological order.</paragraph><paragraph>Goldsmith et al. [31] define rank-dependent scoring rules. Under standard positional scoring rules, the score of a candidate is the sum of the scores it obtains from all the voters, where the score that a candidate obtains from a given voter depends only on his or her rank in this voter's preference order. Rank-dependent scoring rules generalize this idea as follows. Instead of simply summing up the scores of a given candidate, they apply an OWA operator to the list of the scores that he or she got from the voters. Thus a rank-dependent scoring rule is defined by a scoring vector (a function mapping ranks to scores) and an OWA operator. Here, OWAs replace the sum operator for aggregating the scores coming from different agents, while in our setting they aggregate the scores of different objects for a fixed agent.</paragraph><paragraph>Amanatidis et al. [3] define a family of committee election rules (which can also be used for multiple referenda) based on the following principle. Each voter specifies his or her preferred committee and each voter's disutility for a committee is given by the Hamming distance between the committee and the voter's preferred one. Then the disutilities of the voters are aggregated using an OWA operator. The committee with the lowest aggregated disutility wins. (In the particular case of the sum operator, the obtained rule is the Bloc committee election rule, while in the case of the minimum, the obtained rule is the Minimax Approval Voting rule; see the work of Brams et al. [12] for the definition and other works for computational discussions [39], [15], [45].) They obtain a number of hardness and approximability results, which cannot be compared to ours because in their work, again, OWAs are used for aggregating scores coming from different agents.</paragraph><paragraph>Finally, the work of Elkind and Ismaïli [23] is probably the closest one to ours. They study multiwinner elections and they use OWAs to define generalizations of the Chamberlin–Courant rule but, once again, they use OWAs to aggregate the utilities for a committee coming from different agents. The standard utilitarian Chamberlin–Courant rule sums up the scores that a committee gets from different voters, whereas the egalitarian variant considers the minimum score a committee receives. They generalize this idea by using an OWA operator, in effect obtaining a spectrum of rules between the utilitarian and the egalitarian variants. They obtain a number of complexity results, both in the general case and in specific cases corresponding to domain restrictions. For the same reason as in the preceding paragraphs, their results are incomparable to ours.</paragraph><paragraph>In the three pieces of research discussed above, OWA operators aggregate scores or utilities given to candidates or committees by different agents, which is very different from our use of OWAs. Nonetheless, there exists a high-level common point between the four approaches. In all cases the rules corresponding to the sum of scores, and to either the minimum or the maximum of scores, were already known and seen as interesting, but somewhat extreme. In all cases, OWAs give rise to an interpolation between these extremities, leading to rules and approaches that are likely to be interesting in practice.</paragraph><paragraph>Let us now move on to other related works and other related streams of research. Several known settings are recovered as particular cases of our general model. In particular, this applies to the case of the Chamberlin–Courant proportional representation rule [18], to the case of Proportional Approval Voting [37], and to (variants of) the budgeted social choice model [41], [49], [42]. Computational complexity of the Chamberlin–Courant rule was first studied by Procaccia et al. [50], its parameterized complexity was analyzed by Betzler et al. [7], and the complexity under restricted domains was studied by Betzler et al. [7], Skowron et al. [56], Yu et al. [59], and Clearwater et al. [20]. The first approximation algorithm was proposed by Lu and Boutilier [41]. The results on approximability were then extended in several directions by Skowron et al. [55], [54]. Proportional Approval Voting was studied computationally and axiomatically by Aziz et al. [5], [4] and by Elkind and Lackner [24].</paragraph><paragraph>Group recommender systems (see, e.g., the work of O'Connor et al. [47] for one of the first approaches, and the surveys of Jameson and Smyth [33] and of Masthoff [43]) aim at recommending sets or sequences of items (such as a set of television programs or a sequence of songs) to a group of users, based on preferences of all group members. Two mainstream approaches have been developed (see the survey of Jameson and Smyth [33]): those based on the construction of an ‘average user’ whose preferences are built by aggregating the preferences of the individuals in the group, and those based on producing individual recommendations and aggregating them. Unlike these, our approach (which recommends sets, but not yet sequences) proceeds in a single step, and enables a fine-tuning of the contribution of an item to each user's utility depending on the number of better items (for that user) in the list.</paragraph><paragraph>The facility location problem (fl) is closely related to {a mathematical formula}1-best-OWA-Winner. In fl, however, the goal is to minimize the dissatisfaction of the agents instead of maximizing their utility (satisfaction). Although, as far as exact solutions are concerned both formulations are equivalent, there is a significant difference in the quality of approximation (the difference between approximation guarantees for the maximization and minimization formulations of {a mathematical formula}1-best-OWA-Winner for Borda utilities is described by Skowron et al. [55]). Some works focus on general dissatisfaction functions [29], but most of the results were established for dissatisfactions corresponding to the distances, and thus satisfying the triangle inequality [32], [53]. Also, in fl the goal is to minimize the dissatisfaction of the worst-off agent (the egalitarian view). The utilitarian version of the problem is called k-median[32]. The parameterized complexity of the problem was analyzed by Fellows and Fernau [29]. The approximation algorithms include those of Chukad and Williamson [19], those of Jain and Vazirani [32], and those of Shmoys et al. [53]. Interestingly, a local-search algorithm (which, to the best of our knowledge, is the best known approximation algorithm for the capacitated version of fl[19]) is also a {a mathematical formula}12-approximation algorithm for maximizing nondecreasing submodular functions [46], and thus for OWA-Winner with non-decreasing utility functions. The problem of facility location for the case where the facilities are vulnerable to failures has been considered by Swamy and Shmoys [57], who studied a setting which closely resembles applying the {a mathematical formula}ℓ-best OWA operators in the original facility location and k-median problems. We conclude that it would be interesting to compare the algorithms for fl and k-median with different algorithms for OWA-Winner on real preference data (e.g., on the data from PrefLib, collected by Mattei and Walsh [44]).</paragraph></section><section label="9"><section-title>Summary</section-title><paragraph>Our contribution is threefold. First, we have proposed a new model for the selection of a collective sets of items. This model appears to be very general, encompasses several known frameworks, and can be applied to various domains such as committee elections, group recommendation, and beyond. Second, we have investigated the computational feasibility of the model, depending on the various assumptions that we can make about the agents' utilities and the choice of the OWA vector. Table 1 in Section 4 gives a summary of our results. We note that many of these results directly related to the OWA families that appear in the settings from Section 3 that were our motivating force. Third, we have defined non-finicky utilities that model settings where agents are relatively “easy to please.” We believe that non-finicky utilities may find applications far beyond our framework.</paragraph><paragraph>Some of our results look negative, while some others (especially in the case of non-finicky utilities) are on the positive side. However, the way the results should be interpreted depends on the application domain. In political elections and other high-stake domains, it is appealing to view an approximation algorithm as a new, full-fledged voting rule, which may enjoy many desirable properties (on this point see the works of Caragiannis et al. [16], [17], Skowron et al. [55], and Elkind et al. [22]). In particular, we have shown that the election system Sequential Proportional Approval Voting, SPAV, (which has been known long before the computational complexity theory was developed) is actually a greedy approximation algorithm for the Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) election rule, which is an interesting result per se. (The reader may also wish to consult the paper of Aziz et al. [5] regarding the complexity of approval-based multiwinner rules.) Yet, it is arguably not reasonable to use an approximation algorithm (even with a good performance guarantee) if it is viewed as nothing more than an approximation algorithm of another rule, and it is even less reasonable to use a heuristic search algorithm (when there is no good approximation algorithm); this implies that using this model for political elections is feasible when the number of candidates is small enough, but can become problematic beyond that (unless we define the approximation algorithm to be the new voting rule, as said above). On the other hand, in low-stake application domains (which can include some committee elections, and of course group recommender systems), it may become perfectly reasonable, and in that case even NP-hardness and inapproximability results should not discourage us from using the model. For these domains, our negative results only tell us that we may have to resort to heuristic search algorithms. Developing such algorithm is one of the interesting directions for further research.</paragraph><paragraph>Our work leads to many other open problems. In particular, one might want to strengthen our approximation algorithms, provide algorithms for more general cases, provide more inapproximability results. Among these problems, a particularly interesting one regards the approximability of OWA-Winner for the arithmetic progression family of OWAs. For this case, our set of results is very limited. In particular, can one provide a PTAS for arithmetic-progression OWAs under non-finicky (in particular Borda-based) utilities? Can one do so for {a mathematical formula}K2-best OWAs/{a mathematical formula}K2-median OWAs? Can one do so for the harmonic OWA, used in Proportional Approval Voting?</paragraph><section-title>Acknowledgements</section-title></section></content><acknowledgements><paragraph>The authors were supported by NCN grant 2013/09/N/ST6/03661 and by AGH University grant 11.11.230.124 (statutory research).

We give a reduction from VertexCover (see the previous proof for an exact definition). Let I be an instance of the VertexCover problem that consists of undirected graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E), where {a mathematical formula}V={v1,…,vm} and {a mathematical formula}E={e1,…,en}, and positive integer K (without loss of generality, we assume that {a mathematical formula}K≥3).From I, we construct an instance {a mathematical formula}I′ of {a mathematical formula}(K−1)-best-OWA-Winner with Borda-based utilities as follows. We set{a mathematical formula} and we let the set of items be {a mathematical formula}A=V∪{d1,d2}∪H, where {a mathematical formula}H={h1,…,hx} and {a mathematical formula}{d1,d2} are sets of dummy items that we need to build appropriate structure of the utility profile. To build the set of agents N, we set{a mathematical formula} and we set {a mathematical formula}N=NE∪N1∪…∪Ny, where {a mathematical formula}NE={e11,e12,…,en1,en2} contains pairs of agents that correspond to the edges of G, and {a mathematical formula}N1,…,Ny contain pairs of agents needed for the construction. Specifically, every set {a mathematical formula}Ni, {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤y, consists of two agents, {a mathematical formula}fi1 and {a mathematical formula}fi2. We refer to the agents in the set {a mathematical formula}N1∪⋯∪Ny as the “dummy agents.”We describe agents' utilities through their preference orders. The agents in the set {a mathematical formula}NE have the following preference orders. Let {a mathematical formula}ei∈E be an edge of the graph that connects vertices {a mathematical formula}vi,1 and {a mathematical formula}vi,2. Agents {a mathematical formula}ei1 and {a mathematical formula}ei2 have preference orders:{a mathematical formula} (When we put a set of items in a preference order, this means that this set can be replaced by these items in an arbitrary, easily computable, way.) Each agent {a mathematical formula}fi1, {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤y, has the same, fixed, preference order:{a mathematical formula} Similarly, each agent {a mathematical formula}fi2, {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤y, has preference order:{a mathematical formula}Finally, in the instance {a mathematical formula}I′ we seek a set of winners of size {a mathematical formula}K+2. This means that we use {a mathematical formula}(K+1)-best-OWA to compute the aggregated utility than an agent derives from a set of winners.This concludes the description of the reduction and it is clear that it is polynomial-time computable. Before we prove that it is correct, let us make several observations. Let W be some optimal solution for {a mathematical formula}I′. We claim that W does not contain any of the items from H. For the sake of contradiction, assume that some {a mathematical formula}h∈H belongs to W. Since {a mathematical formula}d1 and {a mathematical formula}d2 are ranked ahead of h in every preference order (and in some preference orders {a mathematical formula}d1 is first and {a mathematical formula}d2 is second, so their utility cannot be ignored by the {a mathematical formula}(K+1)-best-OWA), we infer that {a mathematical formula}d1 and {a mathematical formula}d2 must belong to W as well (otherwise we would obtain higher utility by replacing h with one of {a mathematical formula}d1 and {a mathematical formula}d2 in W). Let v be some item from V that does not belong to W. If we replace h with v in W then the total utility of the dummy agents increases by at least 2y. Why is this so? Consider some pair {a mathematical formula}Ni, {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤y of dummy agents. Item h is either the lowest ranked member of W for both {a mathematical formula}fi1 and {a mathematical formula}fi2 or for neither. We consider these cases:<list>h is the lowest-ranked winner for both the agents in{a mathematical formula}Ni. Replacing h with v means that either some other member {a mathematical formula}h′ of {a mathematical formula}H∩W becomes the lowest ranked winner for both {a mathematical formula}fi1 and {a mathematical formula}fi2, or {a mathematical formula}d2 becomes the lowest ranked winner for {a mathematical formula}fi1 and {a mathematical formula}d1 becomes the lowest ranked winner for {a mathematical formula}fi2. In either case, both {a mathematical formula}fi1 and {a mathematical formula}fi2 obtain utility higher by at least one from v than from the item that became the new lowest-ranked winner. Thus, the total utility yielded by these two agents increases by at least two.h is not the lowest-ranked winner for either agent in{a mathematical formula}Ni. In this case, since both agents rank v higher thank h and replacing h with v does not change the lowest-ranked winner for either of the agents, their total utility also increases at least by two.Next, we claim that both </list><paragraph>{a mathematical formula}d1 and {a mathematical formula}d2 belong to W. We give a detailed argument for {a mathematical formula}d1 only; the case of {a mathematical formula}d2 is analogous. For the sake of contradiction, assume that {a mathematical formula}d1 does not belong to W. Let {a mathematical formula}vk be an item from W such for each {a mathematical formula}vj, {a mathematical formula}j&lt;k, {a mathematical formula}vj does not belong to W. By our assumptions, for each agent {a mathematical formula}fi2, {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤y, {a mathematical formula}vk is the lowest-ranked winner from W. Thus, if we replace {a mathematical formula}vk with {a mathematical formula}d1 in W, then the utility of each agent {a mathematical formula}fi2 will not change, whereas the utility of each agent {a mathematical formula}fi1 will increase. Further, the utility of each agent from {a mathematical formula}NE will increase. Thus, by replacing {a mathematical formula}vk with {a mathematical formula}d1, we can increase the total utility of the agents. We reach a contradiction and we conclude that {a mathematical formula}d1 must have been a member of W. An analogous argument shows that {a mathematical formula}d2 belongs to W as well.As the result of the above reasoning, we infer that each set of winners consists of {a mathematical formula}d1, {a mathematical formula}d2, and K items from V. Whenever both {a mathematical formula}d1 and {a mathematical formula}d2 are included in the set of winners and neither item from H is, the total utility of the dummy agents is the same, irrespective which items from V are selected. With these observations, we now show that the answer for the input VertexCover instance is “yes” if and only if there is a size-{a mathematical formula}(K+2) winner set for {a mathematical formula}I′ that for agents in the set {a mathematical formula}NE yields total utility at least {a mathematical formula}nx(K+4).{a mathematical formula}(⇒) Let us assume that there exists a cover C for I, that is, a set C of K vertices such that each edge is incident to at least one vertex from C. We show that winner set {a mathematical formula}W=C∪{d1,d2} gives total utility of every two agents {a mathematical formula}ei1 and {a mathematical formula}ei2, {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤n, equal to at least {a mathematical formula}x(K+4). Pick some arbitrary i, {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤n, and let {a mathematical formula}vi,1 and {a mathematical formula}vi,2 be the two vertices connected by edge {a mathematical formula}ei. If both {a mathematical formula}vi,1 and {a mathematical formula}vi,2 belong to C, then {a mathematical formula}ei2 obtains utility at least x for each item in {a mathematical formula}{vi,1,vi,2,d1,d2} (at least utility 4x in total). On the other hand, {a mathematical formula}ei1 obtains utility at least x for each item in {a mathematical formula}W−{vi,1,vi,2}. This gives utility at least Kx. Altogether, both agents get utility at least {a mathematical formula}x(K+4). If only one of the items {a mathematical formula}vi,1 and {a mathematical formula}vi,2, say {a mathematical formula}vi,1, belongs to C, then {a mathematical formula}ei2 obtains utility at least 3x (at least x for every item from {a mathematical formula}{vi,1,d1,d2}), and {a mathematical formula}ei1 obtains utility at least {a mathematical formula}(K+1)x (at least 2x from items {a mathematical formula}d1 and {a mathematical formula}d2, and at least {a mathematical formula}(K−1)x from the {a mathematical formula}K−1 members of C that {a mathematical formula}ei1 ranks on the top positions). Again, both agents get utility at least {a mathematical formula}x(K+4). Thus the total utility of the agents in {a mathematical formula}NE in the optimal solution must be at least {a mathematical formula}nx(K+4).{a mathematical formula}(⇐) Assume that W is some optimal solution for {a mathematical formula}I′ and that for the agents in {a mathematical formula}NE it yields utility at least {a mathematical formula}nx(K+4). By previous discussion, we know that W contains {a mathematical formula}d1, {a mathematical formula}d2, and K members of V. We set {a mathematical formula}C=W∖{d1,d2}. Let us fix some arbitrary i, {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤n. Let {a mathematical formula}vi,1 and {a mathematical formula}vi,2 be the two vertices connected by edge {a mathematical formula}ei. We observe that under W, the total utility of agents {a mathematical formula}ei1 and {a mathematical formula}ei2 is at most {a mathematical formula}(x+m+2)(K+4)+mK. To see this, let z be the number of items from {a mathematical formula}{vi,1,vi,2} that are included in C and note that (1) for the upper bound we can disregard the OWA that we use, (2) there are {a mathematical formula}x+m+2 items and so we can upper-bound the utility derived from each item by {a mathematical formula}x+m+2, (3) altogether, the items from W are ranked on at most {a mathematical formula}K+2−z top-{a mathematical formula}(m+2) positions by {a mathematical formula}ei1 (we upper-bound their total utility by {a mathematical formula}(K+2−z)(x+m+2)) and at most {a mathematical formula}2+z top-{a mathematical formula}(m+2) positions by {a mathematical formula}ei2 (we upper-bound their total utility by {a mathematical formula}(2+z)(x+m+2)), and (4) the items from W are ranked on at most z bottom-m positions by {a mathematical formula}ei1 (we upper-bound their total utility by zm) and on {a mathematical formula}K−z bottom-m positions by {a mathematical formula}ei2 (we upper-bound their total utility by {a mathematical formula}(K−z)m). When we sum up these upper bounds, we get {a mathematical formula}(x+m+2)(K+4)+mK. However, for our argument we also need an upper bound on the total utility of {a mathematical formula}ei1 and {a mathematical formula}ei2 under the assumption that neither {a mathematical formula}vi,1 nor {a mathematical formula}vi,2 belongs to C. In this case, the upper bound is {a mathematical formula}(x+m+2)(K+3)+mK. We obtain it in the same way as the previous bound, except that we note that due to our {a mathematical formula}(K+1)-best-OWA, the utility derived by {a mathematical formula}ei1 can take into account at most {a mathematical formula}K+1 agents from the top-{a mathematical formula}(m+2) positions of the preference order of {a mathematical formula}ei1.Based on these upper bounds, we will now show that if the total utility derived from W by the agents in {a mathematical formula}NE is {a mathematical formula}nx(K+4), then C must correspond to a cover of all the edges of G. To this end, consider a situation where there is at least one edge {a mathematical formula}ei such that neither of the vertices that it connects belongs to C. By using our upper bounds, in this case the total utility of the agents from {a mathematical formula}NE can be at most:{a mathematical formula} (The last two lines follow directly by the definition of x.) So, from the assumption that C is not a solution for I, we obtain that the total utility of the agents in {a mathematical formula}NE must be lower than {a mathematical formula}nx(K+4), which contradicts our assumption. Thus C is a correct solution for I and, so, I is a yes-instance of VertexCover.
