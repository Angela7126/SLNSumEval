First, at the level of representation of the information, we pass from belief bases to complex epistemic states. Second, the profiles are represented as functions of finite societies to the set of epistemic states (a sort of vectors) and not as multisets of epistemic states. Third, we extend the set of rational postulates in order to consider the epistemic versions of the classical postulates of social choice theory: standard domain, Pareto property, independence of irrelevant alternatives and absence of dictator. These epistemic versions of social postulates are given, essentially, in terms of the finite propositional logic. We state some representation theorems for these operators. These extensions and representation theorems allow us to establish an epistemic and very general version of Arrow's impossibility theorem. One of the interesting features of our result, is that it holds for different representations of epistemic states; for instance conditionals, ordinal conditional functions and, of course, total preorders.</abstract><keywords>Belief merging;Epistemic states;Arrow's impossibility theorem</keywords><content><section label="1"><section-title>Introduction</section-title><paragraph>Belief merging studies the methods leading to extract a coherent piece of information from many sources, which may be mutually contradictory. The applications in this domain go from decision making, passing by medical diagnosis, policy planning, to automatic integration of data. Understanding the theoretical model, its properties and limits is important in order to know in which domains these methods are valid and to develop future applications.</paragraph><paragraph>Several frameworks have been proposed in order to study this kind of processes. We take mainly as starting point the logical framework for merging information introduced and extensively studied by Konieczny and Pino Pérez [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] (the KPP framework) and the shift to considering more complex representations of information, in particular epistemic states which has been introduced by Mata and Pino Pérez [21] (the framework of epistemic states fusion, ESF for short).</paragraph><paragraph>In the KPP framework, following the early works of Katsuno and Mendelzon in belief revision [13], all the pieces of information have the same nature. Actually, the pieces of information to be merged are represented by formulas codifying the belief bases of each agent{sup:1} (a belief base is a consistent finite set of propositional formulas). Then, in the KPP framework, a fusion process (called a merging operator) aims to merge in a coherent way the belief bases of the agents under an integrity constraint codified also by a propositional formula which has to be satisfied by the result of the process. Moreover, the result of this fusion process has to be close to the belief bases of each agent. A brief and more detailed account of this framework is given in Section 2.3.</paragraph><paragraph>The following example illustrates a simple case of a merging process:</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 1">Alice, Bob and Peter are good friends. They decide to meet and do something together next Saturday night. The options are going to a restaurant or go to the cinema. Alice has not much time and prefers to go to only one place: to a restaurant or to the cinema but not both places. Bob wants to have much fun with his friends on Saturday night, and therefore he would like to go to a restaurant and also to the cinema. Peter would like to go to a restaurant but he doesn't like the current movies, so he doesn't want to go to the cinema. A reasonable fusion process will say that the best alternative is going to a restaurant and not going to the cinema.{sup:2}</paragraph><paragraph>In the ESF framework, all the pieces of information are (complex) epistemic states. In particular, the information playing the role of integrity constraints is represented as an epistemic state too. As a matter of fact, an epistemic state contains the beliefs (a logical part) and eventually additional information necessary for an adequate treatment of the evolution of the information in a precise and structured way. The necessity of considering more complex representations of epistemic states has been stated in the work of Darwiche and Pearl [8], in particular they are necessary in order to have a good behavior with respect to the iteration of the process. We adopt here, essentially, the definition of epistemic states proposed by Benferhat et al. [5]. We establish a result (Theorem 6) which shows the necessity in our framework for considering epistemic states instead of simple beliefs bases. However, we have to say that this framework becomes necessary at the level of profiles and not at the level of integrity constraints. The fact of considering complex epistemic states at the level of integrity constraints makes the framework richer, allows the possibility of modeling more complex situations (cf. Example 2 below) as well as having postulates where this richness is exploited (see for instance [21] where we can find a characterization of iterable epistemic states fusion operators).</paragraph><paragraph>The abstract definition of epistemic state can be instantiated in different concrete representations. For instance, ordinal conditional functions (ranking functions) proposed by Spohn [24]; certain kinds of conditionals like rational consequence relations proposed by Lehmann and Magidor [20]; the total preorders can also be concrete representations of epistemic states; and of course the classical representations: belief bases (logical theories or simply formulas) are also representations of epistemic states. In the following example we use the total preorder representation in order to illustrate the behavior of a complex merging process.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 2">Anne and Bob have to travel from point A to point B. There are four paths to accomplish the travel: {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2, {a mathematical formula}w3 and {a mathematical formula}w4. Anne thinks that the best way to carry out the travel is {a mathematical formula}w1. Actually she thinks that {a mathematical formula}wi is better than {a mathematical formula}wi+1 for {a mathematical formula}i=1,2,3. Bob thinks that the best way to travel is through {a mathematical formula}w4 and the others possibilities are equally good. A common consensual result in this situation is to take path {a mathematical formula}w1, the path that Anne prefers and which is not so bad for Bob, whereas path {a mathematical formula}w4 is very far from Anne's preferred path. Indeed, the consensual preference is path {a mathematical formula}w1 as the first option, then path {a mathematical formula}w2. The last options are indifferently paths {a mathematical formula}w3 and {a mathematical formula}w4. Now suppose that Anne and Bob hate heavy traffic. The last news about the traffic inform that there are enormous traffic jams in the paths {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w4, whereas on paths {a mathematical formula}w2 and {a mathematical formula}w3 there is light traffic. With this new information, which can play the role of an integrity constraint, the global preference should be: path {a mathematical formula}w2 is the first option; the second option is path {a mathematical formula}w3, followed by path {a mathematical formula}w1 and finally {a mathematical formula}w4 is the last option.</paragraph><paragraph>It is worth to note that in the previous example the use of complex integrity constraints can be useful to model the problem. A formal treatment of this example will be done in Section 5.</paragraph><paragraph>The use of complex epistemic states is not completely new in belief merging. As a matter of fact, Meyer [22] gave a merging model of more complex epistemic states for belief merging. In Meyer's work the epistemic states were defined by ranking functions over interpretations. However, in this context, Meyer did not develop any study of the logical properties of these operators, and, therefore, does not give representation theorems for his operators.</paragraph><paragraph>Let us recall that in the KPP framework are proposed several postulates of rationality that good merging operators have to satisfy. The belief merging operators satisfying those postulates generalize the seminal belief revision operators presented by Alchourrón, Gardenfors and Makinson [1], [11], [13] in which the beliefs (alias epistemic states) have also the same kind of representation, that is, a set of propositional sentences. In the ESF framework are also proposed postulates of rationality [21] generalizing those postulates of the KPP framework. The operators satisfying these postulates, called ES fusion operators, generalize, indeed, the epistemic states revision operators proposed by Benferhat et al. [5]. A very important feature is that in both frameworks the operators satisfying some adequate sets of syntactical postulates can be represented in a semantical way in terms of total preorders over interpretations (representation theorems). Actually, such representation theorems show that fusion operators are determined by “group preferences” over interpretations, and the models of the most entrenched beliefs of the resulting epistemic state are the most entrenched models of the integrity constraints which are “globally preferred”.</paragraph><paragraph>The representation theorems and the construction of concrete operators [15], [16], [17], [14], [18] suggest that the merging processes are in relationship with the process of preference aggregation studied in social choice theory [2], [25]. This theory studies, in a general way, the electoral process. The central questions in social choice theory are the following ones: given a set of alternatives and set of individuals with their preferences over the alternatives, how to select the best alternatives for the group; in what measure the method for selecting the alternatives is good.</paragraph><paragraph>One of the most general models of election is based on the so called social choice functions. Indeed, these functions are quite similar to the operators considered in merging processes (see Sections 2.5). These social choice functions work as follows (see Section 2.4 for a more formal treatment): suppose that a group of individuals have to choose the best alternatives among a given set of alternatives. The preferences of each individual are given in terms of orderings over the alternatives; the set of all these individual preferences is known as a preference profile. An agenda is a subset of the alternatives set. The input of a social choice function is a couple composed by a preference profile and an agenda; the output has to be a subset of the agenda given in the input.</paragraph><paragraph>One measure of the goodness of a social choice function is the fact that it satisfies some suitable properties of rationality or some reasonable democracy criteria. Actually, Kenneth Arrow [2], proposes the following very natural principles:</paragraph><list><list-item label="(i)">For any preference of the individuals and any agenda, the social choice function has to give an output.</list-item><list-item label="(ii)">If all the individuals have the same preferences, they must determine the output of the function.</list-item><list-item label="(iii)">The output of the function only depends on the way in which the individuals express their preferences on the alternatives of the agenda.</list-item><list-item label="(iv)">The output of the function does not depend on the preferences of one sole individual.</list-item></list><paragraph>Arrow establishes that it is impossible to have a function satisfying all these criteria at the same time. This is his famous impossibility theorem.</paragraph><paragraph>Another interesting problem in social choice theory is to know when an electoral process can be manipulated[12], [23] (see [26] for a very complete study of manipulation). This means that there is a situation in which an individual (the manipulator) obtains a result which is more suitable for him when the preferences given by him are not his real preferences. When there are no situations of this kind, an electoral process is said to be strategy-proof.</paragraph><paragraph>The suggested relationships between belief merging and social choice theory have inspired some works [6], [10], [22] in which the aspects of impossibility and strategy-proofness are explored in the framework of belief merging. In some of the previous works, for instance in Chopra et al. [6], the results of impossibility do not hold and the operators are strategy-proof. In other works, like in Everaere et al. [10], the behavior of some particular classes of merging operators is studied with respect to manipulation. Therein is proved that some classes of merging operators are not strategy-proof. In that work the impossibility problems are not addressed.</paragraph><paragraph>Facing these opposed behaviors of some classes of merging operators, our goal is to better understand what is happening in terms of general rational properties expressed in the logical language of belief merging. In particular, we are interested in knowing if there is a general result of impossibility in this setting, such as the Arrow's impossibility theorem in social choice theory.</paragraph><paragraph>In order to accomplish our study, we extend in this work the KPP framework of logic-based merging presented by Konieczny and Pino Pérez [17], [19] in three ways:</paragraph><paragraph>First, the representation of information is more general; actually, we continue with the abstract view of epistemic states present in [5], [21]. Moreover, the representation of profiles will be more general; we adopt a functional view. The notion of profile, first given as a multiset of belief bases or epistemic states, is extended in the current work. Actually, the multiset representation has implicitly the anonymity of the sources of information. Thus, this is not compatible with the existence of a dictator, even not with the existence of a manipulator. In order to have a representation of the profiles which is more flexible and eventually compatible with the existence of dictators and more general than multisets, we adopt the functional view: a profile will be a function of a finite set of agents in the set of epistemic states. Our view generalizes the notion of profiles as lists or vectors explicit in [6], [10].</paragraph><paragraph>Second, we present some postulates given in terms of the finite propositional logic (the “visible” part of epistemic states) which define some classes of merging operators of abstract epistemic states, continuing with the abstract view of epistemic states present in [5], [21]. We state some key representation theorems for these operators.</paragraph><paragraph>It is worth noting that the syntax independence postulate, (IC3) (see Section 2.3), presented by Konieczny and Pino Pérez, is not present in its complete form. Actually this postulate implies a very strong form of anonymity and therefore it is incompatible with the notion of dictator. The operators considered by Chopra et al. [6] satisfy this postulate. That is the reason they don't have impossibility results. In our setting, this postulate is slightly weakened in order to render it compatible with the notion of dictator.</paragraph><paragraph>The fairness postulate, (IC4) (see Section 2.3), considered in the KPP framework says that if two agents satisfy the integrity constraints and the result of merging is consistent with the beliefs of one of the agents, then the result has to be consistent with the beliefs of the other agent. This postulate is not present in our framework. The main reason for putting aside this postulate is its specificity. The only known merging operators satisfying this postulate are the operators defined by distances (see [17], [19]). Actually, in [17], it is proved that some very natural operators satisfy (IC4) iff they are defined using a distance. There is, also, another important reason for withdrawing (IC4): many important classes of well behaved operators that we believe are worth being considered, do not satisfy (IC4). We can use Example 2 in order to illustrate this situation. In that example one may consider that there are no integrity constraints. Thus, the beliefs of the agents satisfy trivially the integrity constraints. A common consensual result in this situation is to take path {a mathematical formula}w1, the path that Anne prefers and which is not so bad for Bob, whereas path {a mathematical formula}w4 is very far from Anne's preferred path. Thus, the result is consistent with the beliefs of Anne but it is not consistent with the beliefs of Bob. Therefore (IC4) is not satisfied.</paragraph><paragraph>Other axioms concerning egalitarianism coming from social choice theory, have been considered in belief merging. In particular the Sen-Hammond condition has been studied in the framework of belief merging [9]. Therein, an interesting study of egalitarian behavior of belief merging operators is done.</paragraph><paragraph>Third, we enrich the set of rational postulates by introducing social postulates inspired on the classical Arrow's postulates in social choice theory [3]. All these postulates are formulated in a logical setting. In particular, we give the logical versions of classical postulates involved in the Arrow's impossibility theorem: standard domain, Pareto property, independence of irrelevant alternatives and absence of dictator. As a matter of fact, the postulate equivalent to transitive explanations will be always satisfied by our basic operators. We prove some relationships between these new postulates and the classical postulates of merging. Then we establish a general result of impossibility: The epistemic state merging operators satisfying standard domain and independence are, in fact, dictatorial operators.</paragraph><paragraph>It is worth to note that, due to the fact that our notion of epistemic states has rich instantiations, our general impossibility theorem has instantiations in rich representations of epistemic states as those mentioned before: ordinal conditional functions, rational consequence relations and total pre-orders.</paragraph><paragraph>It is interesting to highlight that our approach makes a strong use of the standard domain postulate. However, this postulate is incompatible with the representation of epistemic states as propositional formulas. Actually, we will prove that such kind of representation is not rich enough in order to satisfy standard domain. This result strengthens the utility and the necessity of considering complex epistemic states.</paragraph><paragraph>Our dictator notion is actually a weak notion of dictator: at the level of beliefs, the result of the merging entails the beliefs of the dictator. It is for this notion that our impossibility theorem holds. But this theorem does not hold for a strong version of dictator, namely, that the result of the merging, at the level of beliefs, be equivalent to the beliefs of the dictator. This will be seen with some examples of operators at work.</paragraph><paragraph>As a matter of fact, in order to have a better road map of the postulates here considered and their relationships, we consider concrete spaces, namely those where the epistemic states are total pre-orders over interpretations, and we define some examples of operators for which the satisfaction of postulates is analyzed. One important thing that our examples reveal, is that neither the standard domain postulate, nor independence postulate (nor even unanimity) are necessary conditions in order to have dictatorial operators.</paragraph><paragraph>This work is organized as follows: Section 2 is devoted to defining the concepts used throughout the paper. Section 3 is devoted to giving the syntactical postulates and their semantical counterparts and then to establish the basic representation theorems. In Section 4, we introduce the new postulates coming from social choice and state a general impossibility theorem, the main result of the paper. In Section 5, we construct operators in a concrete class of epistemic states. Section 6 is devoted to show that our impossibility result actually generalizes the classical Arrow's impossibility theorem. Finally, we make some concluding remarks in Section 7. We have also included two appendices in which we treat the more technical aspects of this work. In Appendix A we present some important results about the behavior of ES fusion operators with respect to coalitions between agents. This is necessary for the proof of our main result. The proofs are in Appendix B.</paragraph></section><section label="2"><section-title>Preliminaries</section-title><paragraph>In this section we introduce very succinctly, some fundamental notions and tools necessary for developing the main ideas of the work. Particularly, we establish some basic notions concerning orderings, belief bases and epistemic states. Also the main notions in belief merging and social choice theory are introduced.</paragraph><section label="2.1"><section-title>Orderings</section-title><paragraph>Let A be a set. A binary relation ⪰ over A is a total preorder if it is total (therefore reflexive) and transitive. Let ⪰ be a total preorder over A. We define the strict relation ≻ and the indifference ≃ associated to ⪰ as follows: {a mathematical formula}a≻biff a⪰b and b⪰̸a; {a mathematical formula}a≃b iff a⪰b and b⪰a. It is clear that any linear order is a total preorder.</paragraph><paragraph>Let ⪰ be a total preorder over A and C be a subset of A. We say that c is a maximal element (minimal element respectively) of C with respect to ⪰ if {a mathematical formula}c∈C and for all {a mathematical formula}x∈C,c⪰x ({a mathematical formula}x⪰c respectively). The set of maximal elements of C will be denoted {a mathematical formula}max⁡(C,⪰) and {a mathematical formula}min⁡(C,⪰) will denote the set of the minimal elements of C, with respect to ⪰. The set of maximal elements (minimal elements respectively) of the whole set A will be denoted {a mathematical formula}max⁡(⪰) ({a mathematical formula}min⁡(⪰) respectively). We will denote by {a mathematical formula}⪰↾C the restriction of ⪰ to C. The set of total preorders over a set A will be denoted by {a mathematical formula}P(A).</paragraph><paragraph>Let us introduce an important example of total preorder: the lexicographical combination of two total preorders. Let A be a nonempty set and let {a mathematical formula}⪰1 and {a mathematical formula}⪰2 be two total preorders over A. We define {a mathematical formula}⪰lex(⪰1,⪰2) over A by putting:{a mathematical formula} It is not hard to see that {a mathematical formula}⪰lex(⪰1,⪰2) is a total preorder over A and that the following equality holds:{a mathematical formula} Moreover, it is also easy to show that if either {a mathematical formula}⪰1 or {a mathematical formula}⪰2, is a linear order, then {a mathematical formula}⪰lex(⪰1,⪰2) is also a linear order.</paragraph><paragraph>Sometimes it is useful to associate some ranking functions to the total preorders over a set A. These are functions {a mathematical formula}f:A→R determining the total preorder ⪰ over A by {a mathematical formula}a⪰b if, and only if {a mathematical formula}f(a)≥f(b). Actually, we define the canonical ranking function, {a mathematical formula}r⪰, associated to a total preorder ⪰ over A by putting{a mathematical formula}</paragraph></section><section label="2.2"><section-title>Belief bases and epistemic states</section-title><paragraph>Next we present two ways for representing the information of an agent: belief bases and epistemic states. In order to do this let us consider a set of propositional formulas {a mathematical formula}LP built over a finite set {a mathematical formula}P of atomic propositions. {a mathematical formula}LP⁎ will denote the set of non contradictory formulas. {a mathematical formula}LP⁎/≡ will denote the set of non contradictory formulas modulo logical equivalence. Let {a mathematical formula}WP be the set of interpretations of formulas in {a mathematical formula}LP. If φ is a formula in {a mathematical formula}LP, we denote by {a mathematical formula}〚φ〛 the set of its models, i.e.{a mathematical formula}〚φ〛={w∈WP:w⊨φ}. If {a mathematical formula}φi is a formula in {a mathematical formula}LP, for each {a mathematical formula}i∈I (where I is a finite set of indexes), we denote by {a mathematical formula}{an inline-figure}i∈Iφi the conjunction of all the formulas {a mathematical formula}φi with i in I. When I is the empty set, {a mathematical formula}{an inline-figure}i∈Iφi≡⊤. If M is a nonempty set of interpretations, we denote by {a mathematical formula}φM a formula such that {a mathematical formula}〚φM〛=M.</paragraph><paragraph>A belief base is a finite set of formulas in {a mathematical formula}LP. It encodes the set of propositions believed by an agent anytime, the propositions which are obtained as a logical consequence of this finite set. A belief base can be identified (if the syntax representations are not important) to an equivalent formula. For instance, {a mathematical formula}{α1,α2,…,αn} can be identified to {a mathematical formula}α1∧α2∧⋯∧αn. Thus, in this work, a belief base will be represented by a formula φ in {a mathematical formula}LP.</paragraph><paragraph>The intuitive meaning of a (complex) epistemic state is to have, in addition to a belief base, other information, eventually null. Many concrete representations of epistemic states have been proposed. The first one is, of course, that of the AGM framework [1], [11], where an epistemic state is a logical theory. Darwiche and Pearl [7], [8] represent epistemic states by total preorders over {a mathematical formula}WP. Spohn [24] uses ordinal conditional functions. An abstract model to represent epistemic states was presented by Benferhat et al. [5]. We will adopt this abstract representation throughout this paper except in Section 5, where we consider the concrete representation of total preorders over interpretations as a realization of the abstract model.</paragraph><paragraph label="Definition 1">Epistemic spaceA triple {a mathematical formula}(E,B,LP) is called an epistemic space if {a mathematical formula}E is a nonempty set, {a mathematical formula}LP is the set of formulas over a set of propositional variables {a mathematical formula}P and B is a function from {a mathematical formula}E into {a mathematical formula}LP, such that the image of B modulo logical equivalence is all the set {a mathematical formula}LP⁎/≡.</paragraph><paragraph>The elements of {a mathematical formula}E are called epistemic states; B is called a belief function; for any E in {a mathematical formula}E, {a mathematical formula}B(E) is called the entrenchment beliefs (or belief base) of E. Notice that if I is a nonempty set of interpretations, there is E such that {a mathematical formula}B(E)≡φI, since the image of B (modulo logical equivalence) is all the set {a mathematical formula}LP⁎/≡.</paragraph><paragraph>As an example of an epistemic space we can consider a finite propositional language {a mathematical formula}LP, and then let {a mathematical formula}E be the set of all total preorders over the interpretations, that is {a mathematical formula}E=P(WP), and let B be the function that maps an epistemic state ⪰ in a formula {a mathematical formula}φ⪰ having as models the maximal elements of ⪰.</paragraph></section><section label="2.3"><section-title>IC merging operators</section-title><paragraph>We present briefly the KPP framework for merging operators of belief bases [17], [19].</paragraph><paragraph>A profile Ψ is a nonempty multi-set (bag) of belief bases {a mathematical formula}Ψ={φ1,…,φn} (hence different agents are allowed to exhibit identical bases), and represents a group of n agents. We denote by {a mathematical formula}G the set of profiles.</paragraph><paragraph>We denote by {a mathematical formula}{an inline-figure}Ψ the conjunction of bases of {a mathematical formula}Ψ={φ1,…,φn}, i.e., {a mathematical formula}{an inline-figure}Ψ=φ1∧…∧φn.

The multi-set union is noted ⊔. By abuse of notation we will write φ instead of {a mathematical formula}{φ} (a profile with a unique belief base); thus, we will write {a mathematical formula}φ⊔Ψ instead of {a mathematical formula}{φ}⊔Ψ. Two profiles are equivalent, denoted {a mathematical formula}Ψ1≡Ψ2, if there is a bijective function f from {a mathematical formula}Ψ1 onto {a mathematical formula}Ψ2 such that for any {a mathematical formula}φ∈Ψ1, {a mathematical formula}f(φ)≡φ.</paragraph><paragraph>All merging operators considered in this framework are functions from the set of profiles and the set of propositional formulae (that will represent integrity constraints) to the set of belief bases, i.e. {a mathematical formula}Δ:G×LP↦LP.

In what follows, we present a systematic study of fusion in the setting of more complex information, namely epistemic states. In particular, in this section, we begin by defining the profiles of epistemic states (given by functions); then we present postulates adapted from [21] (they are extensions of postulates of the KPP framework) and finally we establish representation results.</paragraph><section label="3.1"><section-title>Epistemic state profiles</section-title><paragraph>In order to introduce the notion of epistemic state profile, we consider an epistemic space {a mathematical formula}(E,B,LP) and a well ordered set {a mathematical formula}(S,&lt;) the elements{sup:3} of which are called agents.

Thus, if {a mathematical formula}N={i1,i2,…,in} is a finite society of agents, it can be seen as an ordered tuple: {a mathematical formula}Φ=(Ei1,Ei2,…,Ein). When N is a singleton, suppose {a mathematical formula}N={i}, by abuse, {a mathematical formula}Ei will denote the N-profile {a mathematical formula}Φ=(Ei). In that case we write i-profile instead of {a mathematical formula}{i}-profile. Given N in {a mathematical formula}F⁎(S), the set of N-profiles will be denoted {a mathematical formula}EN. The set of all profiles of epistemic states will be denoted {a mathematical formula}P(S,E), that is, {a mathematical formula}P(S,E)=⋃N∈F⁎(S)EN.</paragraph><paragraph>Let {a mathematical formula}N={i1,i2,…,in} and {a mathematical formula}M={j1,j2,…,jm} be two finite societies of agents in {a mathematical formula}S. Consider an N-profile {a mathematical formula}Φ=(Ei1,Ei2,…,Ein) and an M-profile {a mathematical formula}Ψ=(Ej1,Ej2,…,Ejm). We say that Φ and Ψ are equivalent, denoted {a mathematical formula}Φ≡Ψ, if {a mathematical formula}n=m and {a mathematical formula}Eik=Ejk for {a mathematical formula}k=1,…,n. If Φ and Ψ are not equivalent, we write {a mathematical formula}Φ≢Ψ. From this, for any pair of agents i, j in {a mathematical formula}S, if we consider an i-profile {a mathematical formula}Ei and j-profile {a mathematical formula}Ej, then {a mathematical formula}Ei≡Ej iff, seen as epistemic states, we have {a mathematical formula}Ei=Ej. Thus, by abuse and being clear from the context, we write respectively {a mathematical formula}Ei=Ej and {a mathematical formula}Ei≠Ej instead of {a mathematical formula}Ei≡Ej and {a mathematical formula}Ei≢Ej.

Most of them are adapted from IC merging postulates proposed by Konieczny and Pino Pérez [16], [17], [18] (a first version of these postulates appeared in [21]). Since the beliefs of epistemic states constitute their only aspect with well known logical structure, we express the rationality postulates in logical terms at the level of beliefs.

They represent the condition that revision be accomplished with minimal change, stating that the notion of closeness is well-behaved. More precisely these postulates establish some conditions about integrity constraints' ‘conjunctions’. For instance, if an alternative A is chosen among a set of alternatives, then if the set of alternatives is narrowed, but the alternative A remains in this set, the alternative A will be still chosen. They correspond to postulates (IC7) and (IC8) of IC merging operators respectively.</paragraph><paragraph>These four postulates, (ESF1)–(ESF4), are called basic epistemic state fusion postulates.

When an assignment preserves the structure of epistemic states we also say that the assignment is structure preserving. Note that these assignments trivially are basic assignments that satisfy Property 1.</paragraph><paragraph>From the definition (3), in addition to the equations (1) and (B-Rep), it is possible to build an ES basic fusion operator {a mathematical formula}∇F associated to an aggregation function F as follows:{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>Thanks to the equation above we define two aggregation-based ES basic fusion operators: {a mathematical formula}∇Σ (sum) and {a mathematical formula}∇max (max), defined from the aggregation functions sum and max respectively.</paragraph><paragraph>Another class of ES combination operators are given in terms of projections or variants of this.

In particular, we show which postulates from the set of postulates previously established are satisfied.</paragraph><paragraph>From the properties of sum and max it is easy to see that sum operator is really an ES fusion operator, unlike max operator which is simply an ES quasifusion operator because it satisfaces (ESF8W), but (ESF8) does not hold.</paragraph><paragraph>Also let us note that operators defined by aggregation functions satisfy (ESF-SD). This is because they are structure preserving and the freedom one has for building different preorders through its assignment.</paragraph><paragraph>Note that the sum operator satisfies (ESF-U), since (ESF2), (ESF7) and (ESF8) hold (see Proposition 4). Moreover, it is easy to verify that the max operator also satisfies the unanimity condition but does not satisfy (ESF8), showing that (ESF7) and (ESF8) are together a sufficient but not a necessary condition for (ESF-U) to hold.</paragraph><paragraph>Also, sum and max operators satisfy (ESF-P). This is because (ESF7) and (ESF8W) hold (see Proposition 6).</paragraph><paragraph>Furthermore, under the symmetry property of aggregation functions, it is easy to see that aggregation-based ES basic fusion operators are not dictatorial operators. In particular, sum and max operators are not dictatorial operators. Thus, by the main impossibility theorem, these operators do not satisfy (ESF-I), because (ESF-SD) and (ESF-P) hold. Moreover, since these operators satisfy (ESF-U) and (ESF-P) but do not satisfy (ESF-I), we have that, modulo the unanimity condition, the Pareto condition does not entail independence condition; that is, one of the converses of Proposition 9 does not hold.</paragraph><paragraph>The projective operator satisfies (ESF5), (ESF7) and (ESF8W), but (ESF6) and (ESF8) do not hold, as we show in Proposition 18 (see Appendix B). Otherwise, as we can see in Proposition 19 (see Appendix B), linearized projective operators satisfy (ESF7), (ESF8) and (ESF8W), but do not satisfy neither (ESF5) nor (ESF6). Moreover, as we show in Proposition 20 (see Appendix B), quasilinearized projective operators satisfy (ESF5) and (ESF8W) but do not satisfy neither (ESF6), (ESF7) nor (ESF8). The Σ-pseudoprojective operator satisfies (ESF5) and (ESF6), but (ESF7), (ESF8) and (ESF8W) do not hold (see Appendix B, Proposition 21).</paragraph><paragraph>In Proposition 18, Proposition 19, Proposition 20, Proposition 21, we also show that the projective-based ES fusion operators previously defined are dictatorial operators, that is, satisfy (ESF-D). Thus, by Proposition 11, the operators in this class of ES basic fusion operators also satisfy the Pareto condition, that is, (ESF-P) holds. Moreover, in these results we can see that the projective, quasilinearized projective and the Σ-pseudoprojective operators satisfy (ESF-SD), unlike linearized projective operators that do not satisfy it. There we also show that the projective, linearized and quasilinearized projective operators satisfy the independence condition, (ESF-I), unlike the Σ-pseudoprojective operator which does not satisfy it.</paragraph><paragraph>Furthermore, Proposition 18, Proposition 19, Proposition 21 also show respectively that, the projective, linearized projective and the Σ-pseudoprojective operators satisfy the unanimity condition, (ESF-U), unlike quasilinearized projective operators which do not satisfy it, as we show in Proposition 20. Thus, satisfaction of the Pareto condition does not imply satisfaction of the unanimity condition, even if the independence condition holds, that is, the other converse of Proposition 9 does not hold.</paragraph><paragraph>Table 2 shows the properties satisfied by the previously defined operators in a synthesized way, offering a landscape of the rational properties that satisfy those operators. In this table, and for the operators pointed in the first column, ✓shows the satisfaction of the property indicated at the top of its column, while ✕ denotes that such property does not hold.</paragraph><paragraph>As the main impossibility theorem establishes, in order to see that an ES fusion basic operator is dictatorial, it is enough to see that it satisfies (ESF-SD), (ESF-P) and (ESF-I). However, as shown in Table 2, the Σ-pseudoprojective operator is an example of a dictatorial operator that does not satisfy the independence condition, (ESF-I). Furthermore, we can see that linearized projective operators are dictatorial operators which do not satisfy (ESF-SD). All this shows in a finer way that these three properties are not necessary conditions for an ES basic fusion operator to be dictatorial.</paragraph><paragraph>We will now return back to Example 2 in order to show how sum, max, projective and Σ-pseudoprojective operators work.</paragraph><paragraph label="Example 2 revisited">Anne and Bob have to travel from point A to point B. There are four paths to accomplish the travel: {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2, {a mathematical formula}w3 and {a mathematical formula}w4. We will use a language with four propositional variables {a mathematical formula}{p1,…,p4}. The sentence “to travel using path {a mathematical formula}wi” is represented by the formula {a mathematical formula}φi defined by {a mathematical formula}pi∧{an inline-figure}j=1,j≠i4¬pj. By abuse of notation, define {a mathematical formula}w1=1000, {a mathematical formula}w2=0100, {a mathematical formula}w3=0010, {a mathematical formula}w4=0001. Thus {a mathematical formula}〚φi〛={wi}As Anne thinks that {a mathematical formula}wi is better than {a mathematical formula}wi+1 for {a mathematical formula}i=1,2,3, her epistemic state can be represented by {a mathematical formula}⪰A, where {a mathematical formula}w1≻Aw2≻Aw3≻Aw4 (see Fig. 1(a)). Concerning Bob, as he thinks that the best way to do the travel is {a mathematical formula}w4 and the other possibilities are equally good, his epistemic state can be represented by {a mathematical formula}⪰B, where {a mathematical formula}w4≻Bwi for {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,3, and {a mathematical formula}wi≃Bwj for {a mathematical formula}i,j=1,2,3 (see Fig. 1(b)).Now, since Anne and Bob hate heavy traffic, and the last news about the traffic inform that there are enormous traffic jams in paths {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w4, whereas on paths {a mathematical formula}w2 and {a mathematical formula}w3 there is light traffic, the integrity constraints will be encoded by the total preorder ⪰ represented in Fig. 1(c).Note that, in this problem, the interpretations having two or more 1's in its entries and the interpretation having only zeros in its entries do not make sense and therefore they will be the less preferred in the representation of epistemic states and in the integrity constraints. Thus, all these interpretations are the minimal elements of the preorders in Fig. 1, and they are represented through the thick line at the bottom of these orderings.In this case {a mathematical formula}Φ=(⪰A,⪰B) is the profile of epistemic states to be considered in the merging process. Thus, the global epistemic states associated to this profile, the preorders {a mathematical formula}⪰ΦΣ, {a mathematical formula}⪰Φmax, {a mathematical formula}⪰Φπ and {a mathematical formula}⪰ΦΣ−Pπ are graphically represented in Fig. 2. Let us note that the calculations (using the aggregation functions sum and max) leading to these total preorders are showed in Table 3.From Table 3 it is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}⪰ΦΣ=⪰Φmax. This ordering is represented in Fig. 2(a) where F will denote both sum and max aggregation functions, since these two aggregation functions give the same output in this case. By definition, we have that {a mathematical formula}⪰Φπ is exactly the epistemic state of Bob, that is, {a mathematical formula}⪰Φπ=⪰B (see Fig. 2(b)). Finally, since {a mathematical formula}⪰ΦΣ−Pπ=⪰lex(⪰B,⪰ΦΣ), we have the following: first, {a mathematical formula}w4 is the unique model on the top of {a mathematical formula}⪰ΦΣ−Pπ, because {a mathematical formula}w4 is the maximal element of {a mathematical formula}⪰B. Second, since {a mathematical formula}wi≃Bwi+1 and {a mathematical formula}wi≻ΦΣwi+1, for {a mathematical formula}i=1,2, we have {a mathematical formula}wi≻ΦΣ−Pπwi+1. Third, since the rest of the interpretations are minimal elements in both {a mathematical formula}⪰B and {a mathematical formula}⪰ΦΣ, the preorder {a mathematical formula}⪰ΦΣ−Pπ maintains them at the bottom. A graphical representation of {a mathematical formula}⪰ΦΣ−Pπ can be seen in Fig. 2(c).Therefore, the epistemic states resulting by each merging process, represented in Fig. 3, are given by the lexicographical combination of the integrity constraints ⪰, with the output of each assignment: sum, max, projective and Σ-pseudoprojective. Let us note that the models of the beliefs of the epistemic state resulting from each merging process are those on the top of the preorders in Fig. 3.With the sum and max operators, Anne and Bob agree that path {a mathematical formula}w2 is the best option. This is due to the fact that, among the optimal paths, given the integrity constraints (paths {a mathematical formula}w2 and {a mathematical formula}w3), path {a mathematical formula}w2 is the closest to the preferences of both. Paths {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w4, despite being the first preference for Anne and Bob respectively, are not models of the belief of the resulting epistemic state. However, path {a mathematical formula}w1 is closer to the preferences of Anne and Bob than path {a mathematical formula}w4. Thus, their preferences for traveling in this case are: path {a mathematical formula}w2 is the first option; the second option is path {a mathematical formula}w3, followed by path {a mathematical formula}w1 and finally {a mathematical formula}w4 is the last option (see Fig. 3(a)).Note that if there are no integrity constraints, the resulting preference in the case of the sum and max operators, is given by the preorder of Fig. 2(a) which corresponds to the informal description shown in Example 2.In case of using the projective operator, Bob's preferences determine the result. Thus, the optimal paths given by the constraints, {a mathematical formula}w2 and {a mathematical formula}w3, are indifferent for Bob, and so the decision is to travel by either path {a mathematical formula}w2 or {a mathematical formula}w3. For the rest of the paths, let us note that Bob prefers path {a mathematical formula}w4 over {a mathematical formula}w1. Thus, the global preference, given the integrity constraints, will be to take either path {a mathematical formula}w2 or path {a mathematical formula}w3 for traveling as first option; the second option will be path {a mathematical formula}w4, and {a mathematical formula}w1 will be the last option (see Fig. 3(b)).Finally, in case of using the Σ-pseudoprojective operator, let us note the following: on one hand, since {a mathematical formula}w2 and {a mathematical formula}w3 are indifferent for Bob, Anne and Bob together agree that path {a mathematical formula}w2 is better than {a mathematical formula}w3. On the other hand, Bob prefers path {a mathematical formula}w4 over path {a mathematical formula}w1, and this relation will be preserved by the global preference of them. Thus, the global preference for traveling will be: path {a mathematical formula}w2 as the first option; the second option is path {a mathematical formula}w3, followed by path {a mathematical formula}w4 as third option and finally {a mathematical formula}w1 is the last option (see Fig. 3(c)).</paragraph></section></section><section label="6"><section-title>Generalizing Arrow's theorem</section-title><paragraph>In this section we show how our main impossibility theorem (Theorem 7) generalizes Arrow's theorem, which is part of the framework of social choice theory. In order to do this, we adapt the social properties previously presented in the ES fusion operators framework to the case of restricted profiles, that is, profiles built from some specific epistemic states previously chosen.</paragraph><paragraph>From now on, we suppose that an epistemic space {a mathematical formula}(E,B,LP) is given, where {a mathematical formula}P is a set with at least two atomic propositions and {a mathematical formula}S is a well ordered set of agents. Let {a mathematical formula}W⁎ be a subset of {a mathematical formula}WP with at least three interpretations, {a mathematical formula}E⁎ be the set of all epistemic states in {a mathematical formula}E such that its beliefs have all their models in {a mathematical formula}W⁎.

In order to show this, we consider a finite and nonempty set A with m alternatives ({a mathematical formula}m≥3) and a finite set of individuals (agents) {a mathematical formula}N={i1,…,in}. Let k be the least nonnegative integer such that {a mathematical formula}m≤2k. Assume that {a mathematical formula}P(A) is the set of all the preferences (total preorders) over A. We define {a mathematical formula}S=N with the order of the subindexes, that is {a mathematical formula}ij&lt;ik if {a mathematical formula}j&lt;k.</paragraph><paragraph>Let {a mathematical formula}P be a set with k atomical propositions. Suppose that the set of epistemic states is the set of total preorders over {a mathematical formula}WP, that is, {a mathematical formula}E=P(WP). Also suppose that {a mathematical formula}〚B(⪰)〛=max⁡(⪰), for each epistemic state ⪰ in {a mathematical formula}E, and let {a mathematical formula}σ:A→WP be an injection from A to {a mathematical formula}WP.</paragraph><paragraph>First, if σ is surjective ({a mathematical formula}m=2k) then each preorder over A can be seen as a preorder over {a mathematical formula}WP, modulo σ. That is, given a total preorder ⪰ over A, we define the total preorder {a mathematical formula}⪰⁎ over {a mathematical formula}WP as follows: for every pair w, {a mathematical formula}w′ in {a mathematical formula}WP; {a mathematical formula}w⪰⁎w′iff{a mathematical formula}σ−1(w)⪰σ−1(w′). On the other hand, if σ is not a surjection ({a mathematical formula}m&lt;2k), then we define the epistemic state {a mathematical formula}⪰⁎ associated to ⪰ as follows:</paragraph><list><list-item label="(a)">{a mathematical formula}min⁡(⪰⁎)=WP∖σ(A)</list-item><list-item label="(b)">For every pair w, {a mathematical formula}w′ in {a mathematical formula}σ(A); {a mathematical formula}w⪰⁎w′iff{a mathematical formula}σ−1(w)⪰σ−1(w′)</list-item></list><paragraph> for every preference ⪰ over A. By abuse of notation, the map {a mathematical formula}⪰↦⪰⁎ will be called also σ, that is, {a mathematical formula}σ:P(A)⟶P(WP) is the function defined by {a mathematical formula}σ(⪰)=⪰⁎. This function is clearly injective.</paragraph><paragraph>To illustrate the previous definitions, first suppose that {a mathematical formula}A={x,y,z,t} is the set of alternatives and let {a mathematical formula}WP be a set with exactly four interpretations. Let {a mathematical formula}⪰⁎ the preference determined by: {a mathematical formula}x≻y, {a mathematical formula}x≻z, {a mathematical formula}y≃z and {a mathematical formula}y≻t (see Fig. 4(a)). Thus {a mathematical formula}⪰⁎, the total preorder associated to ⪰, preserves that ordering between the images of alternatives: {a mathematical formula}σ(x)≻⁎σ(y), {a mathematical formula}σ(x)≻⁎σ(z), {a mathematical formula}σ(y)≃⁎σ(z) and {a mathematical formula}σ(y)≻⁎σ(t), as we can also see in Fig. 4(a). Now consider the case where {a mathematical formula}A={x,y,z}. We take again {a mathematical formula}WP to be a set with exactly four interpretations. Let {a mathematical formula}⪰⁎ be the preference determined by: {a mathematical formula}x≻y, {a mathematical formula}x≻z and {a mathematical formula}y≃z (see Fig. 4(b)). Thus {a mathematical formula}⪰⁎, the total preorder associated to ⪰, preserves that ordering between the images of alternatives: {a mathematical formula}σ(x)≻⁎σ(y), {a mathematical formula}σ(x)≻⁎σ(z), {a mathematical formula}σ(y)≃⁎σ(z) and puts the elements which are not in the image of σ at the bottom as we can see in Fig. 4(b).</paragraph><paragraph>Let {a mathematical formula}E⁎ be the image of σ, i.e., {a mathematical formula}E⁎={⪰⁎∈P(WP):∃⪰∈P(A) such that σ(⪰)=⪰⁎}. Thus, σ is a bijection between {a mathematical formula}P(A) and {a mathematical formula}E⁎.</paragraph><paragraph>From this last application we can build a bijection {a mathematical formula}u↦Φu between the set of N-profiles of preferences over A and the set of restricted N-profiles over {a mathematical formula}E⁎, defined as follows: if {a mathematical formula}u=(⪰i1,…,⪰in), then {a mathematical formula}Φu=(⪰i1⁎,…,⪰in⁎). Again, by abuse of notation, it is natural to call this map σ. Thus, {a mathematical formula}σ:(P(A))n⟶(P(WP))n where {a mathematical formula}σ(u)=Φu. As before, σ is a bijection between {a mathematical formula}(P(A))n (the set of N-profiles of preferences over A) and {a mathematical formula}(E⁎)N (the set of restricted N-profiles over {a mathematical formula}E⁎).</paragraph><paragraph>Now, let {a mathematical formula}F:(P(A))n×P⁎(A)→P⁎(A) be a social choice function which satisfies standard domain and transitive explanations. In particular, there exists one unique social welfare function {a mathematical formula}u↦⪰u defining F through Equation (3). Let us note that standard domain entails that the social welfare function is total; that is, it associates a global preference {a mathematical formula}⪰u over A, to each profile of preferences u. Using this total social welfare function {a mathematical formula}u↦⪰u, it is possible to define an assignment {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰Φ for restricted N-profiles over {a mathematical formula}E⁎, as follows: first, if Φ is a restricted N-profile over {a mathematical formula}E⁎, we associate to it an N-profile {a mathematical formula}uΦ of preferences over A through the bijection σ, actually {a mathematical formula}uΦ=σ−1(Φ). Then, through the social welfare function {a mathematical formula}u↦⪰u, we associate to {a mathematical formula}uΦ a global preference {a mathematical formula}⪰uΦ over A. Finally, using the bijection σ again, the preference {a mathematical formula}⪰uΦ over A is mapped to an epistemic state {a mathematical formula}⪰Φ defined as {a mathematical formula}⪰uΦ⁎ in {a mathematical formula}E⁎. This process can be schematized in Fig. 5.</paragraph><paragraph>This assignment can be extended to a basic assignment which is structure preserving in the following way: If Φ is a profile of size one that is {a mathematical formula}Φ=(⪰i) with {a mathematical formula}i∈S then {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰i; if Φ is an M-profile such that a restricted N-profile Ψ satisfying {a mathematical formula}Φ≡Ψ exists, then {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰Ψ where {a mathematical formula}⪰Ψ is defined as in Fig. 5; finally, if Φ is not of size one and it is not equivalent to a restricted N-profile, we put {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰, where ⪰ is a fixed element of {a mathematical formula}E. It is clear that {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰Ψ is a basic assignment.</paragraph><paragraph>From this basic assignment we can define an ES basic fusion operator {a mathematical formula}∇F:P(S,E)×E⟶E in the following way:{a mathematical formula}</paragraph><paragraph>Note that the restriction of {a mathematical formula}∇F to {a mathematical formula}(E⁎)N×E⁎ has its images in {a mathematical formula}E⁎. It is also interesting to remark that {a mathematical formula}∇F can simulate F. Actually, if X is an agenda, we can associate to X an epistemic state {a mathematical formula}⪰σ(X) in {a mathematical formula}E⁎ such that {a mathematical formula}max⁡(⪰σ(X))=σ(X). Moreover, it is easy to see that if u is an N-profile of preferences over A, the behavior of F on the input {a mathematical formula}(u,X) can be recovered from the behavior of {a mathematical formula}∇F on the input {a mathematical formula}(Φu,⪰σ(X)), where {a mathematical formula}Φu=σ(u). More precisely, we have the following equation:{a mathematical formula} that is, {a mathematical formula}σ−1(max(⪰lex(⪰σ(X),⪰Φ)))=max(X,⪰u). In Fig. 6 we can see this simulation.</paragraph><paragraph>A consequence of Equation (5) is that if {a mathematical formula}∇F is dictatorial, i.e., it satisfies (ESF-D{sup:⁎}), then F is dictatorial.</paragraph><paragraph label="Observation 2">As the assignment is structure preserving, it is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}∇F satisfy (ESF-SD{sup:⁎}).</paragraph><paragraph>Note also that many social properties of the ES basic fusion operator {a mathematical formula}∇F restricted to the triple {a mathematical formula}W⁎, {a mathematical formula}E⁎, N, are inherited from the social properties of the social choice function F. This is established in the following result.</paragraph><paragraph label="Proposition 12">Let{a mathematical formula}F:(P(A))n×P⁎(A)→P⁎(A)be a social choice function which satisfies standard domain and transitive explanation, and suppose that{a mathematical formula}u↦⪰uis the welfare function associated to F.

We have also introduced new postulates with a more social flavor. These postulates, except standard domain, have been characterized semantically (Proposition 5, Proposition 7, Proposition 8, Proposition 10). We have shown some tight relationships between the merging postulates and the social postulates; in particular, the ES quasifusion operators satisfy the Pareto condition (Proposition 6) and the ES fusion operators satisfy the unanimity condition (Proposition 4). Actually, unlike the other social postulates, the standard domain postulate has a formulation which is very near to a semantical one, as Observation 1 establishes.</paragraph><paragraph>The social postulates together with the basic fusion postulates are enough to prove a general impossibility theorem: the ES basic fusion operators satisfying the standard domain, Pareto and independence conditions are indeed dictatorial operators (Theorem 7). Moreover, the ES fusion operators satisfying the standard domain postulate and the independence condition are dictatorial operators (Corollary 1).</paragraph><paragraph>One very interesting feature of our approach is that it gives interesting instantiations of the impossibility theorem (Theorem 7) for different representations of epistemic states. Thus, this applies to ordinal conditional functions, rational relations, and of course total preorders. However, the representation of epistemic states as formulas does not work because it is impossible to have standard domain in presence of a good representation of beliefs, namely the maximality condition. This fact highlights the necessity of using complex epistemic states.</paragraph><paragraph>The concrete examples of Section 5 show that the standard domain and independence are not necessary conditions in order to have a dictatorial operator (see Table 2).</paragraph><paragraph>Having established the impossibility Theorem, it is natural to ask for general results of manipulability. We have some work in progress in this direction.</paragraph><paragraph>At the moment, we don't have an example of an ES fusion or quasifusion operator which is at the same time a dictatorial operator. We conjecture that such kind of operators exists.</paragraph><paragraph>We think that Theorem 6 can be generalized to an arbitrary number of models greater than 4. However, the combinatorial analysis seems very complicated.</paragraph><paragraph>Finally, an interesting problem, open for further work, is to find a characterization of dictatorial operators.</paragraph><section-title>Acknowledgements</section-title></section></content><acknowledgements><paragraph>Thanks to the CDCHTA-ULA for its financial support to the Project No. H-1538-16-05-C.

Thus, by Proposition 15, we have {a mathematical formula}Ew,w″D∇⁎Ew.Since {a mathematical formula}Ew,w″D∇Ew″, by Proposition 16, it follows {a mathematical formula}Ew′,w″D∇⁎Ew″.Since {a mathematical formula}Ew′,w″D∇⁎Ew″, by Observation 3, we have {a mathematical formula}Ew′,w″D∇Ew″. Then, by Proposition 15, we have {a mathematical formula}Ew,w′D∇⁎Ew.Now, let </list><paragraph>{a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2 be a pair of different interpretations. If either {a mathematical formula}w1 or {a mathematical formula}w2, is in {a mathematical formula}{w,w′}, from the above statements we have {a mathematical formula}Ew1,w2D∇⁎Ew2. Hence, we suppose that both {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2 are not elements of {a mathematical formula}{w,w′}. Since {a mathematical formula}Ew,w′D∇Ew′, by Proposition 16, we have {a mathematical formula}Ew1,w′D∇⁎Ew′, and thus {a mathematical formula}Ew1,w′D∇Ew′. From this, by Proposition 15, {a mathematical formula}Ew1,w2D∇⁎Ew2. □</paragraph></paragraph><paragraph label="Proof of Theorem 7">Let N be a finite society of agents in {a mathematical formula}S. Define the following set:{a mathematical formula} Since we have (ESF-P), by Observation 3, N is decisive. Thus, {a mathematical formula}X is nonempty. Let D be an element of {a mathematical formula}X having minimal cardinality. Since D is decisive then {a mathematical formula}D≠∅, as we noted in Observation 3. Thus, by Proposition 13, it is enough to see that D has a single agent in order to prove that ∇ is dictatorial. Towards a contradiction, suppose that D has at least two agents. Let i be an agent in D. Take three different interpretations w, {a mathematical formula}w′, {a mathematical formula}w″. Let {a mathematical formula}Ew,w′, {a mathematical formula}Ew,w″, {a mathematical formula}Ew′,w″, {a mathematical formula}Ew and {a mathematical formula}Ew″ be epistemic states such that {a mathematical formula}〚B(Ew,w′)〛={w,w′}, {a mathematical formula}〚B(Ew,w″)〛={w,w″}, {a mathematical formula}〚B(Ew′,w″)〛={w′,w″}, {a mathematical formula}〚B(Ew)〛={w} and {a mathematical formula}〚B(Ew″)〛={w″}. By (ESF-SD), there exists an N-profile Φ which satisfies the following:<list>{a mathematical formula}B(∇(Ei,Ew,w′))≡φw and {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Ei,Ew′,w″))≡φw′.{a mathematical formula}B(∇(Ej,Ew,w″))≡φw″ and {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Ej,Ew′,w″))≡φw′, for all j in {a mathematical formula}D∖{i}.{a mathematical formula}B(∇(Ek,Ew,w′))≡φw and {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Ek,Ew,w″))≡φw″, for all k in {a mathematical formula}N∖D.By the statement </list><paragraph>(B.12) and (ESF1), it follows that {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Φ,Ew′,w″))≡φw′. From this and the fact that {a mathematical formula}w⊨B(∇(Φ,Ew,w′)), by (B-Rep) and the transitivity of {a mathematical formula}⪰Φ, we have that {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Φ,Ew,w″))≡φw. Therefore, we have {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Φ,Ew,w″))∧B(Ew″)⊢⊥. By (ESF-SD), there exists an N-profile {a mathematical formula}Φ″ satisfying {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Ei″,Ew,w″))∧B(Ew″)⊢⊥ and {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Ej″,Ew,w″))≡B(Ew″), for all j in {a mathematical formula}N∖{i}. Hence, {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Ej,Ew,w″))≡B(∇(Ej″,Ew,w″)), for all j in N. Then, by (ESF-I), {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Φ,Ew,w″))≡B(∇(Φ″,Ew,w″)). Thus, {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Φ″,Ew,w″))∧B(Ew″)⊢⊥, and therefore, {a mathematical formula}{i}Ew″∇Ew,w″. Then, by Proposition 17, {a mathematical formula}{i} is decisive, contradicting again the minimality of D.Now we know that D is decisive and has cardinality one. We conclude by Proposition 13. □</paragraph></paragraph><paragraph label="Proposition 18">{a mathematical formula}∇πis an ES basic fusion operator that satisfies(ESF5),(ESF7),(ESF8W),(ESF-SD),(ESF-U),(ESF-P),(ESF-I),(ESF-D), but does not satisfy(ESF6)and(ESF8).</paragraph><paragraph label="Proof">From the definition of {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰dN, we have straightforwardly that it is a basic assignment which satisfies structure preserving and therefore, Property 1 holds. Now consider N a finite society of agents in {a mathematical formula}S, and let {a mathematical formula}{N1,N2} be a partition of N. Thus, since {a mathematical formula}max⁡(N)=max⁡{max⁡(N1),max⁡(N2)}, if {a mathematical formula}w⪰dN1w′ and {a mathematical formula}w⪰dN2w′, then {a mathematical formula}w⪰dNw′, that is, Property 3 holds. Similarly we prove that the projective assignment satisfies Property 4′.To show that Property 2 does not hold, we consider a profile {a mathematical formula}Φ=(⪰1,⪰2,⪰3) such that {a mathematical formula}〚B(⪰1)〛=〚B(⪰2)〛={00} and {a mathematical formula}〚B(⪰3)〛={00,01}. Thus, {a mathematical formula}〚{an inline-figure}i∈NB(⪰i)〛={00}, and therefore {a mathematical formula}〚{an inline-figure}i∈NB(⪰i)〛≠〚B(⪰3)〛. To see that {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰dN does not satisfy Property 4, take the previous profile and consider {a mathematical formula}N1={1,2} and {a mathematical formula}N2={3}. Since {a mathematical formula}00≻201 and {a mathematical formula}00≃301, then {a mathematical formula}00≻Φ↾N101 and {a mathematical formula}00≃Φ↾N201, but {a mathematical formula}00≃Φ01.Thus, from Proposition 2, it follows that {a mathematical formula}∇π satisfies (ESF5), (ESF7) and (ESF8W), but (ESF6) and (ESF8) do not hold. Moreover, from Proposition 6, it follows that {a mathematical formula}∇π satisfies (ESF-P). Moreover, due to the freedom for building preorders over interpretations and the properties of projection and lexicographical combination, it is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}∇π also satisfies (ESF-SD), (ESF-U), (ESF-I). From this and Corollary 2, we have that it also satisfies (ESF-D). □</paragraph><paragraph label="Proposition 19">Let ≥ be a linear order over{a mathematical formula}WP.

In order to do this, by Proposition 2, it is enough to prove that {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰Φπ≥, the assignment associated to {a mathematical formula}∇π≥, satisfies the properties 3, 4 and 4′ respectively.To show that Property 3 holds, we note that, for all profile Φ, {a mathematical formula}⪰Φπ≥ is a linear order. Thus, consider N in {a mathematical formula}F⁎(S), {a mathematical formula}{N1,N2} a partition of N, let Φ be an N-profile and suppose w, {a mathematical formula}w′ is a pair of interpretations in {a mathematical formula}WP such that {a mathematical formula}w⪰Φ↾N1π≥w′ and {a mathematical formula}w⪰Φ↾N2π≥w′. If {a mathematical formula}w=w′ the result follows straightforwardly. Then, suppose that {a mathematical formula}w≠w′ and let us note that {a mathematical formula}w≻Φ↾N1π≥w′. From this we have two cases: {a mathematical formula}w≻dN1w′, or {a mathematical formula}w≃dN1w′ and {a mathematical formula}w&gt;w′. Thus, suppose that {a mathematical formula}w≻dN1w′ (the case in which {a mathematical formula}w≃dN1w′ and {a mathematical formula}w&gt;w′ is similar). Since {a mathematical formula}w≻Φ↾N2π≥w′, we also have either {a mathematical formula}w≻dN2w′ or {a mathematical formula}w≃dN2w′ and {a mathematical formula}w&gt;w′. On the one hand, if {a mathematical formula}w≻dN2w′, by virtue of {a mathematical formula}max⁡(N)=max⁡{dN1,dN2}, we have {a mathematical formula}w≻dNw′. Therefore {a mathematical formula}w≻Φπ≥w′. On the other hand, if {a mathematical formula}w≃dN2w′ and {a mathematical formula}w&gt;w′, we have that {a mathematical formula}w⪰dNw′. From this and the fact that {a mathematical formula}w&gt;w′, it follows that {a mathematical formula}w≻Φπ≥w′. Therefore, {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰Φπ≥ satisfies Property 3. Similarly we obtain that Properties 4 and 4′ hold.In order to show that a quasilinearized projective operator satisfies (ESF-U), we will prove that {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰π≥Φ satisfies property (u) given in Proposition 5. Thus, consider N in {a mathematical formula}F⁎(S), Φ an N-profile and {a mathematical formula}⪰′ an epistemic state such that {a mathematical formula}⪰i=⪰′, for all i in N. Thus, {a mathematical formula}⪰lex(⪰dN,≥)=⪰lex(⪰′,≥), showing that {a mathematical formula}⪰Φπ≥=⪰⪰′π≥.To see that (ESF-I) holds, it is enough to see that {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰Φπ≥ satisfies property (ind) given in Proposition 8. Thus, consider N in {a mathematical formula}F⁎(S), Φ and {a mathematical formula}Φ′ a pair of N-profiles, and w, {a mathematical formula}w′ two interpretations such that {a mathematical formula}⪰i↾{w,w′}=⪰i↾{w,w′}′, for all i in N. From the fact that {a mathematical formula}⪰dN↾{w,w′}=⪰dN′↾{w,w′}, we have {a mathematical formula}⪰lex(⪰dN,≥)↾{w,w′}=⪰lex(⪰dN′,≥)↾{w,w′}, that is, {a mathematical formula}⪰Φπ≥↾{w,w′}=⪰Φ′π≥↾{w,w′}.Now, since {a mathematical formula}∇π≥ satisfies unanimity and independence conditions, by Proposition 9 we have that (ESF-P) holds.In order to show that {a mathematical formula}∇π≥ satisfies (ESF-D), we will prove that its assignment satisfies Property (d) given in Proposition 10. Thus, assume N is in {a mathematical formula}F⁎(S), Φ is an N-profile and suppose that w, {a mathematical formula}w′ are interpretations in {a mathematical formula}WP such that {a mathematical formula}w≻dNw′. Then {a mathematical formula}w≻Φlex(⪰dN,≥)w′, that is {a mathematical formula}w≻Φπ≥w′, as desired.Now, given a profile Φ, since {a mathematical formula}⪰Φπ≥ is a linear order over {a mathematical formula}WP, then, for every total preorder ⪰ over {a mathematical formula}WP, we have that {a mathematical formula}⪰lex(⪰,⪰Φπ≥) is also a linear order over {a mathematical formula}WP, that is, {a mathematical formula}∇π≥(Φ,⪰) is a linear order over interpretations. From this it follows straightforwardly that {a mathematical formula}∇π≥ does not satisfy (ESF-SD).To show that {a mathematical formula}∇π≥ does not satisfy (ESF5) and (ESF6), by virtue of Proposition 2, it is enough to see that {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰Φπ≥ does not satisfy the Properties 1 and 2 respectively.To show that Property 1 does not hold, consider w, {a mathematical formula}w′ a pair of interpretations in {a mathematical formula}WP, with {a mathematical formula}w&gt;w′, and {a mathematical formula}⪰1, {a mathematical formula}⪰2 a pair of epistemic states satisfying that {a mathematical formula}w≃1w′, {a mathematical formula}w≻2w′ and {a mathematical formula}⪰1↾WP∖{w,w′}=⪰2↾WP∖{w,w′}. Thus {a mathematical formula}⪰1≠⪰2, but {a mathematical formula}⪰lex(⪰1,≥)=⪰lex(⪰2,≥). That is, {a mathematical formula}⪰⪰1π≥=⪰⪰2π≥.Finally, to see that Property 2 does not hold, consider w, {a mathematical formula}w′ a pair of interpretations in {a mathematical formula}WP such that {a mathematical formula}w&gt;w′, {a mathematical formula}N={1,2} and {a mathematical formula}Φ=(⪰1,⪰2) an N-profile with {a mathematical formula}max⁡(⪰i)={w,w′}, for {a mathematical formula}i=1,2. Thus, {a mathematical formula}〚{an inline-figure}i∈NB(⪰i)〛={w,w′} and by definition we have {a mathematical formula}max⁡(⪰Φπ≥)={w}. This shows that {a mathematical formula}〚{an inline-figure}i∈NB(⪰i)〛≠max⁡(≻Φπ≥). □</paragraph><paragraph label="Proposition 20">Let ≥ be a linear order over{a mathematical formula}WP.

Due to the freedom for building total preorders over {a mathematical formula}WP and the definition of {a mathematical formula}∇Qπ≥ it follows that it satisfies (ESF-SD). Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}∇Qπ≥ is a dictatorial operator, by Proposition 11, we have that (ESF-P) holds.In order to prove that (ESF7) and (ESF8) do not hold, by Proposition 2, it is enough to see that {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰ΦQπ≥ does not satisfy Properties 3 and 4 respectively.

From the definition of the assignment we have {a mathematical formula}w≻Φ↾N1Qπ≥w′ and {a mathematical formula}w⪰Φ↾N2Qπ≥w′, but {a mathematical formula}w′≻Qπ≥Φw.Finally, to show that (ESF-U) does not hold, consider w, {a mathematical formula}w′ a pair of interpretations in {a mathematical formula}WP, such that {a mathematical formula}w&gt;w′. Let {a mathematical formula}⪰⁎ be a total preorder over {a mathematical formula}WP such that {a mathematical formula}max⁡(⪰⁎)={w,w′}.

The result follows from Proposition 5. □</paragraph><paragraph label="Proposition 21">{a mathematical formula}∇Σ−Pπis an ES basic fusion operator that satisfies(ESF5),(ESF6),(ESF-SD),(ESF-U),(ESF-P), and(ESF-D), but does not satisfy(ESF7),(ESF8),(ESF8W)nor(ESF-I).</paragraph><paragraph label="Proof">In order too see that {a mathematical formula}∇Σ−Pπ satisfies (ESF5) and (ESF6), by Proposition 2, it is enough to see that {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰ΦΣ−Pπ satisfies Properties 1 and 2. Assume N in {a mathematical formula}F⁎(S) and consider an N-profile Φ. Let w and {a mathematical formula}w′ be a pair of interpretations. Since {a mathematical formula}⪰⪰Σ=⪰ and {a mathematical formula}⪰lex(⪰,⪰)=⪰ we have that {a mathematical formula}⪰⪰Σ−Pπ=⪰. Thus {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰ΦΣ−Pπ is structure preserving. Therefore, it satisfies Property 1.In order to show that Property 2 holds, we first suppose that w is a model of {a mathematical formula}{an inline-figure}i∈NB(⪰i). Thus, {a mathematical formula}w⊨B(⪰dN) and by the maximality condition we have that {a mathematical formula}w⪰dNw′. Since {a mathematical formula}Φ↦⪰ΦΣ satisfies 2, {a mathematical formula}w⪰ΦΣw′. Thus, {a mathematical formula}w⪰ΦΣ−Pπw′, that is, w is in {a mathematical formula}max⁡(⪰ΦΣ−Pπ). Suppose now, towards a contradiction, that w is in {a mathematical formula}max⁡(⪰ΦΣ−Pπ) and {a mathematical formula}w⊭{an inline-figure}i∈NB(⪰i). Thus, if {a mathematical formula}w′⊨{an inline-figure}i∈NB(⪰i), by 2 we have that {a mathematical formula}w′≻ΦΣw. On the other hand, since {a mathematical formula}w⪰ΦΣ−Pπw′ it satisfies either {a mathematical formula}w≻dNw′ (in this case, by the maximality condition, {a mathematical formula}w′⊭B(⪰dN)) or {a mathematical formula}w≃dNw′ and {a mathematical formula}w⪰ΦΣw′.

Thus {a mathematical formula}⪰ΦΣ=⪰′, and therefore {a mathematical formula}⪰ΦΣ−Pπ=⪰lex(⪰,⪰)=⪰. From this, the result follows using Proposition 5.Straightforward from the definition, we can see that {a mathematical formula}∇Σ−Pπ has a dictator. Thus, (ESF-D) holds. Then, by Proposition 11, (ESF-P) holds.We know that {a mathematical formula}∇Σ does not satisfy (ESF-I). Thus, by Proposition 8, there exists a society D, two D-profiles Φ and {a mathematical formula}Φ′ and two interpretations w and {a mathematical formula}w′ such that {a mathematical formula}⪰i↾{w,w′}=⪰i′↾{w,w′} for each {a mathematical formula}i∈D, but {a mathematical formula}w≻ΦΣw′ and {a mathematical formula}w′⪰Φ′Σw. Choose an agent j such that {a mathematical formula}j&gt;dD. Consider now the society {a mathematical formula}N=D∪{j} and let {a mathematical formula}⪰j be the flat preorder (all interpretations are indifferent). Let {a mathematical formula}Φ1=Φ⊔⪰j and {a mathematical formula}Φ2=Φ′⊔⪰j. It is clear that {a mathematical formula}⪰i↾{w,w′}=⪰i′↾{w,w′} for each {a mathematical formula}i∈N. We can also check that {a mathematical formula}⪰Φ1Σ−Pπ=⪰ΦΣ and {a mathematical formula}⪰Φ2Σ−Pπ=⪰Φ′Σ. Therefore, {a mathematical formula}w≻Φ1Σ−Pπw′ and {a mathematical formula}w′⪰Φ2Σ−Pπw. That is, again by Proposition 8, (ESF-I) does not hold. □</paragraph></paragraph></section></appendices><references><reference label="[1]"><authors>Carlos E.
