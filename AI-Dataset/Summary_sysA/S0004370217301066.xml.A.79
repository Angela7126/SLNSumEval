<a href="#1" id="1">We denote a set of parameters {a mathematical formula}H ′ as being open and learned in a layer of learning {a mathematical formula}Li if the set of parameters are included in the layer's learned policy representation {a mathematical formula}Hi (i.e.</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">After the Walk_GoToTarget parameter set is learned and fixed, the Walk_Sprint walk engine parameter set used to quickly walk straight forward — to targets within {a mathematical formula}15 ∘ of the robot's current heading — is then optimized in the third layer of learning using the same obstacle course optimization task.</a>
