<a href="#0" id="0">Furthermore, the out-of-domain results show that our clustering features provide a simple and easy method to improve the robustness of NERC systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Ratinov and Roth [52] used Brown clusters as features obtaining what was at the time the best published result of an English NERC system on the CoNLL 2003 testset.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Table 5 shows that three of our models outperform previous best results reported for English in the CoNLL 2003 dataset [48].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 8 compares our German CoNLL 2003 results with the best previous work trained on public data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 13 displays the F1 results of the baseline system consisting of local features and the best cluster model.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, it is striking that training our clustering features using only one eight of the training data (30K words) allows to obtain similar performance to the baseline system trained on the full training set.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The results with respect to their CoNLL model improved by around 3 points in F1 score across named entity labels and evaluation types (phrase or token based).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For German we improve the results of the best system in the GermEval 2014 task and obtain comparable results to previous work in the CoNLL 2003 dataset using publicly available data.</a>
