<a href="#0" id="0">The cost of every edge along this path is added to {a mathematical formula}g Π (s) (the states are added to {a mathematical formula} Π (s)).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, when s is truncated, the path followed in {a mathematical formula}ComputeGpi(s) routine is a valid one, with cost {a mathematical formula}g Π (s), stored in {a mathematical formula} Π (s).Now, let us assume that the Lemma statement holds for all prior truncation, and we will prove it for a current underconsistent state {a mathematical formula}s ′ which is truncated.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the path followed by {a mathematical formula}ComputeGpi(s ′ ) does not visit any truncated state then the Lemma is valid (from the earlier case).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Whereas, if it encounters a state {a mathematical formula}s ″ ∈ TRUNCATED, we augment {a mathematical formula}g Π (s ′ ) with {a mathematical formula}g Π (s ″ ) and concatenate {a mathematical formula} Π (s ″ ) to {a mathematical formula} Π (s ′ ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As {a mathematical formula}s ″ ∈ TRUNCATED, {a mathematical formula} Π (s ″ ) is valid and has cost {a mathematical formula}g Π (s ″ ) (from induction hypothesis), which means {a mathematical formula} Π (s ′ ) is valid and has cost {a mathematical formula}g Π (s ′ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This optimization ensures that D* Lite does need not to alter the Key values of states that already in OPEN (i.e., no reordering required), and also that the Key values of newly generated states maintain the lower bound on the total path cost (note that, {a mathematical formula}h(slast,sstart) ≤ c ⁎ (slast,sstart)).</a>
