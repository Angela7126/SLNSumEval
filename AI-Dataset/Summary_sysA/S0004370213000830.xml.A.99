<a href="#0" id="0">However, their work did not evaluate feature labeling in a statistical user study involving a large number of actual end users.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to evaluate our feature labeling algorithm, we perform an empirical comparison on multiple data sets under ideal conditions, using feature labels obtained from an oracle, and under real-world conditions for one particular dataset, using feature labels harvested from actual end users.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We experimented with adding one oracle feature label per class, two oracle feature labels per class, and so on until a total of ten per class were added.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These oracle feature labels were added in the order of highest information gain.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore the oracle study provides an optimistic estimate on the potential gains of using these feature labeling algorithms by providing enough ideal feature labels to benefit the algorithm and by carefully tuning the parameters of the feature labeling algorithms over a large validation set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We then used the end users ʼ data to compare the performance of the same algorithms as in our oracle study, but with smaller validation sets of size 24 (six instances for each class) to simulate a realistic scenario in which end users were able to label only a limited amount of training instances for both a training and a validation set.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A naïve implementation of matrix inversion does not scale well to large datasets since the complexity is {a mathematical formula}O(n3) for n instances (where n is the number of training and test instances) and is a roadblock to allowing LWLR-SS-FL to be applied to large datasets in an interactive setting, which is an important requirement of feature labeling [32].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis showed that LWLR-FL was robust to different parameter settings.</a>
