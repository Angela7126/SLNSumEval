<a href="#0" id="0">Formally stating the above discussion, for the special case when {a mathematical formula} Δ ijt,t ′ = Δ i ′ jt,t ′ , ∀ j,t,t ′ ,i,i ′ (i.e., a request completion decision epoch is same irrespective of the server assigned to it), we show the reduction of the OSTM to a min cost flow problem with integer capacities (Proposition 1).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Single-stage decision, i.e., decisions which do not consider future requests: In this case, at decision epoch 1 zone 1 server will be assigned to the demand element 2 and zone 2 server will be assigned to the demand element 1, i.e., {a mathematical formula}x121=1,x211=1 and rest all variables as 0.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Multi-stage decision, i.e., decisions which consider future requests: In this case, at decision epoch 1, zone 1 server will be assigned to the demand element 1 and zone 2 server will not serve any request, i.e., {a mathematical formula}x111=1 and rest all variables for decision epoch 1 are set to 0.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">At decision epoch 2 both servers will be available in the zone 2 and can serve both requests, i.e., {a mathematical formula}x212=1 and {a mathematical formula}x222=1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Proposition 5: In OLSTM with sample information and stochastic behavior from environment according to the samples, when maximizing the number of requests satisfied, the expected competitive ratio, {a mathematical formula}c Μ , of the TSS algorithm is{a mathematical formula} where M is the number of decision epochs ({a mathematical formula}M ≥ 3).</a>
