<a href="#0" id="0">The formula our present implementation uses to calculate the colorimetric contraction is:{a mathematical formula} where the colorMean of a region is the average of all colorimetric information available in that region, taking into account the multivariate nature of the underlying image as previously discussed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this example, the problem is to determine for which of the candidate images the transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ is made most analogous to transformation T. We first will represent T as a fractal representation, and then generate a set of candidate transformations Ω as shown in Fig.</a>
