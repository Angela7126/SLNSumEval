<a href="#0" id="0">For the Monroe rule with the Borda scoring function we give a randomized {a mathematical formula}(0.715 − Ε )-approximation algorithm (often, the ratio is much better; see Section 4 and the comment on Algorithm A above).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the case of an arbitrary positional scoring function we give a ({a mathematical formula}1 − 1e)-approximation algorithm (Theorem 10).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the Chamberlin – Courant rule with the Borda scoring function we give a polynomial-time approximation scheme (that is, for each Ε , {a mathematical formula}0< Ε <1, we have a polynomial-time {a mathematical formula}(1 − Ε )-approximation algorithm; see Corollary 13 and the comment on Algorithm P above).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the Borda satisfaction function, it inherits the approximation guarantees from Algorithm A, and for other cases Theorem 10 guarantees approximation ratio {a mathematical formula}1 − 1e (we do not know of any guarantees for Algorithm A for these cases).</a>
