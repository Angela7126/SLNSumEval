<a href="#0" id="0">If indeed the solution is of the form {a mathematical formula}(Rauc,Rbidder), where {a mathematical formula}Rauc ≠ Rbidder, then the bidders can benefit from deviating to (i.e., calculating {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁎ (X=x) according to) {a mathematical formula}Rbidder ′ =Rauc, since this will result in a bid that equals the bidder's expected valuation of the item in cases where no information is disclosed (whereas when {a mathematical formula}Rbidder is used the bid is either greater or lesser than the bidder's expected valuation of the item).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The analysis of the case where bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information is an instance of the case where the auctioneer needs to calculate her expected-benefit-maximizing strategy given the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, as given in Section 3.2, for {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is due to the fact that if the auctioneer discloses the value x of X then the dominating strategy for each bidder is to bid her expected private value, as before, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} Similarly, when a value is not disclosed, the dominating strategy for the bidders is to bid their expected individual private value, based on their belief of the strategy used by the auctioneer (and consequently the probability they assign to each value {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X when information is not disclosed).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We emphasize that despite the fact that the total payment that the auctioneer eventually pays the information-provider is C (for changing the price and purchasing the information), the resulting solution is different than the one obtained when the price is set to {a mathematical formula}C ′ .</a>
