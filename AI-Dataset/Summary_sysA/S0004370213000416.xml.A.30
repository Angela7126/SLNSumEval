<a href="#0" id="0">In Section 2.3 we called an aggregation procedure collectively rational with respect to a formula {a mathematical formula}ic ∈ LPS if the outcome on every rational profile satisfies the same integrity constraint ic.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We now extend this definition to collectively rational procedures with respect to a given language {a mathematical formula}L:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a language {a mathematical formula}L ⊆ LPS, call {a mathematical formula}CR[L] the class of aggregation procedures that lift all {a mathematical formula}ic ∈ L:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a class of aggregation procedures {a mathematical formula}G ⊆ F, call {a mathematical formula}LF[G] the set of integrity constraints that are lifted by all {a mathematical formula}F ∈ G:{a mathematical formula}</a>
