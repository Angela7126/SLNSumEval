<a href="#0" id="0">We empirically investigated the effects of replacing the exact hypervolume indicator with two different Monte Carlo approximations on the performance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We evaluated whether a state-of-the-art MOEA relying on hypervolume-indicator-based selection is affected by the potential errors made by approximating the least hypervolume contributor.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The results show that the performance of the algorithms in terms of the quality of the Pareto-front approximation given a budget of objective function evaluations does not suffer from the additional noise introduced by the Monte Carlo approximation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In some trials, the approximation, which introduces noise into the otherwise deterministic, greedy indicator-based selection scheme, led to better performance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We observed a vast reduction of the running time even for few objectives, when relying on the approximation scheme.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In general, the higher the number of objectives the more pronounced the performance advantage of using Monte Carlo approximation becomes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, by employing Monte Carlo approximations, hypervolume-based MOEAs become applicable to many-objective optimization.</a>
