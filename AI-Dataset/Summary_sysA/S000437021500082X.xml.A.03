<a href="#0" id="0">The L3 meta-algorithm works in 3 stages: first, it uses an RL algorithm to learn how to perform one task, storing the solution for this problem as a case in a case base; in the second stage, it maps actions of the source domain to actions of the target domain; and, in the last stage, it uses the stored cases as heuristics to speed up the Reinforcement Learning process in the target domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The application of Transfer Learning within Reinforcement Learning tasks was first proposed in [4], where an algorithm was defined that exploits strong features obtained from RL on one task in order to compose functions in a case base that is used on the solution of a new task.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The case base used in L3-SARSA( Î› ) was the one that contains N cases selected by random sampling the state set and finding the best action for that state, because this is the case base that produced the best results for the transfer.</a>
