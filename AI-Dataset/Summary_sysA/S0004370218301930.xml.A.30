<a href="#1" id="1">Algorithm 2, below, is an extended version of Algorithm 1 that handles the general version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The main difference between the algorithms is that for the general version of PGG there is no guarantee regarding the improvement of the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Nevertheless, the experimental evaluation of Section 7 demonstrates that in practice Algorithm 2 yields stable outcomes of greater efficiency than that of the initial outcome.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The lack of theoretical guarantees regarding the efficiency of the outcomes stems from the fact that according to Algorithm 1 each player may secure a transfer of payoffs to at most one of its neighbors.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This observation does not hold in the general case when {a mathematical formula}K>1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Similarly to the simple version, Algorithm 2 terminates when a pass through all the players of the game does not yield any changes to the players' strategies.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Example 2</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Reconsider the outcome {a mathematical formula}v ⁎ of Example 1 as yielded by Algorithm 2 (Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">7 depicts the improvement in social welfare of the outcomes yielded by both methods on large random networks.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Note that in this case better-response dynamics yields outcomes that are {a mathematical formula} ≈ 1% − 2% less efficient than the initial outcome.</a>
