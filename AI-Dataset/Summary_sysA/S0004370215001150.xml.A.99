<a href="#0" id="0">However condition 2 also implies that any interpretation that satisfies the Standard Names Assumption is a Herbrand interpretation for {a mathematical formula}L. As will be discussed below, this assumption will support the logic programming semantics that will be used for rules.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note also that there are important differences between the consequence operator of Definition 20 and the usual consequence operator in Logic Programming.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As the set of K-atoms inferred from a positive MKNF knowledge base is anti-monotonic with respect to elements of {a mathematical formula}M, the {a mathematical formula}TP operator, which maps an MKNF interpretation {a mathematical formula}M to the K atoms that can be inferred under the MKNF semantics, will be anti-monotonic.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The {a mathematical formula}TK operator on the other hand, maps an MKNF interpretation {a mathematical formula}M to the greatest MKNF interpretation that satisfies {a mathematical formula}TP(M) ∪ Κ (O) and so is monotonic.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Take some Α such that {a mathematical formula} Α +1< Μ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By the inductive assumption, {a mathematical formula} ⋂ Β ≤ Α X Β = Σ (M,U Α ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Language conservation is an immediate consequence of the definition of the {a mathematical formula}RD-semantics and of basic properties of the least model of a definite program.As for fact update, let {a mathematical formula}P= 〈 Pi 〉 i<n be a sequence of consistent sets of facts.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Language conservation follows by induction on i from Proposition 69 and Lemma 146.As for fact update, let {a mathematical formula}T= 〈 Ti 〉 i<n be a finite sequence of consistent sets of ground objective literals.</a>
