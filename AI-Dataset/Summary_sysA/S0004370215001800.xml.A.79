<a href="#0" id="0">Note that this definition implies that, if O is an argument graph set and {a mathematical formula}O= ∅ , then {a mathematical formula}u(O)= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For A2, again, it is plain that, in the proponent case (1), all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ u(Pi) must eventually be selected and treated according to Definition 5.5 — intuitively, all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ u(Pi) are pending proof, and if the potential argument graph is to become an actual argument graph, everything the proponent needs to support or defend must be proved.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is to be expected: there is a single grounded extension in the case of standard, tree-based semantics for {a mathematical formula}(L,R,A,ss ‾ ), of which the set of arguments found by proxdd in a grounded dispute derivation must be an admissible subset; yet there can often be many grounded argument graphs, giving rise to a larger number of solutions for the latter.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thirdly, we present the proof itself, the core of which is by induction.An argument graph dispute tree{a mathematical formula}T for {a mathematical formula}s ∈ L is defined as follows:</a>
