<a href="#0" id="0">Here we show how we can add a number of typically used data mining constraints {a mathematical formula}must – link, {a mathematical formula}cannot – link, and {a mathematical formula}must – link – before as linear constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">While global {a mathematical formula}cannot – link or {a mathematical formula}must – link constraints have been shown to improve the performance of hierarchical clustering, they were designed for flat clustering and do not take into account the hierarchical nature of a dendrogram.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Another constraint type that was specifically devised for hierarchical clustering is the {a mathematical formula}must – link – before (MLB) constraints [23].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The results for our experiment showing the difference between the ILP solutions to overlapping hierarchical clustering and the LP approximation scheme solutions are shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We evaluated our overlapping clustering formulation against standard hierarchical clustering, using Artificial Dataset 2 and presented the results in Fig.</a>
