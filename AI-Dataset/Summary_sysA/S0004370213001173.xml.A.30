<a href="#0" id="0">In order to be chosen and carried out, all these steps require prediction, but possibly with different representations and models.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Some of these steps need refinement into lower level steps (e.g., take the train), possibly using different planning techniques, others are primitives that the actor manages without explicit reasoning (e.g., sitting once at the seat).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each action in a plan may be a task that may need further refinement and planning, which will usually be done online (see below) and may require different representations, tools, and techniques from the ones that generated the task.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Such a hierarchical deliberation process differs significantly from hierarchical planning techniques (e.g., HTN planning) for reducing the search complexity of offline, non-heterogeneous plan generation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Indeed, given the advances of automated planning, the hard research issues are now precisely at the actor ʼ s level, rather than at the planner ʼ s level.</a>
