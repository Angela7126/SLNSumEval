<a href="#0" id="0">We define the social welfare of an offer O at state s between a CS player and an {a mathematical formula}SPi player to be{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Definition 1</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An offer O is a possible offer for a CS and a given {a mathematical formula}SPi player at state s if the following conditions hold:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Intuitively, if the CS player is committed to player {a mathematical formula}SPi in state s, then there is no possible path for the CS player at this state to the goal of the other {a mathematical formula}SPj player, even if the {a mathematical formula}SPj player provides all its chips to the CS player.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore the only way for the CS player to receive the bonus in the game is to reach the goal of the {a mathematical formula}SPi player.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As an example, a commitment offer at the beginning of the game shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">1 is when the {a mathematical formula}SPg proposes to send 33 red chips and 7 purple chips for 11 yellow chips.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As we will show, commitment offers play a key role in the equilibria strategies that are described in the following section.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The {a mathematical formula}SPi preferred offers at the initial state {a mathematical formula}s1, {a mathematical formula}O ˆ 1,i − are defined iteratively.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">At iteration 0, the preferred offer depends on the expected utility {a mathematical formula}Eucs(1,P1 ⁎ ) for the CS player given the preferred path {a mathematical formula}P1 ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The definition of {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is recursive.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore we show how to compute this offer using backward induction.</a>
