<a href="#0" id="0">This result yields immediate correspondence of all operator-based semantics of an ADF Ξ with the respective semantics of its standard logic program {a mathematical formula} Π ( Ξ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let{a mathematical formula} Ξ =(S,L,Cin)be an abstract dialectical framework and{a mathematical formula} Π ( Ξ )its standard logic program.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then Ξ and{a mathematical formula} Π ( Ξ )coincide on all semantics based on their approximation operators.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular, {a mathematical formula}G Ξ =T Π ( Ξ ) and an ADF and its standard logic program also agree on all semantics derived from the ultimate approximation of their two-valued operators.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the remainder, we will denote the four-valued approximation operator of an argumentation framework Θ by {a mathematical formula}F Θ ; we formally define {a mathematical formula}F Θ ′ =defG Ξ ( Θ ) ′ .</a>
