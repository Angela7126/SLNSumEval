<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula} It is immediate to check that everything discussed above with respect to the original set of AICs also applies to its normalized counterpart, i.e., intuitively, these constraints represent the same knowledge and the sets of repairs and weak repairs remain unchanged.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The two intended repairs are thus {a mathematical formula}{+a,+c} and {a mathematical formula}{+b}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let us investigate what the different AFT-style semantics give in this case.Consider{a mathematical formula}Here, it holds that{a mathematical formula} Hence, {a mathematical formula}T Η (U0)=U0 and {a mathematical formula}U0 is the {a mathematical formula}T Η -Kripke – Kleene fixpoint.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We now show that all AFT-style semantics are nicely invariant under shifting.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}T Η , and hence also{a mathematical formula}T Η , commutes with shifting, i.e., for each set{a mathematical formula}S ⊆ At:{a mathematical formula}The clue to proving this proposition is the fact that for each action Α ,{a mathematical formula} Then, the result easily follows from the fact that {a mathematical formula}T Η has been defined entirely based on the {a mathematical formula}supp function.</a>
