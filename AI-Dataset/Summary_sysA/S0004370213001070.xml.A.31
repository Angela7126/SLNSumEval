<a href="#0" id="0">A limid can be interpreted as a concise description of the set of Bayesian networks that represent the joint distributions {a mathematical formula}P(S,A| Δ ) induced by strategies Δ . Additionally, as noted by Cooper [25], the expected utility of any strategy Δ in a limid with a single value variable V can be reduced to the computation of the marginal probability {a mathematical formula}P(V ′ =1) in the Bayesian network that represents {a mathematical formula}P(V ′ ,S,A| Δ )=P(V ′ |Pa(V))P(S,A| Δ ), where {a mathematical formula}V ′ is a binary state variable with the same parent set of V, and {a mathematical formula}P(V ′ =1|Pa(V)) ∝ V(Pa(V)).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">De Campos and Ji ʼ s reduction makes use of these two facts to reduce the computation of the maximum expected utility in limids with single value nodes into a marginal inference in a credal network.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To show that the optimal strategy selection problem is NP-hard, we shall design a family of polytree-shaped limids over binary variables such that for each instance {a mathematical formula}z1, … ,zn of the partition problem there is a limid in the family whose size is polynomial in b (the size of the partition problem) and satisfies {a mathematical formula}max Δ E[U| Δ ] ⩾ 0 if and only if {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1nzi Δ i/z=1 for some solution Δ .</a>
