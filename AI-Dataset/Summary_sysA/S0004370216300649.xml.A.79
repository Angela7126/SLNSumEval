<a href="#0" id="0">In order to analyze the community structure of the SAT instances obtained with our model, we have generated some sets of random formulas for different values of {a mathematical formula}Q ∈ {0.9,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.3} (hence {a mathematical formula}p=Q+1/c), and for different values of number of communities {a mathematical formula}c ∈ {10,20,40,80}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Notice that the main goal of this experiment is to show that our model generates instances with modularity {a mathematical formula}Q ′ and number of communities {a mathematical formula}c ′ similar to the input parameters Q and c, for any number of variables n and clauses m. We use the algorithm described in [9] to compute an approximation of {a mathematical formula}Q ′ and {a mathematical formula}c ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hereinafter we use in our experiments a fixed value of number of communities {a mathematical formula}c=40, assuming that this value is representative for real application problems, and therefore without altering general conclusions observed in the empirical results.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this section we check if this phenomenon also exists in the random SAT instances generated with our model, and if the new transition point, noted {a mathematical formula}r ′ , differs from the classical {a mathematical formula}r ′ ≠ r.</a>
