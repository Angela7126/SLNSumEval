<a href="#0" id="0">Consider dialogue Δ :{a mathematical formula} Here, there is no connection between contents of utterances and their targets, e.g., there is no connection between the rule {a mathematical formula}p ← q and the sentence s, and between the assumption a and the sentence s. The dialogue is not a-successful (and thus not g- and i-successful) as indeed s is not even supported by an argument in {a mathematical formula}F Δ .</a>
