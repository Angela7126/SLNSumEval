<a href="#0" id="0">By using an LP-approach to find independent intervals for schedules in {a mathematical formula}S ′ , we obtain the flexibility of the original system S. We show that in case of STNs this flexibility metric can be computed in polynomial time and offers the possibility to adapt existing schedules in {a mathematical formula}O(1) time.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First of all, we observe that this metric is defined as the sum of intervals, each interval {a mathematical formula}[at,bt] indicating the flexibility of a single event t. Here, flexibility means freedom to choose a real starting time for the event.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based upon these considerations, we propose the following rationality postulates underlying a naive flexibility metric such as {a mathematical formula}flexN for an STN {a mathematical formula}S=(T,C).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To solve the first problem (computing an interval schedule) we use a transformation from a given STN to another STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ and we show that any schedule obtained for the latter can be used to obtain an interval schedule for the former.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To solve the second problem, we use a Linear Programming approach, realizing that an STN such as {a mathematical formula}S ′ can be represented as a set of linear equations and the objective function is a linear function maximizing the size of the intervals of an interval schedule for the original STN S.</a>
