<a href="#0" id="0">LS approaches require only the ability to evaluate the cost and constraint functions, and they always manipulate fully-instantiated solutions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For these reasons, embedding a Machine Learning model requires simply to implement a function evaluator.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a downside, LS approaches are limited in their ability to exploit the model structure for boosting the search process.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If the same values happen to be favorable in terms of cost in the problem model, then such input configurations, despite being uncommon in the training set, will be actively sought by the optimizer and will be much more likely to appear at search time.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Because of this, the actual error in the final system has a chance to be similar to the maximum error on the test set.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">Linear regression makes it feasible to obtain values for all the parameters; however, it also requires one to build a training set, and therefore an overall design effort much closer to that of extracting an Artificial Neural Network.</a>
