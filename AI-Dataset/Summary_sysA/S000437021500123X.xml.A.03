<a href="#0" id="0">The default layer also contains knowledge of action effects on the instance state.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The second type of diagnostic knowledge is a new set of assumptive actions that can hypothesize new pieces of default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula} Π 0 is a solution to the original planning task Π ; that is, a plan that reaches g from the initial state {a mathematical formula}s0.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The planner is allowed to make all the assumptions {a mathematical formula}Aa of the original plan, but the only physical actions that are allowed are the executed actions of the original plan.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, the planning problem has a solution only if the planner can find a sequence of assumptions that allow all the original physical actions to be executed in sequence, and which results in expected and actual observations {a mathematical formula}si matching.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the diagnostic layer there are corresponding default assumptions that can hypothesize new default knowledge about state.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, default assumptions allow the robot to generate more general explanations than are possible with instance assumptions alone.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The diagnostic actions and default assumptive actions are employed only for planning of explanations.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It also shows the use of instance assumptions from instance knowledge to plan under uncertainty.</a>
