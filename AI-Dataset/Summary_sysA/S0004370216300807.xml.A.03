<a href="#0" id="0">Map 1 contains more nodes (e.g., M. Scorsese) and edges (e.g., the edge {a mathematical formula}e1) than Map 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The edge {a mathematical formula}e1 in Map 1 is not present in Map 2; note that the only path between J. Ford and W. Allen in the region is J. Ford → E.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The idea of a map is essentially that of representing reachability information between pairs of distinguished nodes, in a concise way, that is, nodes in the set {a mathematical formula}VM ⊆ V Γ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The array {a mathematical formula}VM contains the set of distinguished nodes, that is, nodes around which the map is built.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let{a mathematical formula} Γ =(V Γ ,E Γ )be a Web Region and{a mathematical formula}M( Γ )the set of all good maps over Γ .</a>
