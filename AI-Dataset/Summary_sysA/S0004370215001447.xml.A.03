<a href="#0" id="0">Taking these considerations into account, the Fifth ASP Competition was based on the System track of the 2013 edition,{sup:2} reusing the available benchmarks but also adding novel problem encodings.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, the 2013 edition still made exceptions and admitted problem encodings in legacy formats, while the Fifth ASP Competition insisted on ASP-Core-2 compliance.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, half of the systems were in 2013 run on “ equivalent ” encoding reformulations in legacy formats, and the Fifth ASP Competition is the first edition relying on common inputs in ASP-Core-2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As described in Section 3, the benchmarks in the Fifth ASP Competition are categorized into tracks based on the language features utilized by encodings.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The second column of Table 1 summarizes the usage of particular language features, among the ones introduced in Section 2, for the encodings from the Fourth ASP Competition in 2013.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We start by presenting performance results for the systems introduced in Section 5 on benchmarks consisting of 2013 problem encodings and twenty randomly selected instances per domain.</a>
