<a href="#0" id="0">Our main task is to turn transition model learning into the learning of conditional distributions {a mathematical formula}P(E|s,f(s),a) using multinomial logistic regression for which attention to relevant features can be efficiently implemented online via mDAGL.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An intelligent, autonomous, and interactive agent or robot should learn to solve different tasks in different environments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An intelligent agent should focus attention on the most relevant task and environmental features for problem solving.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An intelligent agent should also retain or store the knowledge learned in previous tasks, and “ understands ” if, how, and when the learned knowledge can be effectively used in new situations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Toward these objectives, we have presented a framework for learning and transferring multiple expectations or views about world dynamics in heterogeneous environments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Unlike most existing efforts, the proposed framework is scalable as it does not assume fixed actions to be taken or constant environmental features, nor does it require accurate mapping functions to be defined across different tasks or environments.</a>
