<a href="#0" id="0">Consequently, the last derivation step must be an application of (Cut), i.e., there must be a concept {a mathematical formula}E ≠ C such that {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊨ C ⊑ E and {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊨ E ⊑ B.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a regular tree grammar {a mathematical formula}G=(S,N,F,R), the derivation relation {a mathematical formula} → G associated to G is a relation on terms from {a mathematical formula}T(F ∪ N) such that {a mathematical formula}s → Gt if and only if there is a rule {a mathematical formula}N → Α ∈ R and there is a context C such that {a mathematical formula}s=C[N/X] and {a mathematical formula}t=C[ Α /X], where X is a variable from {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Theorem 3 ensures that the subsumees and subsumers used within Definition 8 are all entailed by {a mathematical formula}T. Theorem 3 and Definition 8 imply that {a mathematical formula}T Σ does not contain any concept and role symbols not from Σ .For the second direction, assume that there exists a uniform {a mathematical formula}EL Σ -interpolant of {a mathematical formula}Tnf and, subsequently, {a mathematical formula}T. Then, by Lemma 4, there exists a uniform {a mathematical formula}EL Σ -interpolant {a mathematical formula}T ′ of {a mathematical formula}Tnf and {a mathematical formula}T with {a mathematical formula}d(T ′ ) ≤ N.</a>
