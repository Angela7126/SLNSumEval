<a href="#1" id="1">The integration of planning and acting functions is a critical issues in the design of a deliberation system.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One may characterize ideas and approaches for specifying deliberation models for planning and acting into the following categories:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also discussed a comprehensive stream-based approach for integrating an observing system with planning, acting and monitoring.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Numerous deliberation systems were discussed in Sections 3 Planning, 4 Acting, 5 Monitoring and goal reasoning, 6 Observing, 7 Acquiring deliberation models, along their planning, acting, monitoring, observing and learning functions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Probabilistic and other nondeterministic planners have, for the moment, a narrower use, mostly at the sensory-motor level, e.g., within reinforcement learning approaches.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Their integration in deliberation system will certainly be developed, in particular at the acting level.</a>
