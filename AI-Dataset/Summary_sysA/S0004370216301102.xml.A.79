<a href="#0" id="0">It can be seen that stable semantics yields two extensions {a mathematical formula}{a,d} and {a mathematical formula}{b,c} for {a mathematical formula}F2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since c and d do not occur together in an extension there is an implicit conflict and thus {a mathematical formula}F2 is not analytic (for stable semantics).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the naive extensions of {a mathematical formula}F2 are given by {a mathematical formula}{a,d}, {a mathematical formula}{b,c}, {a mathematical formula}{c,d}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus c and d are not in an implicit conflict here, and the af is easily seen to be analytic for naive semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">in order to fulfill revision postulates) to have exactly the extension-set {a mathematical formula}S from above under stable semantics while consisting solely of the arguments {a mathematical formula}{a,b,c,a ′ ,b ′ ,c ′ }.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Later, for semantics Σ , we will also need upper bounds for the problem {a mathematical formula}Cred Σ 2 defined as follows: given afF and arguments a and b, does there exist an extension {a mathematical formula}S ∈ Σ (F) such that {a mathematical formula}{a,b} ⊆ S (see e.g.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This immediately means that for stage semantics there is an implicit conflict between {a mathematical formula}x¯ and {a mathematical formula}FC (argument a to be precise).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This also means that for semi-stable semantics there are no implicit conflicts between {a mathematical formula}x¯ and any argument from {a mathematical formula}FC.It remains to show that F indeed is analytic for semi-stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">(4) For the last part of the theorem recall that the exact translation for {a mathematical formula}sem → prf from [25] does not add any implicit conflicts between arguments from the original af.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This construction is justified by the fact that for any simple graph G, {a mathematical formula}|MIS(G)|=|nai(dir(G))| and furthermore, as shown in [14, Propositions 4 and 5] naive and stable semantics coincide on the class of irreflexive and symmetric afs.</a>
