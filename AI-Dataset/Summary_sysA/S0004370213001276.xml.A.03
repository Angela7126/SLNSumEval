<a href="#0" id="0">However, the previous method based on a single taxonomy could not resolve the problem of the sparsity of items and that of SAs simultaneously, while still maintaining the semantic relationships expressed by the linked information of a tag assigned to an item by a user.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our method groups the SAs assigned by users to items in SCs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is the first study to use taxonomies of items and SAs to address the sparsity problem while maintaining the semantic relationships expressed by linked information for tags assigned by users to items.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our method can measure the similarity of users based on items or SAs assigned to items by users, as well as using the item classes, which include the item and the that SCs contain the SAs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, Linked Taxonomies measures the similarity of user interests based on the SAs and the SCs assigned to transacted items.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, this dataset contained sparse SAs assigned to items compared with the user ratings of items.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This method computes the user similarity based on the ratings assigned by users to items and classes in a single taxonomy of items.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, they simply reflect the user ratings of items in their classes and they do not utilize the SAs users give to items.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Linked Taxonomies improved the recommendation accuracy by measuring the similarity of users using the SAs/SCs assigned to items and those given to item classes.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Furthermore, the movie dataset was sparser than the restaurant dataset, i.e., compare “ the average number of ratings assigned to items by users ” to “ the average number of ratings with SAs assigned to items by users ” in Table 1, Table 3.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Our method groups the SAs assigned by users to items into SCs, and the SAs/SCs assigned to an item reflect the classes in which they are included.</a>
