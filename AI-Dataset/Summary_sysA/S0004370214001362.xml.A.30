<a href="#0" id="0">We then define and present our approach to learning pseudo-tags from content, which guarantees a tag-based representation for every track in a collection.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Next, we present our novel hybrid representation, which is a dynamic combination of both pseudo-tags and tags.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To evaluate our approach, we then examine both the recommendation quality, and the quality of pseudo-tagging.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, we present our results and conclusions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Using this method of combining pseudo-tags with tags, we are now able to represent every track by a hybrid vector h. For tracks which are well-tagged, the tag vector will be the main contributor to h, and therefore allow recommendation to be made using the strengths of tag representation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For weakly-tagged tracks, any tags which they have will not be ignored, but instead enhanced by the inclusion of pseudo-tags in h. Recommendations are made using this hybrid representation based on cosine similarity, and will be referred to as Hybrid.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The reason that Hybrid is able to achieve this higher quality is because of the pseudo-tags that are embedded into the representation.</a>
