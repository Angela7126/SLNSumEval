<a href="#1" id="1">This section studies the regret bounds when the covariance matrices are approximated.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Recall that the covariance matrices are given by{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Xt+ and {a mathematical formula}Xt − denote the matrices of positive and negative instances, respectively.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the following, we will derive the online-to-batch bounds for OPAUC algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, we say that an online learning algorithm has a regret bound {a mathematical formula}RT if {a mathematical formula}wT0,wT0+1, … ,wT − 1 are such that{a mathematical formula} From Theorem 2, we can observe {a mathematical formula}RT=O(1/T) for the OPAUC algorithm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This definition is helpful to derive the online-to-batch bounds from generalization bounds, and it has been used in [30].</a>
