<a href="#1" id="1">Given an LIG and a number{a mathematical formula}k ≥ 1, it is NP-complete to decide if there exists a PSNE with at least k players playing the action 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Yet, out of purely scientific curiosity and suggestions/feedback about our work, we present preliminary results based on a heuristic for the problem of most influential nodes in our context (i.e., LIGs) that we designed by adapting what is arguably the most popular and simple greedy-selection algorithm for identifying “ most influential ” nodes developed specifically for the cascade model of diffusion [49].</a>
