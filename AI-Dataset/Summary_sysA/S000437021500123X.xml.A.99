<a href="#0" id="0">Decision-theoretic planning, by contrast, produces a policy maximizing the probability of success{sup:9} from any belief state the robot might reach during plan execution, taking account of the probabilities of every possible action outcome in those states.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Decision-theoretic planning thus handles multiple action outcomes (Markov decision processes, MDPs) and unreliable observations (POMDPs), but at an unfeasible computational cost given the size of typical robot domains.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Recall that assumptions may occur only before the first physical action.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, the planning problem has a solution only if the planner can find a sequence of assumptions that allow all the original physical actions to be executed in sequence, and which results in expected and actual observations {a mathematical formula}si matching.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the second case, by our allowing instance assumptions based on default knowledge, explanations posit the existence of new places or objects â€” such as the existence of a new room the object might be in.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, by using assumptions for explanations, we can also leverage the mix of relational and commonsense knowledge employed for regular task planning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To test the explanation performance of our system, we analyzed the generated explanations for three perception failure runs of the find test condition outlined before and an additional seven runs under a specifically designed explain test condition, where the object was hidden on a shelf in the meeting room.</a>
