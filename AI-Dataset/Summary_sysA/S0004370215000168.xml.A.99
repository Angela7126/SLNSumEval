<a href="#0" id="0">Formally, its update scheme is historical performance weighted average of all possible constant rebalanced portfolios in the entire simplex domain,{a mathematical formula} In detail, UP's initial portfolio {a mathematical formula}b1 is uniform over the market, and its {a mathematical formula}t+1st portfolio is historical performance weighted average of all CRP experts with {a mathematical formula}b ∈ Δ m.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The main idea of PAMR is to design a loss function of {a mathematical formula} ℓ Ε (b;xt) in order to reflect the mean reversion property, that is, if the expected return based on last price relative is larger than a pre-defined threshold, the loss will linearly increase; otherwise, the loss is zero.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The basic idea is to maximize the expected return {a mathematical formula}b ⋅ x ˜ t+1, and keep last portfolio information via a regularization term, using the online passive – aggressive learning method [17].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, we follow the similar idea of PAMR [46] and formulate an optimization as,</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, we propose to adopt the Buy and Hold (BAH) combination strategy [8], [27], [46], that is, for each period, we treat an individual OLMAR model with a specified parameter {a mathematical formula}w ≥ 3 as an expert and combine multiple experts' portfolios weighted by their historical trading performance.</a>
