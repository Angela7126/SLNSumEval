<a href="#0" id="0">While the results apply in general, they are strongest when {a mathematical formula}m ∈ poly(n) (e.g., for matching or when all coalitions that can form have constant size), since in this case we obtain a clear dichotomy of polynomial in n vs. exponential in n. Moreover, if {a mathematical formula}m ∈ poly(n), then many involved problems in constructing improvement steps (finding a local blocking coalition, or the one with maximum benefit) can be solved trivially in time {a mathematical formula}poly(n).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A coalition C is only accessible if all pairs of agents in C are connected by permanent (through L) or temporary links (currently in the same coalition).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, if C is a local blocking coalition and gets added, this does not introduce any new temporary links.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">On the other hand, some temporary links might get deleted if coalitions overlapping with C are deleted.Now assume C is a local blocking coalition of maximal benefit among all local blocking coalitions in {a mathematical formula}S. Then, once C is formed, it will not be deleted by any other coalition created through blocking dynamics as no new coalitions of higher value can become accessible.</a>
