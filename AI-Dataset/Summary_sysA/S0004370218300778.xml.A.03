<a href="#0" id="0">A credibility base is a finite set {a mathematical formula}C of credibility objects.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that even though an argument {a mathematical formula}X can have one or more credibility objects, each argument has only one conclusion.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider again the credibility base of our running example introduced in Example 2:{a mathematical formula} There are seven arguments that can be built from {a mathematical formula}C2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Nevertheless, in the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C2 there is more information that can be used.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider again the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C2 and Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C5 from Example 5.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consider for instance the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C7 from Example 7.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The associated AFRA {a mathematical formula}(ArgsC7,AttsC7) of that credibility base is depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C7 and its associated AFRA as depicted in Fig.</a>
