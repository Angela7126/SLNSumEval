<a href="#0" id="0">Strictly, this is not a big switch approach, but shows that the system would not work for a similar problem with different relations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As an indirect result and based on the previous relations, they produced “ a pair (FAIRAVEN and BETTERAVEN) of computer simulation models that performed like the median or best college students in the sample ” , which were based on the analysis of eye fixations, verbal protocols, error patterns, and the identification of the previous rules.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As the reasons to choose RPM, Carpenter et al.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Unlike the previous work [121], the motivation of this work is to solve the problems in a cognitive way, i.e., explaining why the system fails (ambiguousness, objects neglected, incorrect rules applied, … ) and why some problems are more difficult than others (number and type of rules applied, number of calls to the declarative memory, objects stored, … ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Considering the results obtained, the authors claim that the visual complexity involved in solving this kind of problems is smaller than the functional difficulty (rules to be applied).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As a computational formalisation of all this can be difficult, only the integration of all these approaches from psychometrics, artificial intelligence, and other areas may lead to a full understanding of what intelligence is.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The creation of systems capable of doing this is more related to the areas of learning by demonstration and inductive programming [142], [143], as mentioned above, rather than other areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning.</a>
