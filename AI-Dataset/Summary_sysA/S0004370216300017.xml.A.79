<a href="#0" id="0">By induction on the length of {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ Δ M, we define a function {a mathematical formula}h: Δ M → Δ I which satisfies the following properties implying that h is a {a mathematical formula}( Σ , Γ )-homomorphism:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} (Note that (2) refers to the full {a mathematical formula}T-types comprising concepts of the form ⊤ , A and {a mathematical formula} ∃ R.B rather than the atomic Σ -types t containing only concept names.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the remainder of this section, we show that condition {a mathematical formula}(win) in the infinite game {a mathematical formula}G Σ (G2,M1) can be checked by analysing a much more complex game on the finite generating structures {a mathematical formula}G2 and {a mathematical formula}G1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using the map h, one can now construct the required starting states satisfying (6), and Ω -winning strategies in {a mathematical formula}G Σ g(G2,G1X) in exactly the same way as in the proof of {a mathematical formula}(a) ⇒ (b) in Lemma 30.</a>
