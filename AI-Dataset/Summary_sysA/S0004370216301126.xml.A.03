<a href="#0" id="0">A state of the system is a pair {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) of an allocation A and a payment balance Π .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we are using the Knaster payment scheme, any state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) reached during negotiation will satisfy {a mathematical formula} Π (i)=exi(A) − Ex(A)/n for each agent i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that i does not envy j in state {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Suppose again there are three agents on a line, the payment balance is currently 0 for all agents, and the valuation function of agent 3 is {a mathematical formula}v3(S)=0 for any {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ G.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then agents 1 and 2 can go through all {a mathematical formula}2m allocations that divide all goods between the two of them and end up in the allocation where agent 2 owns all items (that is, there are {a mathematical formula}2m − 1 IR deals between them).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">How much does agent i envy agent j in state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π )?</a>
