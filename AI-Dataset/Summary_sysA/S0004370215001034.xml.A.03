<a href="#0" id="0">This suggests that we can identify geometric betweenness in {a mathematical formula}S with conceptual betweenness.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We also found some triples {a mathematical formula}(a,b,c) in which one of the place types is a generalization of the other(s).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is moreover natural to assume that such directions will correspond to terms that occur in the text corpus from which the space {a mathematical formula}S was induced.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The baseline measure {a mathematical formula}diffB tends to select terms which are too specific (e.g.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While {a mathematical formula}diffA is able to identify reasonable terms when the two wines are very different (e.g.</a>
