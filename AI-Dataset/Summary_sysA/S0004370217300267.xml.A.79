<a href="#0" id="0">This shows how off-the-shelf technologies can produce a pipeline system, running from natural language dialogue about the construction of a mathematical proof, to philosophical theory, to the formal expression of natural language reasoning in dialogue games, and from there to abstract argumentation and argumentation semantics, and finally, coming full circle, to show that implementations of these systems can then provide value back to the mathematical community from which the philosophical theory was derived.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These argument structures should be submittable to a simple, algorithmic procedure which will yield precisely the theory that represents the current shared understanding at any point in the game.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}ODefinition allows Opponent to offer an alternative definition, which requires update to the AIF structure not only to include the new definition, e, but also (i) the conflict with Proponent's definition and (ii) the inference from e to Opponent's reason, s, for thinking the counterexample holds.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The approach described in this section shows how as a Lakatos Game is executed, AIF structures are created which, when translated to {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+, produce abstract argumentation frameworks which under grounded semantics have as acceptable arguments all and only those elements which correspond to the mathematical theory accepted by the participants at a given stage of the game.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Second, by virtue of the relationship between {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ and abstract argumentation, we show updates to an abstract framework for the Lakatos Game LG, {a mathematical formula}AFLG= 〈 ARLG,attacksLG 〉 , comprising a set of abstract arguments {a mathematical formula}ARLG and a relation of attacks {a mathematical formula}attacksLG over them following Dung [32].</a>
