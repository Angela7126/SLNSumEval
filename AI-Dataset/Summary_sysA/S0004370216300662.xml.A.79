<a href="#0" id="0">As it turns out, repair answer sets do not have higher complexity than ordinary answer sets (more precisely, weak and flp answer sets) if queries in DL-atoms are evaluable in polynomial time; to ensure this, we concentrate on the prominent Description Logic DL-{a mathematical formula}LiteA from the DL-Lite family [21].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that {a mathematical formula}PweakI,O is an ordinary ground positive program without DL-atoms and default-negated literals, which has the least (unique minimal) model if each rule in {a mathematical formula}P is definite (i.e., {a mathematical formula}n=1 in (1)).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is not difficult to verify that I is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}PflpI,O, and hence an flp-answer set of Π ; in fact {a mathematical formula}ASflp( Π )={I}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">(Hardness) The {a mathematical formula}NP-hardness is inherited from ordinary normal logic programs, whose repair answer sets coincide with their answer sets; as deciding answer set existence for normal logic programs is {a mathematical formula}NP-hard [61], the result follows.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">(Completeness of RepAns) Let {a mathematical formula}rep( Σ ,x)I ˆ | Π ( Π ) be the set of all Σ -selected repairs for Π that turn {a mathematical formula}I ˆ | Π into an x-repair answer set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Towards a contradiction, assume that there exists some {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ rep( Σ ,x)I ˆ | Π ( Π ) which is not an output of the algorithm RepAns.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus one of the following must be true: (i) no extension of {a mathematical formula}I| Π with guessed values of replacement atoms is a model of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ ″ , (ii) no model of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ ″ is a compatible set for {a mathematical formula} Π ″ or (iii) there exists {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊂ I| Π , which is a model of {a mathematical formula}PweakI| Π ,O ″ .The case (i) is irrelevant, as {a mathematical formula}I| Π ˆ satisfies all rules of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ due to {a mathematical formula}I ∈ AS( Π ˆ ∪ Π supp ∪ facts(A)) and {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ ″ = Π ˆ .</a>
