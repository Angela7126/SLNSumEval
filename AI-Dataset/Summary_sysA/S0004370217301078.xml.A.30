<a href="#0" id="0">Argument (2) is rather weak: although the expected utility is always positive, the proposed action may have a lower expected utility than the alternative for some (or even all) values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j1).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Expected Utility Premise: {a mathematical formula}euag( Α ,prob(j0)) returns the expected utilities of agent ag performing Α for values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j0) where {a mathematical formula}j0 is the desired joint action.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The first premise identifies the values that the agent will consider and the second weights them in terms of the most important value.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The joint actions containing the advocated action Α as the action of ag are then taken from the AATS+V to give the third premise.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The fourth premise then establishes the expected utilities for the various probabilities of the desired joint action, {a mathematical formula}j0, resulting from ag performing Α .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Dominance Premise: {a mathematical formula}euag( Α ,j0) ≥ euag( Β ,j0) for any alternative action Β available to ag, for all values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j0); where {a mathematical formula}j0 is the joint action compliant with the action of ag.</a>
