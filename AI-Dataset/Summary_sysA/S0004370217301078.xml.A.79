<a href="#0" id="0">The real advance here over previous work such as [19] is that there is no longer any need to make assumptions about what the other believes and prefers: the agent can now come to a decision using its own relative preferences between values, its own beliefs and the degree of risk it is prepared to take, whilst requiring no additional machinery: it uses only the AATS+V [19] based on its own beliefs, causal model and values [45].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Now, unlike previous work such as [19], there is no longer any need for the reasoning agent to make assumptions about the others' beliefs, domain conceptualisation and preferences that this other agent would use to choose a particular action: the reasoning agent will then be able to decide using its own relative preferences between values, its own beliefs and, where necessary, the particular degree of risk it is subjectively prepared to accept.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the utilities of these payoffs are subjective with respect to the individual goals and aspirations of the agent concerned, and so can be individually set and made subject to change, possibly as a result of persuasive argument, or of empirical evidence.</a>
