<a href="#0" id="0">Most NERC taggers are supervised statistical systems that extract patterns and term features which are considered to be indications of Named Entity (NE) types using the manually annotated training data (extracting orthographic, linguistic and other types of evidence) and often external knowledge resources.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As in other NLP tasks, supervised statistical NERC systems are more robust and obtain better performance on available evaluation sets, although sometimes the statistical models can also be combined with specific rules for some NE types.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Contrary to previous suggestions that the larger the number of classes and the corpus used to induced the clusters the better [60], our results provide a number of interesting pointers to choose the appropriate type of corpus and clustering method required for optimal performance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, the named entity ‘ Uzbekistan ’ is not present in the English CoNLL 2003 training data, whereas in the test set can be found four times, all of them locations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The local model annotates all four occurrences as organization (see Table 5 for references to models).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The Brown and the Word2vec models, two as locations and two as organizations, because the cluster companions of ‘ Uzbekistan ’ are of mixed nature.</a>
