<a href="#0" id="0">We have detailed how task-based relationships are represented with the compatibility function Φ , which uses the distance between agent vertices in a graph, and how agent capabilities are represented as Normally-distributed variables.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this section, we formally define the weighted synergy graph and how it is used to compute the performance of a team of agents at a task.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While the synergy function {a mathematical formula}S is linear and takes the average of pairwise synergy, many interesting agent relationships are modeled.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">4 shows an example of a weighted synergy graph with five agents in a rescue task.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Using the weighted synergy graph model and the synergy equations, we can compute the synergy of a team of agents {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ A.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, the synergy computed is a Normally-distributed variable, and we need to rank such variables to choose one possible team over another.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We have formally defined the weighted synergy graph and our team formation algorithm to approximate the Δ -optimal team.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, the team formation algorithm assumes the existence of a weighted synergy graph.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this section, we contribute our learning algorithm that learns a weighted synergy graph using only observations of the performance of teams of agents in {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Algorithm 3 shows the pseudo-code of our learning algorithm.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The algorithm first generates a random weighted graph structure with {a mathematical formula}N=|A| vertices, and the function LearnCapabilities estimates the capabilities of the agents using the weighted graph structure and observation set O.</a>
