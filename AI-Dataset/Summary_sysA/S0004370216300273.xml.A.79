<a href="#0" id="0">Otherwise, we reach a consistent state, in which no further inference from module {a mathematical formula}S1 is applicable (that state represents a model of {a mathematical formula}S1).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proof that X is also a model of {a mathematical formula}BC( Π ) uses the well-known fact that if X is an answer set of Π , X is also a supported model of Π that is, for every {a mathematical formula}a ∈ X, there is {a mathematical formula}B ∈ Bodies( Π ) such that X is a model of {a mathematical formula}s(B).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let us consider an inference {a mathematical formula}(M,l) ∈ BC( Π ) such that M is consistent with X.</a>
