<a href="#1" id="1">We first prove the upper bound.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider an optimal assignment x with {a mathematical formula}xij ∈ {0, Μ i} for every buyer type/vendor pair and the price vector p with {a mathematical formula}pj=cj; clearly, x is consistent to p. By deviating to any other price, vendor j cannot get any buyers that are not assigned to it in the optimal assignment; it can, however, increase its utility by raising the price for those buyers that are already assigned to it.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Example 3</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider the price competition game in the proof of Lemma 4; we repeat it in Table 4.Consider the allocation x where all buyers of type ℓ are assigned to vendor ℓ and all buyers of type r are assigned to vendor r. By applying algorithm CandidatePrice, we obtain the price vector {a mathematical formula}p=(5,5) and the corresponding subsidy vector {a mathematical formula}s(x,p)=(1,1); this amount of subsidies is required so that no vendor has incentive to lower the price to {a mathematical formula}3 − Ε and obtain all buyers and a utility of {a mathematical formula}6 − 2 Ε .</a>
