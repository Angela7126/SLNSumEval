<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, using the classical consequence operation Cn, an inconsistent {a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ K would imply {a mathematical formula}Cn( Γ )=L, and any consistent knowledge base could be the ⋆ -consolidation of Γ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the first case, {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ is the identity function, and ⋆ -innocuous formulas are equal to free formulas, due to the characterisation given by Proposition 4.2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider a knowledge base{a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ Kand a modular{a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ :K → K.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A formula{a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Γ is ⋆ -innocuous in Γ iff it is in no ⋆ -conflict of Γ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The result above shows that, given a modular consequence operation {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ , the formulas in a knowledge base Γ can be split into two groups: the formulas involved in some ⋆ -conflict; and the ⋆ -innocuous formulas, which are consistent with any ⋆ -consolidation {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ ∈ Cn ⋆ ( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In other words, the version of dominance satisfied by {a mathematical formula}IMIS is based on a very weak modular consequence operation: for a consistent Φ , {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ ({ Φ }) contains only tautologies besides formulas equivalent to Φ .</a>
