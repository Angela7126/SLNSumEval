<a href="#1" id="1">For each case {a mathematical formula}c ∈ NCB, if it is in one identified concept drift competence area corresponding to {a mathematical formula}p1, that is, there is a certain {a mathematical formula}r ∈ ℜ p1 so that {a mathematical formula}c ∈ r, then this case must be in one identified concept drift competence area corresponding to {a mathematical formula}p2 as well, since {a mathematical formula}r ∈ ℜ p2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, any case of the later window will be excluded from this list when there is concept drift if it lies in the identified competence area.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A major difference between SRR and other deletion-based competence preservation methods is that SRR recursively removes redundant cases in a competently uniform way, which we believe is more suitable for the concept drift problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, cases in the remaining case-base that can solve case A as well as cases {a mathematical formula}c1,c2 are retrieved.</a>
