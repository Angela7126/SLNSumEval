<a href="#0" id="0">Given an explicit account of the observations made by each agent, the required semantics of the K relation are clear: {a mathematical formula}K(agt,s ′ ,s) must hold whenever {a mathematical formula}s ′ is legal, both s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ would result in the same view for the agent, and s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ are rooted at K-related initial situations:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These axioms suffice to ensure that knowledge behaves as we require: two situations will be related by {a mathematical formula}K(agt,s ′ ,s) if and only if they result in identical views for that agent, {a mathematical formula}s ′ is legal, and their root situations were initially related:</a>
