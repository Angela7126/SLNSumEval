<a href="#0" id="0">For example, although there is no difference in theoretical complexity in the general case, optimal planning is harder than satisficing sequential planning in practice [22], [28].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, planners in both tracks were evaluated over the same collection of domains, but problems for the optimal track were carefully selected to be easier to solve.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Although the number of objects in a planning problem has been widely used as a weak measure of difficulty, there is currently no effective domain-independent procedure for characterizing the difficulty of problems for a given set of planners, other than attempting to solve them and to look at the results, as in the CSP competition.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The organizers of the fifth IPC adopted a different, but similar, methodology: when comparing runtime they assigned twice the time limit to cases for which no solution was generated, observing that this was the minimum value for which the performance gap for a problem solved by one planner and not solved by the other is greater than the performance gap for any problem solved by both.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To prove this, observe that the score for planner p when using the best solution found as a reference for a specific planning task i is{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Î” ip is the excess committed by planner p over the best solution found (and necessarily equal to zero for at least one planner) when solving instance i.</a>
