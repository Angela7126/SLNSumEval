<a href="#0" id="0">To extend the third step of the Gelfond – Lifschitz definition to first-order formulas, we first extend the van Emden – Kowalski operator {a mathematical formula}TP(S), which is applicable only to a positive logic program P parameterized with a set S of ground atoms, to a new operator {a mathematical formula}T Π (O,N) that is applicable to a general logic program Π parameterized with two first-order theories O and N. As shall be seen below, the first parameter O of the extended operator {a mathematical formula}T Π (O,N) is used to express a set of rule heads in {a mathematical formula}ground( Π ), while the second parameter N used to express some constrains.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A model I of a normal logic program Π is an answer set under the standard answer set semantics if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(T Π I( ∅ ))if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − ))if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The conditions listed in Corollary 1 for an answer set of a normal logic program do not apply to a logic program with first-order formulas, because in the latter case the fixpoint {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) (resp.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − ))) would be a first-order theory instead of a set of ground atoms (e.g., see Example 7).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, these conditions suggest that instead of requiring each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I be included in {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )), answer sets of a logic program Π with first-order formulas can be defined by requiring that each{a mathematical formula}A ∈ Iis true in the fixpoint{a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − ))under the constraints{a mathematical formula}¬I − ; i.e., for each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I, {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A.</a>
