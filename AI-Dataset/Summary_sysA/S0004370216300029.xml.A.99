<a href="#0" id="0">We restrict our attention here to formulas of the form{a mathematical formula} which correspond in a natural way to rules of form (1) where for {a mathematical formula}l=0, the formula {a mathematical formula}a1 ∨ ⋯ ∨ al is ⊥ ; every program P corresponds then similarly to a theory (set of formulas) {a mathematical formula} Γ P.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">They show that {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model semantics is with respect to model checking (MCH) and inference (INF) one level higher up in the polynomial hierarchy than the {a mathematical formula}EQ-model (i.e., answer set) semantics; this is not surprising as the characterization of a {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model in Theorem 2 involves besides h-minimality also gap-minimality, while the {a mathematical formula}EQ-model definition involves only h-minimality.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As gap-minimality is a global property and has to be checked across all h-minimal HT-models of a program, intuitively an (additional) quantifier is needed to express that no h-minimal HT-model with smaller gap exists; in particular, this causes {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model checking for normal programs to become intractable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This lemma in turn follows from Proposition 12 in [19], which states this property for partial stable models of constraint-free (even disjunctive) programs, and {a mathematical formula}WF(P) is the least partial stable model; note also that constraints in P merely determine the existence of {a mathematical formula}WF(P) but do not influence the truth valuation of atoms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Formally, one can show:{a mathematical formula} Note that the program P is stratified; it follows that brave reasoning under {a mathematical formula}SEQ-semantics is {a mathematical formula} Σ 3P-hard for disjunctive and stratified disjunctive programs; this proves the respective hardness parts of item (i) in Theorem 11.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For cautious reasoning from disjunctive and stratified disjunctive programs under {a mathematical formula}SEQ-semantics, {a mathematical formula} Π 3P-hardness of item (ii) in Theorem 11 is shown by a slight extension of the reduction, which is carried out in Appendix C.2 to derive this result for fixed truth value v.</a>
