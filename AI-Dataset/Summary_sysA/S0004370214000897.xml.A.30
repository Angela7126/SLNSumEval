<a href="#0" id="0">The WCO mechanism is defined for all multi-unit auctions where each agent has nonincreasing marginal values for units.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From now on, we will simply use allocation vector {a mathematical formula}(a1,a2, … ,an) to refer to the (only) corresponding strategy-proof linear allocation mechanism.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We will only consider strategy-proof linear allocation mechanisms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Under linear allocation mechanism {a mathematical formula}(a1,a2, … ,an), the mechanism's efficiency equals {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1naivi.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Agent i's VCG-based payment equals the following:{a mathematical formula}</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">That is, this mechanism has the highest competitive ratio among all complete mechanisms whose allocation part is linear.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the first mechanism, one agent is excluded and assigned one unit.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In the second mechanism, one agent is excluded and assigned zero units.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">It should be noted that if we omit the last step in Example Mechanism 2, that is, if we do not transfer all the VCG revenue to the excluded agent, then the mechanism becomes exactly the linear allocation mechanism in Example 4.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">That is, it becomes linear allocation mechanism{a mathematical formula} Similarly, if we omit the last step in Example Mechanism 1, then the mechanism becomes linear allocation mechanism{a mathematical formula} (The first {a mathematical formula}m − 1 agents always win, excluded or not.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The m-th agent wins only if she is excluded or one agent from 1 to {a mathematical formula}m − 1 is excluded.</a>
