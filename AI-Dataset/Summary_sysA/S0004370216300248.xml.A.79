<a href="#0" id="0">Second, we specify constraints on frequency, format and negative elements in order to reduce problem complexity, and in particular, to build a framework of NSP mining on set theory to extract negative sequential patterns from identified positive patterns (frequency constraint), reduce the number of NSC (format constraint), and substantially reduce the complexity in handling partially negative elements (negative element constraint).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, in [11], only the positive partner of each element in negative sequences ns is required to be frequent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In our work, we require that the positive partner, not only each element, of ns should be frequent, i.e., {a mathematical formula}sup(p(ns)) ≥ min_sup.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If {a mathematical formula}s Α is a negative sequence, it is required to satisfy Constraint 2, which means that there must not be continuous negative elements in {a mathematical formula}s Α .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">2, we have:{a mathematical formula}This result is consistent with the negative containment definition, by which data sequences containing {a mathematical formula}{<a¬b>} are the same sequences that contain {a mathematical formula}{<a>} but do not contain {a mathematical formula}{<ab>}.Subsequently, we obtain:{a mathematical formula} Similarly,{a mathematical formula}Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Even in the worst situation in which the data is too big to fit completely into the main memory, by using the e-NSP candidate generation method for k-size positive sequential patterns, the size range of negative elements in the corresponding NSC is {a mathematical formula}1 → ⌜ k/2 ⌝ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Now we discuss the generalized representation of Equation (5), because the discussions later are all based on the generalized representation and {a mathematical formula}p(1 − negMSi) in Equation (5) is the support of a very detailed set {a mathematical formula}{p(1 − negMSi)}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We use the average support of {a mathematical formula}{p(1 − negMSi)}, {a mathematical formula}sup ‾ (p(1 − negMSi)), instead of {a mathematical formula}sup(p(1 − negMSi)).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}sup ‾ (p(1 − negMSi)) indicates the degree of sparsity of the items in a database and it meets the need of generalization.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For a {a mathematical formula}k − size and {a mathematical formula}m − neg − size NSC, the size of the PSP of its corresponding {a mathematical formula}p(1 − negMSi) is {a mathematical formula}k − m+1.</a>
