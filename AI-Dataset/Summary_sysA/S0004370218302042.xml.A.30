<a href="#1" id="1">Given a Boolean game G and a formula of propositional logic Φ , determine whether G has an equilibrium where Φ is satisfied with a probability of 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a Boolean game G and a formula of propositional logic Φ , determine whether Φ is satisfied with a probability of 1 in every equilibrium of G.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The reader will note that while the payoff for Player One in any pure profile in a Boolean game need be 1 or 0, there is no such restriction on mixed profiles — after all, the unique mixed equilibrium of Matching Pennies gives either player {a mathematical formula}12.</a>
