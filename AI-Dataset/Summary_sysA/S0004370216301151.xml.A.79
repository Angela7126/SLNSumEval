<a href="#0" id="0">Our model is based on similar assumptions, but it differs in three main aspects: i) utterances given to our learner offer a partial or total description of the scene, but they do not refer to things that are not in the scene; ii) we are not limited to word learning (our learning task is more complex: our system learns to generate and understand relevant utterances in a given scene); iii) we use a richer semantic representation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For each variable atom that the learner has encountered in a unique teacher meaning, there is a decision tree that determines what sequence of words to produce for that atom in the context of the whole meaning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The learner continues to produce unintelligible utterances, utterances with errors in form and meaning, and correct utterances, while refining its co-occurrence graph (allowing it to understand the teacher's utterances more accurately), acquiring new general forms, and improving its rules for word choice.</a>
