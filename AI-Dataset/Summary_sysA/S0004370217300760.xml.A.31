<a href="#0" id="0">After constructing the pseudo tree, all agents assign values sequentially, starting with the root of the tree down to the leaves.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The assignments are performed only by agents holding a CPA, which is a message received from the agent's parent in the pseudo tree.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A CPA contains the Current Partial Assignment of all ancestors of the current agent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition, a CPA message contains an Upper Bound (UB) on the solution cost, and the {a mathematical formula}CPA_Cost, which is the accumulated cost of constraints between all assignments it contains.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When an agent {a mathematical formula}Ai extends the CPA with an assignment to its variable (the variable of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai is denoted {a mathematical formula}Xi), it sends a LB_Request message, containing a copy of the CPA, to all of its descendants in the pseudo tree.</a>
