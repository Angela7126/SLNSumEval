<a href="#1" id="1">An unexpected effect triggers the refinement of the precondition of the executed PO, {a mathematical formula}rexe, to search for those descriptors that are necessary for the changes coded in the PO but that are still missing from the precondition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The POs in {a mathematical formula}Rexe are those generated during the learning process that represent more evidence of producing the coded effect, i.e., those which have a higher probability (see Eq.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is because the POs in {a mathematical formula}Rn only test combinations of descriptors in a limited number of regions of the state space and further refinements will only continue searching in those specific regions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The second refinement involves specializing the precondition of {a mathematical formula}ri using the descriptors of the preconditions of the other POs in {a mathematical formula}Rcomb,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Ri[2] is the set of POs generated from this refinement and {a mathematical formula}pk is the precondition of any other PO {a mathematical formula}rk ∈ Rcomb.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This initial situation is described by the state{a mathematical formula} Given this initial situation and the PO set containing only the PO generated from the teacher instruction (31), the planner generated a plan that comprised this single PO.</a>
