<a href="#0" id="0">These enable us to calculate the expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai when there are j search periods remaining, given the best value v obtained so far by any of the agents and the search strategies of the other agents {a mathematical formula}{pwj(v)|w ≠ i}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The second term is the expected utility from reaching the next search period when the best value known is the maximum between the value found by the agent itself in the current search period, the best value returned by the other agents in the current search period (associated with a distribution {a mathematical formula}f¯ij(x)), and the best value obtained by all the agents in former {a mathematical formula}n − j periods.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider a setting where three self-interested agents search jointly, when the search cost is {a mathematical formula}c=0.2 and the search horizon is {a mathematical formula}n=10.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">4 depicts the individual expected utility of two homogeneous agents {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}A2, associated with an equal search cost {a mathematical formula}c1=c2=0.2, when a third agent with a search cost c (given as the horizontal axis) is added.</a>
