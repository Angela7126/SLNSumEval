<a href="#0" id="0">We propose an optimal Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation of the problem of scheduling EVs in a MoD scheme that maximizes the number of completed tasks (i.e., trip requests from consumers) or the EV utilization (i.e., number of time points each EV is travelling), either using battery swap or battery charging at each station.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, in case where some EVs do not have a large enough battery to execute some of the longest trips, we observe that the greedy algorithm does not provide the optimal solution anymore and that the incremental MIP is the correct choice as it generates solution 0.5% better than the greedy and with lower execution time, while the optimal algorithm is the best but scales up to medium sized problems only.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now, for an EV to execute a task, its full range, calculated based on the battery level at the starting time of the task, must not be violated (Equation (11)) (i.e., in case trip requests are not within the range of a single battery load, the solver will not schedule them).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In more detail, assuming that the MoD company has full knowledge of the demand for only a small number of tasks {a mathematical formula} Δ fix ⊆ Δ , the remainder of (usually longer term) future demand is stochastic in nature and, to some degree, can be captured using a probability distribution learnt from historical data – expected set of tasks, {a mathematical formula} Δ exp.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We next evaluate the execution time by varying the rest of the dimensions (i.e., EVs, time points and locations).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given the execution time of the incremental and the greedy algorithms combined with local search, we argue that for a setting where the EVs carry different battery types, and when the number of tasks is larger than 1000, the incremental-MIP is the appropriate solution.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, in case where some EVs do not have a large enough battery to execute some of the longest trips, we observe that the greedy algorithm does not provide the optimal solution anymore and that the incremental-MIP is the correct choice as it generates solution 0.5% better than the greedy and with lower execution time, while the optimal algorithm is still the best but scales up to medium sized problems only.</a>
