<a href="#0" id="0">HTN planning problemAn HTN planning problem{a mathematical formula}P is a tuple {a mathematical formula}(Q,O,M,tn0,s0), where</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Sometimes we refer to the HTN planning that uses this style as totally ordered HTN planning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">HTN planners allow tasks with variables to be inserted into a task network.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given an HTN planning problem {a mathematical formula}P, at the beginning of the search, a task decomposition is imposed on the initial task network {a mathematical formula}tn0, and the process continues by repeatedly decomposing tasks from a newly created task network until a primitive task network is produced.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We refer to HTN planners that search in this plan space as plan-based HTN planners, and to the model of HTN planning as plan-based HTN planning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We refer to HTN planners searching in this space as state-based HTN planners, and to the model of HTN planning as state-based HTN planning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">SolutionLet {a mathematical formula}P be an HTN planning problem.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A task network tn in state-based HTN planning is less expressive than the one in plan-based HTN planning.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">SolutionLet {a mathematical formula}P be an HTN planning problem.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Given an HTN planning problem {a mathematical formula}P, we define each as follows.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula}P be an HTN planning problem.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let {a mathematical formula}P be an HTN planning problem.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let {a mathematical formula}P be an HTN planning problem.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Planner takes in the current HTN planning problem {a mathematical formula}P and computes a solution plan Î  .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">To that end, let {a mathematical formula}P be an HTN planning problem.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">HTN planning is particularly suitable for cooperative distributed planning, which is based on the concept of task decomposition.</a>
