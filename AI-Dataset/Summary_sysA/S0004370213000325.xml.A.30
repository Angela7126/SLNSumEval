<a href="#0" id="0">For the general case in which the interval {a mathematical formula}[xmin,xmax] is continuous, the optimal search strategy must be derived using a different methodology since, as we prove in Theorem 1, the optimal search sequence is either a single search round in which the values of all agents are obtained or an infinite sequence of reservation values.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In contrast to Proposition 1, Proposition 2 states that the optimal strategy when there is no cost for initiating a new search round ({a mathematical formula} Α =0) is to increment the reservation value by the smallest amount possible, such that the expected number of values obtained is minimized.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">4 shows the expected cost, the expected number of search rounds, and the 99.9th percentile of the number of search rounds required to find the best-valued agent as a function of the number of agents N, for the different values of Α and function assignments to {a mathematical formula} Β (j).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The figure also shows the reservation values to be used in each search round when {a mathematical formula}N=20.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As expected, Α has a substantial effect on the search strategy and expected cost.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The reservation value increases as a function of Α , since the tradeoff associated with each reservation value accounts for a greater cost of continuing the search if no agent is found.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Although the expected number of search rounds decreases as a consequence, the expected cost still increases, due to the greater cost per round.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For large values of Α and all {a mathematical formula} Β (j) cost functions, the reservation probability is set such that the expected number of search rounds is close to 1 due to the substantial cost of initiating a new search round.</a>
