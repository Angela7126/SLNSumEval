<a href="#0" id="0">Second, we specify constraints on frequency, format and negative elements in order to reduce problem complexity, and in particular, to build a framework of NSP mining on set theory to extract negative sequential patterns from identified positive patterns (frequency constraint), reduce the number of NSC (format constraint), and substantially reduce the complexity in handling partially negative elements (negative element constraint).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, in [11], only the positive partner of each element in negative sequences ns is required to be frequent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In our work, we require that the positive partner, not only each element, of ns should be frequent, i.e., {a mathematical formula}sup(p(ns)) ≥ min_sup.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is because in this work we build a new framework that allows to only negative sequential patterns to be minded from positive sequential patterns by using the set theory to rapidly “ calculate ” the support of NSC based only on the support of their corresponding PSP without additional database scans.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From Equation (2), we can see that {a mathematical formula}sup(ns) can be easily calculated if we know {a mathematical formula}sup(MPS(ns)) and {a mathematical formula}| ∪ i=1n{p(1 − negMSi)}|.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">According to Constraint 3 and the negative candidate generation approach discussed in Section 4.5, {a mathematical formula}MPS(ns) and {a mathematical formula}p(1 − negMSi) are frequent.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}sup(MPS(ns)) can be directly obtained by applying traditional PSP mining algorithms.We further explain why the positive partners {a mathematical formula}p(1 − negMSi) are frequent.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Even in the worst situation in which the data is too big to fit completely into the main memory, by using the e-NSP candidate generation method for k-size positive sequential patterns, the size range of negative elements in the corresponding NSC is {a mathematical formula}1 → ⌜ k/2 ⌝ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Now we discuss the generalized representation of Equation (5), because the discussions later are all based on the generalized representation and {a mathematical formula}p(1 − negMSi) in Equation (5) is the support of a very detailed set {a mathematical formula}{p(1 − negMSi)}.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We use the average support of {a mathematical formula}{p(1 − negMSi)}, {a mathematical formula}sup ‾ (p(1 − negMSi)), instead of {a mathematical formula}sup(p(1 − negMSi)).</a>
