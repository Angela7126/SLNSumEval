<a href="#0" id="0">From Definition 5, the evidence set E will contain all the facts of the kind {a mathematical formula}c(x,y) relating alternatives x and y (that belong to the choice experiment posed to the decision maker) with respect to all the preference criteria referred by the distinguished literals in {a mathematical formula}C. In this way, by Proposition 2 and Corollary 1 it will always be possible to activate a primitive argumental structure Σ , warranted in {a mathematical formula}K, such that {a mathematical formula}cl( Σ )=Z with {a mathematical formula}Z ∈ {better(x,y),better(y,x),¬better(x,y),¬better(y,x)}, thus stating a strong preference ( ≻ ) in favor of one of the alternatives.</a>
