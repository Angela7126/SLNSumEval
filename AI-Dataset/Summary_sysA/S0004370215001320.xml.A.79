<a href="#0" id="0">The advantage of this approach is that it considers perturbations and includes feedback [29].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, relevant parameters are identified to reproduce motions similar to those made by the demonstrator, while similar motions can be adjusted based on the parameterization of the given goal, where the goals are generally provided manually in this case, i.e., the system (robot) will not be able to extract the meaning of the action because they do not possess reasoning capabilities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, the transfer of the models obtained to new situations is not straight forward.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Transferring the models acquired from human demonstrations to robots is another challenging task when building adaptive and autonomous robots, mainly because it requires the generation of task-specific robot motions that should fit naturally in a human environment.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This means the robot should generate motions based on the current task, the object type and the current state, while also considering information related to the context and environment.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This requires the analysis of stereotypical and pre-planned human motion patterns in order to acquire the desired task [32].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, the major advantage of these approaches is their ability to analyze the details of human movements [10].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{sup:2} This approach was used recently to segment and recognize an action from a library of OACs using the preconditions and effects of each sub-action, which allows a robot to reproduce the demonstrated activity [38].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It is important to note, the first attribute that must be correctly segmented is the hand motion, e.g., if the hand is not moving, we can predict the activity is either take or idle, which are defined by the object property ObjectInHand.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, using the tree obtained, we can determine six hypotheses {a mathematical formula}(Hsandwich), which represent semantic rules that describes the basic human activities.</a>
