<a href="#1" id="1">If {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (vk,vf) from an arbitrary {a mathematical formula}vk to {a mathematical formula}vf exists in G, then for any subset of robots Ω there exists an optimal path {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ Ω (vk Ω ,vf Ω ) which costs no more than the path taken by those robots in {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (vk,vf).</a>
