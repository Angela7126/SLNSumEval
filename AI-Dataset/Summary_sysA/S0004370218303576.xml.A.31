<a href="#0" id="0">In the following lemma, we show that at least one enforcement set exists and that enforcement sets are always non-empty if {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref is not a stable labelling.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Both are important properties for sets of arguments characterising parts of an AF responsible that a preferred labelling is not stable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since by Lemma 1 a revision exists w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">any set of arguments and labelling, it follows that there exists a revision w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">an enforcement set by an enforcement labelling and that the revision has a stable labelling that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Example 26</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consider again the SCUPs of {a mathematical formula}AF7 w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">its only preferred labelling {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref (see Example 24 on page 317).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let {a mathematical formula}LabArg be the in – out labelling illustrated in Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">16, which is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since a SCUP revision labelling is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref (because all arguments in SCUPs are labelled in or out by the SCUP revision labelling, but are labelled undec by {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref), it follows that there exists a preferred labelling of the SCUP revision that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Proof</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">By Proposition 16, there exists a labelling {a mathematical formula}LabArg of {a mathematical formula}AF with {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref ⊑ LabArg and {a mathematical formula}undec(LabArg)= ∅ such that, for all revisions {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ of {a mathematical formula}AF w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">S by {a mathematical formula}LabArg and all revision labellings {a mathematical formula}LabArg ⊛ of {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ , {a mathematical formula}LabArg ⊛ is a stable labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">It then follows from Theorem 12 that there exists an enforcement set {a mathematical formula}Args w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula}LabArgpref such that {a mathematical formula}Args ⊆ S.</a>
