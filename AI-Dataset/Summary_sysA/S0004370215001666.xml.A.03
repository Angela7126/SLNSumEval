<a href="#0" id="0">We note that the Semivalue-based between centrality can be normalized to the interval {a mathematical formula}[0,1] just like we did earlier with the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to compute the standard betweenness centrality measure for all nodes, a naïve algorithm would first compute the number of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, and then for each node v sum up all pair-dependencies, which are defined as {a mathematical formula} Σ st(v) Σ st.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Additionally, the above equation allows us to compute the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure in {a mathematical formula}O(|V|3), but this result will be improved further.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This way, we can use our general framework — PBC, see Algorithm 1 — to compute the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure in {a mathematical formula}O(|V||E|).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By doing so, we can use our general framework — WPBC, see Algorithm 4 — to compute the weighted Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure for all nodes in {a mathematical formula}O(|V|2|E|+|V|2log ⁡ |V|).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The black line depicts the network-performance measure when the network protection is based on the standard betweenness centrality measure (we denote this by {a mathematical formula}MB);</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Again, our measure outperforms the standard betweenness centrality measure in terms of network protection, with the relative improvement reaching up to {a mathematical formula}300%.</a>
