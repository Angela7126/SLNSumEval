<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we focus on just one decision type, made in the context of {a mathematical formula}LA ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}LIDA ⁎ — that of deciding whether to evaluate or to bypass the computation of {a mathematical formula}h2 for some node n. We have two options: (1) Evaluate the second heuristic {a mathematical formula}h2(n), and proceed using the value {a mathematical formula}fmax(n), or (2) bypass the computation of {a mathematical formula}h2(n) and use {a mathematical formula}f1(n), thereby saving time by not computing {a mathematical formula}h2, at the risk of additional expansions and evaluations of {a mathematical formula}h1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, we define a criterion based on the regret for bypassing {a mathematical formula}h2(n) in this context.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We define regret here as the value lost (in terms of expected increased run time) due to bypassing the computation of {a mathematical formula}h2(n), i.e., how much runtime is increased due to bypassing the computation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We wish to compute {a mathematical formula}h2(n) only if this regret is positive.</a>
