<a href="#0" id="0">Both studies, [37] and [36], reported results on the number of messages sent between agents (triggered by assignment changes) because they considered an asynchronous version of DSA.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In our work, we consider synchronous local search algorithms that perform in an asynchronous environment; thus, agents must exchange messages with all neighbors in every step of the algorithm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In standard local search algorithms (such as DSA and DBA), agents at each step send at least one message to each of their neighbors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The standard use of local search algorithms for DisCSPs and DCOPs prior to the proposal of the ALS_DCOP framework includes running an algorithm for some number of steps (m) and reporting the complete assignment (solution) held by the agents after the mth step.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This use of the algorithm favored exploitive algorithms such as MGM and DSA over explorative algorithms like DBA [7].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Distributed local search algorithms were originally proposed for Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems and subsequently applied for DCOPs [7].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, these algorithms failed to report the best state traversed by the algorithm, due to the challenge in evaluating global cost from the private, local costs of individual agents.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">To meet this challenge, we proposed ALS_DCOP, a general framework for performing distributed local search in DCOPs that provides them with the anytime property.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the proposed framework, agents use a spanning tree structure in order to accumulate the costs of a state of the system to the root agent, which compares the cost of each state with the cost of the best state found so far and propagates the step index of a new best state, once it is found, to all other agents.</a>
