<a href="#0" id="0">For each ℓ , {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ ℓ ≤ t, there must exist Round {a mathematical formula}z ℓ ′ such that {a mathematical formula}(s ℓ ˆ ,c ℓ ˆ ) ∈ Cz ℓ ′ ( ≻ ′ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show that {a mathematical formula}z ℓ ′ ≥ z ℓ +1 ′ holds for all ℓ , {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ ℓ ≤ t with {a mathematical formula}t+1=1, where under {a mathematical formula} ≻ ′ , the contract {a mathematical formula}(s ˆ ℓ ,c ˆ ℓ ) does not leave the mechanism before {a mathematical formula}(s ˆ ℓ +1,c ˆ ℓ +1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given that the supposition is true, {a mathematical formula}s ˆ ℓ cannot obtain any of the seats that are gone by the end of Round z under ≻ , when the input is {a mathematical formula} ≻ ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus {a mathematical formula}c ˆ ℓ +1, which is the school she receives at Round {a mathematical formula}z+1 under ≻ , must be the best possible assignment for her under the supposition and {a mathematical formula} ≻ ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">On the other hand, {a mathematical formula}s ˆ ℓ +1 has the highest priority in {a mathematical formula} ≻ ML to represent {a mathematical formula}c ˆ ℓ +1 among those whose assignments are not fixed by the supposition.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, if {a mathematical formula}((s ˆ ℓ ,c ˆ ℓ ),(s ˆ ℓ +1,c ˆ ℓ +1)){a mathematical formula} ∉ Ez ℓ ′ ( ≻ ′ ) is the case, then {a mathematical formula}(s ˆ ℓ +1,c ˆ ℓ +1) is already gone before Round {a mathematical formula}z ℓ ′ , i.e., {a mathematical formula}z ℓ ′ >z ℓ +1 ′ .</a>
