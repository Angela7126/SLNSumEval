<a href="#0" id="0">Many existing anytime search algorithms are loosely based on {a mathematical formula}WA ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Next, we describe {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ , which is a non-parametric anytime search algorithm using the PTS evaluation function {a mathematical formula}u( ⋅ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, we define the first ImproveSolution call of {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ to run pure heuristic search until the first solution is found.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}ARA ⁎ [6] is a well-known anytime search algorithm shown to be effective in many domains [27].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ would be inefficient in domains where pure heuristic search is inefficient.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Instead of using {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ to find the first solution, it is possible to use another algorithm (e.g., Speedy search [46]) to find the first solution and provide it to {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ as an initial incumbent solution.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this section we empirically evaluate the performance of PTS as a bounded-cost search algorithm, and {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ as an anytime search algorithm.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ dominates all other algorithms throughout the search.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this domain {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ is not always the best performing algorithm.</a>
