<a href="#0" id="0">A classical concept blending example is the blend between the concepts house and boat [34], [27].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">4 we depict the axiomatisation of these concepts which is similar to how they are proposed in [35].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Priorities are equal for all elements in the specifications, so we omit them here for brevity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The CASL theories for House and Boat introduce the sorts, operators and predicates that form the mental spaces house and boat by focusing on particular properties of these concepts.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The precise formalisation is not critical at this point, different ones exist [35], [63], but all provide similar distinctions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In principle, the House and Boat specifications could be directly blended (they do not generate any inconsistency), but the blended specification is not considered a good blend since it does not maximise the common relations among the two input specifications.</a>
