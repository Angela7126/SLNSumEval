<a href="#0" id="0">Despite the wide range of existing algorithms for BNs, naively unrolling the network for T time slices has multiple drawbacks: (1) the time complexity of inference depends on heuristics and is not guaranteed to scale linearly with T, (2) it requires {a mathematical formula}O(T) memory, and (3) the number T is often unknown which implies that adding a new time step requires inference in the complete network.</a>
