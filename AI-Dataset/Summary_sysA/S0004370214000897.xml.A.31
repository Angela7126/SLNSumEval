<a href="#0" id="0">In previous work [16], we characterized the worst-case optimal VCG redistribution mechanism, which maximizes the fraction of VCG payment that is redistributed in the worst case, among all VCG redistribution mechanisms that are individually rational and satisfy the non-deficit property.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The WCO mechanism is defined for all multi-unit auctions where each agent has nonincreasing marginal values for units.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:10} In the more restricted unit demand setting, the WCO mechanism uses the following redistribution function:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Here, {a mathematical formula}v − j,i is the i-th highest type among {a mathematical formula}v − j.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Under linear allocation mechanism {a mathematical formula}(a1,a2, … ,an), the mechanism's efficiency equals {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1naivi.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Agent i's VCG-based payment equals the following:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between linear allocation mechanisms and allocation vectors in {a mathematical formula}{(a1,a2, … ,an)|1 ≥ a1 ≥ a2 ≥ … ≥ an ≥ 0, ∑ i=1nai ≤ m}, essentially, we are solving for the optimal values of the {a mathematical formula}ai, as well as an optimal redistribution function R, so that the linear allocation mechanism {a mathematical formula}(a1,a2, … ,an) and R together have the highest competitive ratio.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This comes down to the following optimization model:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Optimal partitioning-based mechanism: One agent is chosen uniformly at random.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This agent receives one unit for free and is excluded from the auction.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The remaining seven agents compete for the remaining four units under the original VCG mechanism.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The VCG payments are redistributed to the excluded agent.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Redistribution is always {a mathematical formula}100% under this mechanism.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For the example type profile, the total valuation is 28.1250.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The efficiency ratio equals 0.9375 (slightly higher than the worst-case ratio {a mathematical formula} Α 1,1 ⁎ =0.925).</a>
