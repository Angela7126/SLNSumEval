<a href="#0" id="0">Therefore we calculate the translation consistency strength of a source term {a mathematical formula}tf based on topic distributions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We also compared our term translation consistency model against another two models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">“ Cons-No-Topic ” : This model is a simplified version of our term translation consistency model, which does not use any topic information.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This strongly suggest that terms are more consistently translated if we integrate the proposed term translation consistency model into the decoder.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 22 shows the translation probabilities of different target translations for the source term “ zhu3liu2 min2yi4 ” calculated by our term translation disambiguation model given the topic {a mathematical formula}z=32.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The differences between our term translation consistency model and their consistency index are twofold.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The term translation consistency model encourages the decoder to translate source terms with a high topic-dependent translation consistency strength into consistent target terms.</a>
