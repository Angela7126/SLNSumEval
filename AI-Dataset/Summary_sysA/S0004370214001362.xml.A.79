<a href="#0" id="0">A more refined approach is to weight the contribution of each retrieved track's tag vector, based on how similar it is to the query.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This increased number of pseudo-tags over the typical number of tags can provide problems when computing similarity between a pseudo-tag vector and tag vector, and so only the most relevant pseudo-tags should be selected.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using this method of combining pseudo-tags with tags, we are now able to represent every track by a hybrid vector h. For tracks which are well-tagged, the tag vector will be the main contributor to h, and therefore allow recommendation to be made using the strengths of tag representation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For tracks with a small number of tags, the pseudo-tag representation is given a higher weighting in the hybrid representation, and are allowed to control recommendation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To further examine how this dynamic generation of a hybrid representation affects recommendation, we show the results by the number of tags a query has, in Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">With the random method, when K is equal to the size of the training set, precision is reduced to that of the completely random system.</a>
