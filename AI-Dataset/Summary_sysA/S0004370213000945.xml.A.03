<a href="#0" id="0">With two pieces of independent and fully reliable evidence represented by two bpas {a mathematical formula}m1 and {a mathematical formula}m2 respectively, for any proposition {a mathematical formula} Θ ⊆ Θ , Dempster ʼ s rule is given as follows [25]{a mathematical formula} where ⊕ is the orthogonal sum operator.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Shafer ʼ s discountingSuppose {a mathematical formula}p( Θ ) is the degree of belief to which a piece of evidence points to a proposition Θ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We name the first term as the bounded sum of individual support from each of the two pieces of evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 for the proposition that an alternative is assessed to {a mathematical formula} Θ n.</a>
