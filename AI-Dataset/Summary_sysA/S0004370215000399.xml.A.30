<a href="#0" id="0">An alignment between two ontologies is a set of mapping elements.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A mapping element is a 5-tuple {a mathematical formula}(id,e,e ′ ,n,R), where:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">e and {a mathematical formula}e ′ are the entities of the first and the second ontologies, respectively,</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The alignment process can be seen as a function Φ where given a pair of ontologies O and {a mathematical formula}O ′ , a partial (and optional) input alignment A, a set of parameters p, a set of resources r, returns a new alignment {a mathematical formula}A ′ :{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}s → (c) is the vector of similarity measure results,</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}CorrO1 − O2 is the set of correspondences in a resulting alignment,</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This is done by means of the average of all the MatchFmeasure as follows:{a mathematical formula} where s is the number of pairs of ontologies to be aligned.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Next, we will perform a comparison by experiments among the baseline alignments, which set the weights of each similarity measures as {a mathematical formula}1/num (num is the number of similarity measures) and the threshold as 0.80, and the alignments obtained by MA using MatchFmeasure only and those by MA using both MatchFmeasure and UIR.</a>
