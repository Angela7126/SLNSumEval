<a href="#0" id="0">A coercive social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the value that the target assigns to the coercive action that the actor can perform ({a mathematical formula}Valueca), the target's achievement motivation ({a mathematical formula}AchievementMT) and the target's perception of the tendency of the actor to perform the coercive action ({a mathematical formula}CoercingT,A,ca).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A coercive social power is therefore inversely proportional to the value of the coercive action and directly proportional to the target's perception of the coercive tendency of the actor for that coercive action.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An expert social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the importance of the skill associated with that action ({a mathematical formula}Importances,C), the trust that the target agent holds for the actor agent ({a mathematical formula}TrustT,A) and the target's perception of the skill difference between the actor and the target ({a mathematical formula}LevelDA,T,s) regarding the skill associated with the action.</a>
