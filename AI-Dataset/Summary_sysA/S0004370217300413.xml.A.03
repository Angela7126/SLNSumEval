<a href="#2" id="2">Formally, the syntax of LTL is defined with respect to a set Φ of Boolean variables as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Φ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We say that Φ and Ψ are equivalent if for all Ρ we have {a mathematical formula} Ρ ⊨ Φ if and only if {a mathematical formula} Ρ ⊨ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula} Φ i ⊆ Φ is the (finite) set of variables controlled by {a mathematical formula}mi;</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The module {a mathematical formula}m( Σ i) then controls the variables {a mathematical formula} Φ i ′ = Φ i ∪ Qi.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, once {a mathematical formula} Σ → is specified in srml, the following result immediately follows from Lemma 2.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">( ⟹ ) First, suppose that player 0 has a winning strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ c in the given LTL game {a mathematical formula}(GLTL, Φ ,v0), which can be assumed to be of finite memory.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This strategy can be used to build a strategy profile {a mathematical formula} Σ m that is not a Nash equilibrium if, and only if, Φ is satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then, it follows that {a mathematical formula} Σ m ⊭ Φ ∧ q.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, if Φ is not satisfiable, then no strategy for m will satisfy {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ q, and hence {a mathematical formula} Σ m would be a Nash equilibrium in such a case.</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">Now, suppose that {a mathematical formula} Σ → ⊨ Φ .</a>

<a href="#14" id="14">A STRIPS game is then given by a structure{a mathematical formula} where A is a multi-agent STRIPS arena, and {a mathematical formula} Γ i is the temporal logic goal of player i; as with RMGs, we might consider LTL or CTL goals.</a>
