<a href="#0" id="0">Such subformula {a mathematical formula}E will be referred to as a Minimal Equivalent Subformula (MES) of {a mathematical formula}F. Intuitively, an MES of {a mathematical formula}F constitutes the result of removal of all redundant clauses from {a mathematical formula}F — these are the clauses whose removal does not change the set of models of {a mathematical formula}F.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As noted earlier, MES algorithms based on adapting existing MUS algorithms are unable to implement clause set refinement, and so cannot drop {a mathematical formula}k(k − 1)/2 clauses after the second SAT solver call.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If a literal l is a backbone literal, adding this literal as a unit clause to {a mathematical formula}F does not change the models of {a mathematical formula}F. Hence, whenever a backbone-computation algorithm detects that l is a backbone, it adds it to {a mathematical formula}F, which will help future SAT calls.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Noteworthy is the fact that the don't care group {a mathematical formula}D=CNF(¬F) used in Proposition 2 to construct the group-CNF formula {a mathematical formula}RF(E) from a subformula {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ F does not need to include the negation of the don't care group on the formula used as an input to the group-MES computation problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows: (i) Adapting existing MUS extraction algorithms for MES extraction; (ii) Development of model rotation for MES extraction, and analysis of why clause set refinement cannot be applied; (iii) Reduction of MES to group-MUS extraction, which enables both model rotation and clause set refinement to be applied; (iv) Use of chunks for incremental reduction of MES to group-MUS extraction, aiming at reducing the hardness of instances of SAT when the formula includes the negation of a CNF formula; (v) Extension of the techniques to the group-MES computation problem; (vi) Development of a very effective technique for pruning redundant clauses using backbone computation; and (vii) Development of a solution for the independent certification of the correctness of computed MESes.</a>
