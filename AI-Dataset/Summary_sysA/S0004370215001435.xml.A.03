<a href="#1" id="1">A MiniZinc model of the frequent itemset mining problem is shown in Listing 2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Modeling a mining problem in MiningZinc follows the same methodology as modeling a constraint program: one has to express a problem in terms of variables with a domain, and constraints over these variables; for example, a set variable with a minimum frequency constraint over data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Listing 8 contains some examples of constraint-based mining constraints that can be added to the frequent itemset mining model in Listing 2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">the set of FlatZinc constraints over {a mathematical formula}V1, … ,Vn that specify the problem this algorithm can solve (multiple sets can be given in case of multiple equivalent formulations);</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This constraint set is entailed by the set of constraints {a mathematical formula}C1={A=cover(I,D),B=card(A),V ≤ B}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">a set of constraints {a mathematical formula}C1;</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Recall that all specialized algorithms are registered with a predicate definition {a mathematical formula}p(±1V1, … ,±nVn) and a set of constraints C that define the problem being solved by this algorithm.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let {a mathematical formula}calcfreq(+I, − F,+D) be a specialized algorithm that calculates the frequency F of an itemset I in a database D. The constraint set corresponding to this algorithm is {a mathematical formula}{T=cover(I,D),F=card(T)}.</a>
