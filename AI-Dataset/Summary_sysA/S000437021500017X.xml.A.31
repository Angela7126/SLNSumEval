<a href="#0" id="0">In the above formulation, the agent has a fixed set of {a mathematical formula}n( ≥ 1) input exploratory options.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, the number of learnable target options is equal to the total number of learnable abstractions, which is at most equal to the number of input exploratory options:{a mathematical formula} To enable continual learning[29], the number of skills acquired by the agent should not necessarily be bounded and the agent needs to reuse the previously acquired skills to learn more complex skills.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, continual curiosity-driven skill acquisition learning problem is a slightly modified version of the above formulation, such that the target options learned form a basis for new input exploratory options:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}F(.)</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">At the core of the CCSA framework is the Curiosity Driven Modular Incremental Slow Feature Analysis Algorithm (Curious Dr. MISFA; [47], [48]).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{sup:3} The order in which skills are acquired in the CCSA framework is a direct consequence of the order in which the abstractions are learned by the Curious Dr. MISFA algorithm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The input to the Curious Dr. MISFA algorithm is a set of high-dimensional observation streams {a mathematical formula}X={x1, … ,xn:xi(t) ∈ RI,I ∈ N}, generated by the input exploratory-option's policies.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The result is a slow feature abstraction {a mathematical formula} Φ i corresponding to the easiest yet unknown observation stream.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Apart from learning the abstraction, the learning process also involves selecting the observation stream that is the easiest to encode.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To this end, Curious Dr. MISFA uses reinforcement learning to learn an optimal observation-stream selection policy, based on the intrinsic rewards proportional to the progress made while learning the abstraction.</a>
