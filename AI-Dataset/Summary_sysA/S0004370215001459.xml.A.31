<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we first present a competence enhancement method – NEFCS, to prevent noise from being included and to quickly adapt the case-base according to concept drift by the safe removal of obsolete cases.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Instead of blindly trusting all the most recent cases, NEFCS incorporates a concept drift detection method to differentiate the treatment on new cases based on whether there is concept drift.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition, as an on-line learning algorithm, NEFCS can take immediate advantage of any system feedback, enabling a fast response to possible concept drift.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since it is almost impossible to increase the case-base size without limit, we have also proposed a competence preservation method – SRR – to restrict the storage requirement.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Two main features of SRR are that: First, SRR tries to preserve the case distribution during each iteration, which is very important for concept drift problems, e.g., to prevent competence holes, to aid concept drift detection.</a>
