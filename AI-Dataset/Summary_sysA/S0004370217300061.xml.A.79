<a href="#0" id="0">The constraint satisfaction problem over a constraint language Γ ({a mathematical formula}CSP( Γ )) is the problem of finding a variable assignment which satisfies a set of constraints, where each constraint is constructed from a relation in Γ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let us for a moment go back to the simplest possible method for solving CSPs over a finite domain D: enumerate all assignments of values from D to the variable set V. This process yields a (very simple) algorithm running in {a mathematical formula}O(|D||V| ⋅ poly( ‖ I ‖ )) time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This method was originally used for the k-SAT problem with the aim of proving that k-SAT instances with only a linear number (in {a mathematical formula}|V|) constraints are still NP-complete and, in fact, that the ETH is still true for such instances.</a>
