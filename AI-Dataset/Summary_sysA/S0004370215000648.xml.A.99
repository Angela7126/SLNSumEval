<a href="#0" id="0">Similarly, we refer to the cost of a rational-valued constraint {a mathematical formula} Φ k as {a mathematical formula}ck(I,O) ∈ Q.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The feature space representation of an object {a mathematical formula}(I,O) is given by the feature vector{a mathematical formula} Ψ (I,O), which is a function of the constraints.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each soft constraint {a mathematical formula} Φ k has an associated finite weight {a mathematical formula}wk ∈ Q (to be learned from the data), while hard constraints have no associated weight.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This can be explained by observing that the cutting-plane algorithm does not actually require the separation oracle to be perfect: as long as the approximation is consistent with the hard rules (which is necessarily the case even in sub-optimal solutions), the constraint added to the working set {a mathematical formula}W at each iteration still restricts the quadratic program in a sound manner (see Algorithm 1).</a>
