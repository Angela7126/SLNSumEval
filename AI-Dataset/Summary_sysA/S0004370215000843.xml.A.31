<a href="#0" id="0">This is the approach taken by the KnowRob knowledge processing system that we present in this article.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It consists of a (rather shallow) symbolic knowledge base that provides semantic representations of the robot's data structures that primarily serves as integration layer for various inference algorithms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The representation can be shallow compared to expressive AI reasoning methods since few inferences are done at this level.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, it does not have to model the appearance of objects if the visibility reasoning algorithm can read it from a linked 3D model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">And it does not have to model physical laws if an algorithm for computing object stability can read its physical properties from a CAD model and parameterize a simulator with them.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The role of a KR system therefore shifts from a world model that has to be consistent and complete towards a semantic integration layer.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The correctness of inferences is then determined by the correctness of the algorithms rather than a complete and correct axiomatization that would anyway be difficult to guarantee if information is read from noisy sensors.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">One query to the knowledge base may require the use of different inference methods and different information sources.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For example, a robot may ask if its gripper has been inside a container during a pick-up task in order to verify that a pick-up action has been attempted.</a>
