<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula} The model is identical to the one for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal, except for the cost function and the functions {a mathematical formula}hkmax that define the system behavior.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Core model for Local Search The Local Search model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is identical to the base model presented in Section 3, and reported here for convenience:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Core model for MINLP A MINLP model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal can be obtained from the base model by linearizing the objective function:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">the Empirical Model that we employ for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax (see Section 7).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The full model for {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is as follows:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax is identical, except for the cost function and the definition of the efficiency variables:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Core model for SMT We did not design an SMT model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal, because the Empirical Model that we employ in this case is a Neural Network and we have not devised a technique for embedding ANNs in SMT.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We did however define an SMT model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We have employed the model fitting approach only for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal problem.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Results for the{a mathematical formula}WDPbal We obtained a LS approach based on the ACPI model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal by inserting the {a mathematical formula}hACPI(x) function into the core Local Search model from Section 6.</a>
