<a href="#1" id="1">As stated in Section 2, a way to compute a compact solution to the problem is to consider schedules where the activities are executed regularly with a fixed period (i.e.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, the relation:{a mathematical formula} is rewritten as:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} performing the usual eliminations we have the following inequality that no longer depends on Ω :{a mathematical formula} This is a very important result and it is equivalent to say that in a periodic schedule, if the (modular) precedence constraints are satisfied for iteration 0, then they are satisfied for every other iteration.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to model a temporal dependency {a mathematical formula} 〈 i,j, Θ (i,j), Δ (i,j) 〉 we have implemented a modular precedence constraint (ModPC), with the following signature:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}ei,sj, Η i, Β j, Λ are the variables representing the end time of activity i, the start time of activity j, their respective iteration numbers and the period.</a>
