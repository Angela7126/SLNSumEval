<a href="#0" id="0">Since the optimal sequence is infinite and the expected cost from each round onwards is stationary, the expected cost of using P can be expressed with the following equation:{a mathematical formula} Here, the first term is the fixed cost per round, the second term is the expected cost of obtaining any values, and the last term is the expected cost of continuing the search if necessary.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In contrast to Proposition 1, Proposition 2 states that the optimal strategy when there is no cost for initiating a new search round ({a mathematical formula} Α =0) is to increment the reservation value by the smallest amount possible, such that the expected number of values obtained is minimized.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For large values of Α and all {a mathematical formula} Β (j) cost functions, the reservation probability is set such that the expected number of search rounds is close to 1 due to the substantial cost of initiating a new search round.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">(11), we can formulate the expected cost of using this reservation probability as:{a mathematical formula} This expression is independent of any reservation values used during the search, thus completing the inductive step that shows that the expected cost of continuing the search from any state {a mathematical formula}(r,k) is some constant {a mathematical formula}Vk.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The expected cost of applying a strategy {a mathematical formula}S=[r1, … ,rm=xmax] is thus similar to (4), except that {a mathematical formula} Β (j) is replaced with the cost {a mathematical formula}V(j,ri − 1,ri) of conducting the optimal sequential economic search on j items whose values are between the last two reservation values used, {a mathematical formula}ri − 1 and {a mathematical formula}ri.</a>
