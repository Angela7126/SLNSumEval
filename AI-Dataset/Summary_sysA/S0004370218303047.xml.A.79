<a href="#0" id="0">We have so far considered that the input is a string encoding a Bayesian network specification {a mathematical formula}B, a query {a mathematical formula}(Q,E), and a rational number Γ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However in practice one may face a situation where the Bayesian network is fixed, and the input is a string consisting of the pair {a mathematical formula}(Q,E) and a rational number Γ ; the goal is to determine whether {a mathematical formula}P(Q|E)> Γ with respect to the fixed Bayesian network.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Denote by {a mathematical formula}QINF[B], where {a mathematical formula}B is a Bayesian network specification, the language consisting of each string {a mathematical formula}(Q,E, Γ ) for which {a mathematical formula}P(Q|E)> Γ with respect to {a mathematical formula}B.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">And denote by {a mathematical formula}QINF[L] the set of languages {a mathematical formula}QINF[B] where {a mathematical formula}B is a Bayesian network specification with definition axioms whose bodies are formulas in {a mathematical formula}L.</a>
