<a href="#0" id="0">Although the agent {a mathematical formula} Α i cannot plan using {a mathematical formula} Π i ▷ , as the resulting plan might not be executable in the multi-agent problem {a mathematical formula}M, it can be used for heuristic computation (the projected problem is in fact an abstraction of {a mathematical formula}M).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i ∈ A, the private part of its problem {a mathematical formula} Π i is</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A projected heuristic evaluates states based on the projected problem {a mathematical formula} Π i ▷ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The search terminates if any agent {a mathematical formula} Α i finds {a mathematical formula}s ▷ i s.t.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The MADLA Search uses two heuristics for each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i, a local projected {a mathematical formula}hLi and a distributed {a mathematical formula}hDi.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The search uses an open list for each of the heuristics {a mathematical formula}OLi,ODi for each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, the search node of agent {a mathematical formula} Α i is represented as follows.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Moreover, {a mathematical formula}hDi and {a mathematical formula}hLi denote the distributed and local heuristic evaluators of agent {a mathematical formula} Α i.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the MADLA Planner, the FF heuristic is used as the local heuristic {a mathematical formula}hLi.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The relaxed plan {a mathematical formula} Π j,iRE+ is maintained by {a mathematical formula} Α j throughout the whole computation of the heuristic estimate for the agent {a mathematical formula} Α i and a single state s, so that each action of {a mathematical formula} Α j is counted at most once.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This works thanks to the fact that each agent {a mathematical formula} Α k computes the heuristic estimate for at most one state at any moment.</a>
