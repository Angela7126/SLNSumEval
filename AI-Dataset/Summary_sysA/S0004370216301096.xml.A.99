<a href="#0" id="0">These results apply, for example, to the case of geometric progression OWAs, {a mathematical formula} ℓ -best OWAs, and {a mathematical formula} ℓ -med OWAs (for fixed values of ℓ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Further, when applied to the case of Borda-based utilities (which, as we have argued in Section 2.2, are non-finicky in a very strong sense), we obtain polynomial-time approximation schemes (that is, approximation algorithms that can compute solutions with an arbitrarily good precision, but whose running time depends polynomially only on the size of the problem but not necessarily on the desired approximation ratio).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">[8], has approximation ratio {a mathematical formula}O(n1/4+ Ε ), where n is the number of vertices in the input graph.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a further evidence that OWAs that are not nonincreasing are particularly hard to deal with from the point of view of approximation algorithms, we show that for an extreme example of an OWA family, i.e., for the K-med OWAs, there is a very strong hardness-of-approximation result.</a>
