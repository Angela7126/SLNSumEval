<a href="#0" id="0">First we randomly selected 3 out of the top 7 solvers from the previous competition (participants of the Sequential and Application {a mathematical formula}SAT+UNSAT Tracks of the SAT Competition 2014).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this year's SAT Race we did five runs for each solver benchmark pair.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:4} The solvers were compared based on the average number of problem instances solved within the time limit of one hour in the five runs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the 2015 SAT Race we introduced a new track for solvers supporting interactive incremental SAT solving â€“ the Incremental Library Track (ILT).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The ILT differs significantly from all the other (traditional) tracks of the SAT competitions in the following aspects:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The benchmarks for the traditional tracks are text files specifying a CNF formula.</a>
