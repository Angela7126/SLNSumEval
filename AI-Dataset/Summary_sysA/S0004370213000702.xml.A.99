<a href="#0" id="0">By Theorem 10 and Lemma 3, Σ -entailment between acyclic {a mathematical formula}ALC-TBoxes is {a mathematical formula}coNExpNP-hard when Σ is a concept signature.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It thus remains to note that we can use a small variation of the reduction from Σ -entailment to Σ -inseparability given in the proof of Lemma 3, replacing Σ -inseparability with checking self-contained modules.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In detail, let {a mathematical formula}T1,T2 be acyclic TBoxes and Σ a concept signature.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By our strengthened formulation of Theorem 10 (see comment before that theorem), we can assume that {a mathematical formula}T1 ∪ T2 is acyclic.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that we can also assume that {a mathematical formula} Σ =sig(T1) ∩ sig(T2).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">First, as in the proof of Lemma 3, we can assume that {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊇ sig(T1) ∩ sig(T2).</a>
