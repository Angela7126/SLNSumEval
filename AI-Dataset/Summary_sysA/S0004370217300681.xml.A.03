<a href="#0" id="0">(III) We develop a data clustering method based on the proposed HML-RF model by measuring pairwise similarity between visual samples for accurately discovering the semantic global group structure of all visual data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">(IV) We design three HML-RF tree structure driven tag prediction algorithms to recover missing tags for completing the local tag concept structure of individual visual data instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our goal is to exploit automatically the tag correlations and the available tag hierarchy structure effectively for inferring semantics on visual data and discovering visual concept structures.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Instead of learning a classifier, HML-RF is designed to infer visual semantic concept structure for more accurately revealing both global visual data group structures and local tag structures of individual visual data samples.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">SVM) are trained for individual tags using the available tags with visual features and their detection scores are then used as model input{sup:1}; (4) ViFeat&BiTag: both visual and tag data are utilised.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Whereas binary tag representations provide much more information about the underlying video data structure than visual feature modality, e.g.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We utilised both visual and tag data as model input since most methods can benefit from using both.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This also demonstrates that a joint exploitation of visual features, tags hierarchy as well as tag correlations can bring about significant benefits to visual semantic structure interpretation and global video clustering with sparse/incomplete tags.</a>
