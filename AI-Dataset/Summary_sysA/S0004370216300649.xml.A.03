<a href="#0" id="0">In order to analyze the community structure of the SAT instances obtained with our model, we have generated some sets of random formulas for different values of {a mathematical formula}Q ∈ {0.9,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.3} (hence {a mathematical formula}p=Q+1/c), and for different values of number of communities {a mathematical formula}c ∈ {10,20,40,80}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We observe that the modularity {a mathematical formula}Q ′ and the number of communities {a mathematical formula}c ′ are almost unaffected by these variations of n and {a mathematical formula}m/n.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For small values of the clause/variable ratio {a mathematical formula}m/n and the probability p, the number of clauses relating variables of the same expected community is very small.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In a second experiment, we generate families of instances with the same number of variables n and the same clause/variable ratios {a mathematical formula}m/n than in the previous experiment, and varying the number of communities c with a fixed modularity {a mathematical formula}Q=0.8.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, for small (big) values of {a mathematical formula}m/n, nearly all formulas are SAT (UNSAT).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We observe that the phase transition point {a mathematical formula}r ′ decreases as the modularity Q increases.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Before this restart, the solver was focused on community {a mathematical formula}c9, but all variables of communities {a mathematical formula}c3 and {a mathematical formula}c5 were also assigned (because the solver had also been focusing on these communities before {a mathematical formula}c9).</a>
