<a href="#0" id="0">For the thick case, we have a thick function {a mathematical formula}[f] from {a mathematical formula}Rn to {a mathematical formula}IRm and a thick set {a mathematical formula} 〚 Y 〛 ∈ IP(Rn).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This paper deals with the set-inversion problem {a mathematical formula}X=f − 1(Y) in the case where both f and {a mathematical formula}Y are uncertain, i.e., f belongs to the interval of functions {a mathematical formula}[f − ,f+] and {a mathematical formula}Y belongs to a thick set, i.e., an interval of sets {a mathematical formula} 〚 Y 〛 = 〚 Y ⊂ ,Y ⊃ 〛 .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">After introducing the new notions of thick intervals and thick boxes, a new algorithm for set inversion has been proposed.</a>
