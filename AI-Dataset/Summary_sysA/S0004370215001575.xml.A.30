<a href="#0" id="0">We added Hedetniemi's counterexamples as objects to the program and generated a second round of conjectures for upper bounds for the domination number of a graph; the results are in Table 13.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Several of these conjectures reappeared in the second round.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">All of these conjectures other than the first remain open.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Add existing bounds (ones proved in the literature) and conjectures to the program.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this way, the program could only produce conjectures that for which there is at least one example where the produced conjecture gives a better bound than any known theorem or conjecture.</a>
