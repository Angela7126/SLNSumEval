<a href="#0" id="0">The evaluation of a competition's effectiveness based on the scores of the teams over the years is important for better fueling the competition and the novel approach introduced in RoboCup@Home for addressing this issue is the main contribution of this article.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">After the first two years of RoboCup@Home competitions (2006 â€“ 2007), we discussed how to evaluate the performances in terms of measuring the improvements demonstrated by the teams in the tests over the years.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, to analyze the results of teams during the competition in more detail and to compare results over the years, we need a method to measure the performances of the teams in the tests with respect to the desired functionalities.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An important feature of a robotic competition is the setup of an environment in which it is possible to test integrated robotic systems in actual operational conditions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore the competition set up and the tests performed by the robots are important data sources for benchmarking.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The scoring system described above allows for analysis of the results of the teams in the different functionalities and can also be used to evaluate the progress of the entire competition, as explained in this section.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Define tests that require skills that address interesting research questions.Since RoboCup@Home is a scientific competition, teams must be motivated to solve important research problems.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this article, we presented analysis and performance measure of RoboCup@Home competition over time.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As discussed, a careful design of the scoring system allowed us not only to rank the teams in the competition but also to analyze the general performance of the teams.</a>
