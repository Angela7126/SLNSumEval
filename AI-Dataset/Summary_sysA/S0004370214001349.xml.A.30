<a href="#0" id="0">The extended SimStudent first acquires the representation of the problems using the deep feature learner.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then, it makes use of the learned representation to acquire skill knowledge in later tasks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Integrating the deep feature learner into the original SimStudent both reduces the amount of engineering effort and builds a better model of student learning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We then present the deep feature learning algorithm together with its evaluation results.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Next, we describe how to integrate the deep feature learner into SimStudent, and illustrate the algorithm with an example in algebra.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">After that, we present experimental results for both the original SimStudent and the extended SimStudent trained with problem sets used by real students in learning algebra, and show that the extended SimStudent is able to achieve performance comparable to the original SimStudent without requiring domain-specific knowledge as input.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We present a method for using SimStudent to automatically discover student models, and show that the student model discovered by the extended SimStudent is better than the human-generated models.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given the promising results shown above, we believe the proposed deep feature learner is effective in acquiring representation knowledge, and is a good model of real students.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To evaluate how the deep feature representation learner could affect the problem-solving learning of an intelligent agent, in this section, we present an integration of deep feature learning into such an agent, SimStudent.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As we have mentioned above, SimStudent is able to acquire production rules in solving complicated problems, but requires a set of operator functions given as prior knowledge.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Some of the operator functions are domain-specific and require expert knowledge to build.</a>
