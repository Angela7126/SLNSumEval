<a href="#0" id="0">For each article {a mathematical formula}w ∈ W ≥ we introduce a set of ℓ articles that are not contained in W and that cite w and no other article.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Together with the {a mathematical formula} ℓ − 1 articles in {a mathematical formula}W ≥ , this results in ℓ articles with ℓ citations and, hence, H-index at least {a mathematical formula} ℓ =h.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Next, for each article {a mathematical formula}w ∈ W ≥ , we introduce h new articles not in W that cite w and no other article.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Assume first that {a mathematical formula}(H, ℓ ) is a yes-instance and let S be an independent set of size ℓ in H. Then, merging all articles of S into one article in the Cautious H-Index Manipulation instance is valid since the compatibility graph G is a clique.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since articles in X do not cite each other and {a mathematical formula}aj+1 ∈ X, it follows that {a mathematical formula}aj+1 does not cite any article in {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
