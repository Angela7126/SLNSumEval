<a href="#0" id="0">A weighted state space problem {a mathematical formula}P=(S,A,s,T,w) consists of a set of states S, a finite set of actions A, an initial state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S, a set of goal states {a mathematical formula}T ⊆ S, and a cost function {a mathematical formula}w:A → R.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each action {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A is a function {a mathematical formula}a:S → S that transforms a state into a successor state incurring cost {a mathematical formula}w(a).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using the proposed heuristic function and breaking ties by generation order explores more than 5 million nodes to solve the instance, since several possible configurations of the stones on goal squares are explored before reaching the goal node.</a>
