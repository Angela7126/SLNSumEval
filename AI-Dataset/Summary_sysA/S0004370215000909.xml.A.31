<a href="#1" id="1">Occurrence probability of the fitness samples: It is evident from the proposed nonuniform partitioning of the sample space that the fitness samples in the longer intervals are rare samples, probably owing to noise, and hence their contribution to the true fitness estimate of {a mathematical formula}X → i should not be regarded similarly to that of the fitness samples in the smaller interval.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The noisy version of the kth objective {a mathematical formula}fk(X → ), of any trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → , is given by{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Η k represents the injected stochastic noise amplitude that follows a certain probability distribution function (PDF).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The following five variants of {a mathematical formula} Η k are considered here:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, under the circumstances of noisy fitness landscapes, there is a need to address the uncertainty related to the fitness measurements while determining the hypervolume of the approximate Pareto front A.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The uncertainty problem is resolved here by weighting the size of the objective space covered by a nondominated solution {a mathematical formula}X → with the probability that {a mathematical formula}X → dominates at least one population member.</a>
