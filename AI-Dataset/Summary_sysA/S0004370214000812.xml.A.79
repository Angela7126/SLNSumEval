<a href="#0" id="0">Roughly speaking, in our approach, we consider a set of individuals S in a network to be a most influential set, with respect to a particular goal of interest, if S is the most preferred subset among all those that satisfy the following condition: were the individuals in S to choose the behavior {a mathematical formula}xS prescribed to them by a desired stable outcome {a mathematical formula}x ≡ (xS,x − S) which achieves the goal of interest, then the only stable outcome of the system that remains consistent with their choices {a mathematical formula}xS is x itself.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Said more intuitively, once the nodes in the most influential set S follow the behavior {a mathematical formula}xS prescribed to them by a desired stable outcome x achieving the goal of interest, they become collectively “ so influential ” that their behavior “ forces ” every other individual to a unique choice of behavior!</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that both of the functions just presented ignore the set S. One alternative that does not is {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ ∑ i ∈ Stixi − ∑ i ∉ Stixi, where the {a mathematical formula}ti's reflect a weighted preference over individual nodes, thus capturing our interest in some “ weighted maximum set of adopters. ”</a>
