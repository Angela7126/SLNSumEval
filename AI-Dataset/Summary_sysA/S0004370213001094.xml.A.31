<a href="#1" id="1">For an AC program Π , a set X of atoms is called an answer set of Π if there is a functional set M of ground mixed atoms of Σ such that X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}ground ⁎ ( Π ) ∪ M.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For an AC program Π , by {a mathematical formula} Π Ξ we denote a set of rules consisting of (i) choice rules {a mathematical formula}{a Ξ } for each constraint and defined atom a occurring in {a mathematical formula} Π R, and (ii) {a mathematical formula} Π R whose mixed atoms are dropped, and constraint and defined atoms are replaced by their names.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">The graph {a mathematical formula}AC Π can be used for deciding whether a weakly-simple AC program Π has an answer set by constructing a path from ∅ to a terminal node: For any weakly-simple AC program Π ,</a>
