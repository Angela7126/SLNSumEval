<a href="#0" id="0">As a consequence, our focus is mostly on handling the integration of Machine Learning models in optimization: for example, we emphasize the importance of model embedding techniques (in Section 5), and of methods to exploit the structure of the extracted model for boosting the search process.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Black box optimization Black-box optimization approaches are concerned with finding solutions for optimization problems having cost or constraint functions with unknown structure: the typical case is that of systems lacking a declarative model, but for which a simulator is available.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is done by relying on a set of functions {a mathematical formula}hkbal:{0,1}n â†’ (0,1], each of which associates a mapping of all jobs to a value for the {a mathematical formula}effk variable, representing the efficiency of core k. A base model for the second problem variant can be formulated as follows:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In EML, this means that the Empirical Model constraints in the formulation from Section 4 are in fact a combination of two relations:{a mathematical formula} where y is a vector of variables representing the features, {a mathematical formula}hEM is the encoding of the Machine Learning model, and {a mathematical formula}hfeat are feature extraction constraints.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Linear regression makes it feasible to obtain values for all the parameters; however, it also requires one to build a training set, and therefore an overall design effort much closer to that of extracting an Artificial Neural Network.</a>
