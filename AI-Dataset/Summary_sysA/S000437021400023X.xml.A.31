<a href="#0" id="0">To apply a symmetry {a mathematical formula}g ∈ G to a propagator tree we define an image function in Definition 12.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While we have shown that using symmetry-reduced trees can, in highly symmetric constraints, produce a polynomial bound in tree size, these polynomials can be extremely large.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, for a constraint with total variable symmetry and variables of domain size 3 the upper bound is {a mathematical formula}O(n23).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this section we will substantially tighten this bound.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 9, Table 10 also show that propagator trees compare well to the generic GAC propagators as the arity is increased.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}STR2+ is the fastest of the generic GAC propagators and it is consistently slower than all propagator tree methods.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Of the three problems, only Life can be used to compare propagator trees with symmetry-reduced trees.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The Life constraint has {a mathematical formula}8!=40,320 symmetries, the standard propagator tree has 26,524 nodes and the symmetry-reduced tree has 410 nodes.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Table 11 shows that the symmetry-reduced tree is less efficient than the standard tree on this problem, taking up to 3 times longer to solve to optimality.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Code generation proved to be somewhat more efficient than the VM for the symmetry-reduced tree.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The Immigration constraint has {a mathematical formula}8!×2=80,640 symmetries.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">It is not possible to generate the standard propagator tree within 12 GB of memory.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The symmetry-reduced tree has 34,712 nodes.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The Brian's Brain constraint has {a mathematical formula}8!=40,320 symmetries.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">It is not possible to generate the standard propagator tree for this constraint within 12 GiB of memory.</a>
