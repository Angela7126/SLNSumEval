<a href="#0" id="0">In our experiment we set {a mathematical formula}N=440 which is approximately the average number of overall diagnoses found per system and M was not set to a fixed number but rather to the cardinality of the initial candidate diagnosis (the number of faulty components in the initial consistent candidate diagnosis).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although the proposed online stopping condition is very simple, the results in Table 15, Table 16 show that the resulting values for {a mathematical formula} Δ =0.1 are almost exactly the same as those obtained for health states generated from all diagnoses ({a mathematical formula} Δ =0).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our approach uses the residual difference to calculate the added value of finding more diagnoses, and presents as an output the health state – the likelihood of each component to be faulty.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For all quality metrics, the health state quality tends to converge quickly to a relatively high (i.e., good) value, where in most cases a fraction of the diagnoses are needed to obtain a health state that is almost as accurate as the one generated using all diagnoses.</a>
