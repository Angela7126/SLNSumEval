<a href="#0" id="0">Here, we analyze the scope and limits of simulation as a technique of automated physical reasoning for general AI.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">One could perhaps simulate that as well, but obviously the reasoning needed to figure out that this simulation is relevant and to set up the simulation is much more complex than the simulation itself.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If there is no human in the loop, then it would be very desirable for the physical reasoning system to be able to detect these kinds of problems by itself.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If the simulation is the only reasoning mechanism, this cannot be done.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Simulation is effective for automated physical reasoning when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of scales involved, both temporal and spatial, is not extreme.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For simulation to serve as a general solution to the problem of physical reasoning, in either human or automated form, all would need to be solved.</a>
