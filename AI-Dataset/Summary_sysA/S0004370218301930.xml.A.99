<a href="#0" id="0">For the sake of clarity we will first consider the case {a mathematical formula}K ≥ 2 and refer to the adjustments for the {a mathematical formula}K=1 case subsequently.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In case {a mathematical formula}K ≥ 2, Proposition 1 restricts the value of Δ to be in the range {a mathematical formula}b − a2 ⋅ K< Δ <b − a2 ⋅ (K − 1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let us fix the value of Δ to be {a mathematical formula}(b − a) ⋅ 2 ⋅ K − 14 ⋅ (K − 1) ⋅ K, which is the center of the restricted range.Consider the case that the player's state, before changing her strategy, is {a mathematical formula}Fl<K.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In such a case, the change in the global potential, is {a mathematical formula}b − a − 2 ⋅ l ⋅ Δ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since the upper bound of l is {a mathematical formula}K − 1 and Δ is positive, the following inequality holds:{a mathematical formula}A change to the global potential of {a mathematical formula}a − b+2 ⋅ l ⋅ Δ will occur if the player's state before the strategy update is {a mathematical formula}Tl ≥ K.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Such a change results in the following inequality:{a mathematical formula}Consequently, the minimal improvement to the global potential, as a result of a better-response step, is {a mathematical formula}b − a2 ⋅ K when {a mathematical formula}K ≥ 2.In case {a mathematical formula}K=1 the only possible value of l is zero when the player's state is {a mathematical formula}Fl<K, which makes Equation (14) trivial.</a>
