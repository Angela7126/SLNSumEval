<a href="#0" id="0">Linear conflictA triple {a mathematical formula}(q,r,m) ∈ Q3 where squares q and r are adjacent is a linear conflict if for an instance in state {a mathematical formula}u=(m,p) ∈ S with only two stones placed at q and r, and for all states {a mathematical formula}u ′ ∈ Succ(u), {a mathematical formula}hMM(u ′ ) ≥ hMM(u)+1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using the proposed heuristic function and breaking ties by generation order explores more than 5 million nodes to solve the instance, since several possible configurations of the stones on goal squares are explored before reaching the goal node.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To investigate the potential of using PDBs with larger abstractions, we determined for all instances the smallest {a mathematical formula}k ′ such that the optimal solution can be found within our standard resource limits (one hour, 20M nodes).</a>
