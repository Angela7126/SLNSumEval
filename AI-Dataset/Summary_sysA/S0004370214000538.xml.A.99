<a href="#0" id="0">In particular, this problem focuses on identifying the ranking of the arms, given a threshold for the number of total pulls (budget).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we will explain later in Section 4.2, within the exploration phase, our bounded Ε -first approach relies on an approximation method that aims to choose arms with highest reward-cost density values.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, the pure exploration problem can be regarded as a sub-problem within the exploration phase, where we aim to achieve efficient exploration (i.e., quickly identify the highest ranking arms).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The expectation of {a mathematical formula}GB(A) is:{a mathematical formula} Then, let {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ denote an optimal solution that maximises the expected total reward, that is:{a mathematical formula} Note that in order to determine {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ , we have to know the value of {a mathematical formula} Μ i in advance, which does not hold in our case.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ represents a theoretical optimal algorithm, which is unachievable in general (but which we will use in Section 6 to benchmark our approach).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Specifically, the quality distribution is the sum of two random variables, {a mathematical formula}0.9 ⋅ Ri+0.1 ⋅ U(0,1), where {a mathematical formula}Ri is the empirical distribution of the user's actual ratings obtained on previous jobs{sup:13} and {a mathematical formula}U(0,1) is the continuous uniform distribution on the interval {a mathematical formula}[0,1] (to add a small amount of noise).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that our algorithm approaches the theoretical optimum by up to {a mathematical formula}75% (in the cases of moderate, large and extreme budgets), while it achieves {a mathematical formula}61% of the optimal solution's performance in the scenario with small budgets.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Furthermore, the empirical results confirmed our theoretical bounds, indicating that the algorithm works best for projects with large budgets.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As a result, our work could potentially form a promising basis to crowdsourcing websites which aim to provide efficient teams of experts.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Furthermore, our model considers independent tasks, where the total utility of the tasks is the sum of each individual task's utility.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, tasks may affect each other's value, and thus, the total utility of these tasks may not be equal to their sum of utility.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, two tasks may contain overlapping parts.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This implies that their total utility is less than their sum.</a>
