<a href="#0" id="0">An important difference between this and the benchmark domains considered so far in planning, is that the calculation of the numeric quantities requires the solution of a set of non-linear (in this case, power flow) equations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These problems are interesting for planning if the control actions take a significant amount of time relative to variations generated by the background processes (or, equivalently, if the control system is slow to react to changes in the background processes), or if the BTMP appears in the context of additional goals that require discrete causal reasoning alongside the management of the trajectory constraints.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Without infinity analysis, once the action can be applied in the TRPG, the end point would have to be applied at multiple time points (to obtain the accumulated effects of multiple applications of the increase effect) and these would be separated only by Ε since the relaxation would allow the same action end point to be applied repeatedly once its preconditions were satisfied ( Ε separation is required, because the TRPG must advance time by a minimum amount before constructing the next layer of the graph).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The number of passive elements is not an issue for the planner: we observe an increase in the running time, due to the time spent by the external solver to compute the solution of the power flow equations, but this does not affect the number of states evaluated by the planner.</a>
