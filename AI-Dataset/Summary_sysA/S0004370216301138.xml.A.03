<a href="#0" id="0">Our approach to evaluating solver performance after configuration could of course be transferred to any other competition.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We then executed only this configuration on the test set to determine the performance of the configured solver.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Lingeling[16] is a CDCL solver with 241 parameters (making it the solver with the largest configuration space in the CSSC 2013).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We then executed only this configuration on the test set to assess the performance of the configured solver.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">1 visualizes the results of the configuration process for the winning solver Lingeling on these four benchmark sets.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">2 visualizes the improvements algorithm configuration yielded for the best-performing solver Clasp-3.0.4-p8 on these benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Table 5 summarizes the results we obtained for all solvers on these benchmarks, showing that configuration also substantially improved the performance of many other solvers.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">4 visualizes the results of applying algorithm configuration to the winning solver Lingeling on these three benchmark sets.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For each of these categories, we used various benchmark sets, each of them split into a training set to be used for algorithm configuration and a disjoint test set.</a>
