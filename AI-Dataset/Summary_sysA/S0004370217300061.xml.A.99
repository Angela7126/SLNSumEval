<a href="#0" id="0">In Section 4.1 we consider algorithms for {a mathematical formula}CSP(B ∨ Ω ) based on structure enumeration, and in Section 4.2, we consider algorithms for {a mathematical formula}CSP(B ∨ Ω ) and {a mathematical formula}CSP(B ∨ k) based on domain enumeration.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Lower bounds can also be obtained for the branching time problem {a mathematical formula}CSP(P ∨ Ω ) since there is a trivial reduction from {a mathematical formula}CSP(T) ∨ Ω which does not increase the number of variables: simply add a constraint {a mathematical formula}(x<y ∨ x>y ∨ x=y) for every pair of variables in the instance.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Similarly, the equality constraint satisfaction problem {a mathematical formula}CSP(E ∨ Ω ) is not solvable in {a mathematical formula}O(c|V|) time for any {a mathematical formula}c>1 either, unless the SETH fails.</a>
