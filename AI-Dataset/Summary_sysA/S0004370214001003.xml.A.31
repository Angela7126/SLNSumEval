<a href="#0" id="0">Once the signatures of a single appliance instance have been extracted from aggregate data, the aim is to tune the general model to include the behaviour of the appliance instance which is unique to the previously unseen household.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given that both the general model for this appliance type, Θ , and signatures sampled from the specific appliance instance are available, {a mathematical formula}x¯i:j, Bayesian integration [15] provides a natural approach to infer the posterior distribution over such appliance instance parameters with the state sequence marginalised out:{a mathematical formula} Therefore, we update the general model again using variational message passing as described in Appendix A.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also developed a method by which general appliance models can be tuned to the specific appliance instances in a household given only aggregate data as would be collected by a smart meter.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The method uses these general models to identify and extract power signatures of individual appliances from the aggregate load, which are subsequently used to tune the general appliance models.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We showed that appliance models built using this tuning method explain sub-metered data with a higher likelihood than had the general models been used, and in cases where sufficient signatures can be extracted, such tuned models perform comparably to had sub-metered data been used to tune the models.</a>
