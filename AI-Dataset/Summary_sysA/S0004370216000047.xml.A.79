<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, in case of program {a mathematical formula} Π ′ one can define an external atom {a mathematical formula}&nodes[](Y), which returns all nodes Y in the graph, and add a rule {a mathematical formula}d(Y) ← &nodes[](Y) to the program to compute the domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The domain atom {a mathematical formula}d(Y) can then be added to the bodies of all rules which use the external domain (in {a mathematical formula} Π ′ this is rule {a mathematical formula}r3 ′ ) in order to make the program strongly safe and allow for evaluating it using the traditional methods.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then {a mathematical formula}Ap ∖ Ap ′ must contain at least one atom which is not a replacement atom or an input auxiliary atom, because by construction of {a mathematical formula}Ap such atoms are only set to true if necessary, i.e., if they are supported by A, and all rules used to derive such atoms are also in {a mathematical formula}fgrndC( Π p)Ap.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We now show that the restriction of A to ordinary atoms {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊊ A (i.e., without replacement atoms {a mathematical formula}e&g[y](x) and {a mathematical formula}ne&g[y](x) and without external atom input atoms {a mathematical formula}ginp&g(y)) is a model of {a mathematical formula}fgrndC( Π )A, which contradicts the assumption that A is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}grndC( Π ).Note that, except for the external atom guessing and input auxiliary rules, the reduct {a mathematical formula}fgrndC( Π p)Ap contains the same rules as {a mathematical formula}fgrndC( Π )A with replacement atoms instead of external atoms.</a>
