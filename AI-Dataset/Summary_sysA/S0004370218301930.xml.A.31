<a href="#0" id="0">Algorithm 2, below, is an extended version of Algorithm 1 that handles the general version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The main difference between the algorithms is that for the general version of PGG there is no guarantee regarding the improvement of the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Nevertheless, the experimental evaluation of Section 7 demonstrates that in practice Algorithm 2 yields stable outcomes of greater efficiency than that of the initial outcome.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The lack of theoretical guarantees regarding the efficiency of the outcomes stems from the fact that according to Algorithm 1 each player may secure a transfer of payoffs to at most one of its neighbors.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This observation does not hold in the general case when {a mathematical formula}K>1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Similarly to the simple version, Algorithm 2 terminates when a pass through all the players of the game does not yield any changes to the players' strategies.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It is easy to see that the average efficiency of the outcomes obtained by the proposed method is higher than those obtained by better-response dynamics (Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">5) for both cases ({a mathematical formula}K=1 and {a mathematical formula}K=3).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For the simple version, where {a mathematical formula}K=1, the improvement in SW of Algorithm 1 is relatively small (Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">5a).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, for general PGGs with {a mathematical formula}K=3 the improvement in social welfare obtained by Algorithm 2 is quite close to that of the best PNEs (Fig.</a>
