<a href="#0" id="0">Section 4 develops query complexity results for certain forms of monotone predicates; it is shown that minimal sets for these predicates can be computed with a logarithmic number of calls to an NP oracle that provides a witness (the class {a mathematical formula}FPNP[wit,log]).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Section 5 extends the results of the previous section for function problems that have exactly a constant number of minimal sets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is shown that all predicates of the form {a mathematical formula}B have a unique minimal set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Further, for all predicates of forms {a mathematical formula}L and {a mathematical formula}B, a minimal set can be calculated by a logarithmic number of calls to a witness oracle.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The function problem of computing the set of independent variables of{a mathematical formula}F(FVInd) has a unique minimal set.</a>
