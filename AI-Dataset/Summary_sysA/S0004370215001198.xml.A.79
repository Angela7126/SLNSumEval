<a href="#0" id="0">The proof is based on a reduction from the set-packing decision problem — where we are given a constant q and a family of sets {a mathematical formula}S and we need to determine whether a set of q mutually-disjoint sets exists — to the following decision problem: given a characteristic function with which every coalition in {a mathematical formula}S has a value of 1, and every coalition outside of {a mathematical formula}S has a value of 0, determine whether a coalition structure exists whose value is at least q.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By computing {a mathematical formula}UB ⁎ , we can establish a bound on the quality of the best coalition structure found at any point in time, denoted by {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ ⁎ ; this bound is {a mathematical formula} Β =UB ⁎ /V(CS ⁎ ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In other words, {a mathematical formula}R ′ is feasible if there exists a coalition structure CS such that every rule {a mathematical formula}r ∈ R ′ is applicable to some {a mathematical formula}C ∈ CS.</a>
