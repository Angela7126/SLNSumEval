<a href="#1" id="1">We used HBA to control player 1 and a fixed type in each play to control player 2, which was included in the set of hypothesised types {a mathematical formula} Θ 2 ⁎ provided to HBA (discussed in detail in Section 5.6).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We specified a total of 10 different methods to automatically compute prior beliefs {a mathematical formula}Pj for a given set of types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ :</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In each play, we randomly generated 9 unique types and provided them to HBA along with the true type of player 2, such that {a mathematical formula}| Θ 2 ⁎ |=10.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">(That is, each play had a pure type distribution; cf.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Section 3.1) Thus, the true type of player 2 was always included in the set of hypothesised types {a mathematical formula} Θ 2 ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We can show that Property 1 holds if the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i with positive expected payoff in X.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We can show that Property 2 holds if the type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i which lead to states into which X may get as well.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We can show that Property 3 holds if the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i which X might have chosen as well.</a>
