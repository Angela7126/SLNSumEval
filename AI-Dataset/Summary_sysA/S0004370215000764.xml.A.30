<a href="#0" id="0">Our goal is to develop an intrinsically motivated curious agent using RL.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We therefore evaluate texplore-vanir in four ways on a complex domain with no external rewards.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, we measure the accuracy of the agent's learned model in predicting the domain's transition dynamics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Second, we test whether the learned model can be used to perform tasks in the domain when given a reward function.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Third, we examine the agent's exploration to see if it is exploring in a developing, curious way.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, we demonstrate that texplore-vanir can combine its intrinsic rewards with external rewards to learn faster than if it was given only external rewards.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These results demonstrate that the intrinsic rewards and model learning approach texplore-vanir uses are sufficient for the agent to explore in a developing curious way and to efficiently learn a transition model that is useful for performing tasks in the domain.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Second, we test whether the learned model can be used to perform tasks in the domain when given a reward function.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">These results demonstrate that the intrinsic rewards and model learning approach texplore-vanir uses are sufficient for the agent to explore in a developing curious way and to efficiently learn a transition model that is useful for performing tasks in the domain.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These results show that texplore-vanir's intrinsic rewards drive the agent to explore more of the state space and discover more affordances in the task than if the agent explored randomly.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Exploring with texplore-vanir enables the robot to learn a more accurate model of more of the state space and perform better on possible tasks given to the robot after exploring the domain.</a>
