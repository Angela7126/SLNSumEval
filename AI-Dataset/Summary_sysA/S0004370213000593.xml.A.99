<a href="#0" id="0">Interestingly, even for resolution-based preferred extensions (which we do not explicitly consider in this paper), {a mathematical formula}Epr ⁎ ={{P,F},{Q,B}}=Egr ⁎ , so that, again, {a mathematical formula}Epr ⁎ ie= ∅ but {a mathematical formula}{F,B} is both admissible with no attacking argument satisfying {a mathematical formula}capr ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence Proposition 3 and Proposition 4 fail to hold for base semantics which are resolution based.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, Algorithm 1 is not fully satisfying, as it cannot capture all interesting base semantics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} ⋂ i=1nEi= ⋂ E ∈ E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )E. This is by the fact that the number of guessed extensions is equal to the number of arguments in the framework.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, for every guess it holds that {a mathematical formula} ⋂ E ∈ E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )E ⊆ Ssa.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If {a mathematical formula}x ∈ E Σ ie( 〈 X,A 〉 ), i.e.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">there is an admissible set {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊆ ⋂ E ∈ E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )E with {a mathematical formula}x ∈ S ′ , then for every such guess, we have {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊆ Ssa and thus {a mathematical formula}x ∈ A.</a>
