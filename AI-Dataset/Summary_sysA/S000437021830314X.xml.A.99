<a href="#2" id="2">Following [5], perhaps the simplest extension to make all this precise is to assume that deterministic actions such as {a mathematical formula}move(x) now have companion action types {a mathematical formula}move(x,y) in {a mathematical formula}L. The intuition is that x represents the nominal value, which is the number of units that the agent intends to move, while y represents the actual distance moved.</a>
