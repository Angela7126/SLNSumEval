<a href="#0" id="0">The final score of a candidate c for a given profile {a mathematical formula}a ∈ An in the Plurality game form {a mathematical formula}fs ˆ ,w is the sum of the initial score and the total weight of strategic voters that vote for c. We denote the final score vector by {a mathematical formula}ss ˆ ,w,a (often just {a mathematical formula}sa or s when the other parameters are clear from the context), where {a mathematical formula}s(c)=s ˆ (c)+ ∑ i ∈ N:ai=cwi.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The properties of strong, weak and order-free convergence can be defined in the same way as for best and better replies, where the only difference is in the way of defining the set {a mathematical formula}Ii(a) (i.e., the set of all steps that are allowed for agent i at state a by the considered heuristics).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However the number of possible action profiles is exponential in n. We will define a voting rule/game form with {a mathematical formula}2n+1 outcomes, such that almost all {a mathematical formula}2n profiles yield the same outcome z, with “ special ” profiles that are few (only 2n) and far between (several steps are required to get from one special profile to another).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It remains an open question whether there is any restriction on better replies that guarantees order-free acyclicity in weighted games, i.e., if {a mathematical formula}fwPL is order-free-FIP for any {a mathematical formula}n>2 and weights w. However, Proposition 4.6 shows that if such a restricted order-free dynamic exists, it must make use of indirect replies, which is rather unnatural.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We thus conjecture that such order-free dynamics do not exist.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have seen in Section 4 that while {a mathematical formula}fPR is FBRP from the truthful initial state, this is no longer true from arbitrary states, and in fact {a mathematical formula}fPR is not order-free-FIP under any action scheduler.</a>
