<a href="#0" id="0">CSGA CSG is the coalitional game Γ in a coalitional skill domain, where the players are the agents of the coalitional skill domain, and the characteristic function of a coalition is the value of the tasks that coalition can perform: {a mathematical formula}v Γ (C)=u(T(C)).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The most restricted form of CSGs is that of STSG — a Single Task Skill Game.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In an STSG, there is only one task t, whose set of required skills {a mathematical formula}S(t) are all the skills in the domain, so we have {a mathematical formula}S(t)=S.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In STSGs, the task value function is {a mathematical formula}u({t})=1, and {a mathematical formula}u( ∅ )=0.</a>
