<a href="#0" id="0">If there is a human in the loop, they can examine the output of the simulator and at least see that this cannot be right, particularly if the simulator outputs an animation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If there is no human in the loop, then it would be very desirable for the physical reasoning system to be able to detect these kinds of problems by itself.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the simulation is the only reasoning mechanism, this cannot be done.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Simulation is effective for automated physical reasoning when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of scales involved, both temporal and spatial, is not extreme.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If these conditions do not hold, then simulation becomes to some extent problematic.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have identified many categories of problems where these conditions do not hold, and demonstrated by examples that these categories include many natural and simple examples.</a>
