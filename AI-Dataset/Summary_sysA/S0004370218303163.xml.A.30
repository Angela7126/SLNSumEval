<a href="#0" id="0">In contrast, in the present framework all the observations have the same status, and the objective of the interpretation process is to provide an interpretation of what is observed at the highest possible abstraction level in terms of the underlying processes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we will see later, some observables may stand out amongst others regarding the efficiency of the interpretation process, as salient features that can draw some sort of perceptual attention.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As discussed above, any observable {a mathematical formula}q ∈ QP can appear multiple times as different pieces of evidence for an abstraction pattern P, in the form of findings collected in the set {a mathematical formula}MP.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a consequence, P can predict multiple observations of the set {a mathematical formula}O for a given observable {a mathematical formula}q ∈ QP, each of these corresponding to one of the findings of the set {a mathematical formula}MP through a matching relation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">According to Algorithm 2, the ABDUCE() function is used to move forward the interpretation, since the focus of attention points to an observation {a mathematical formula}oPw.</a>
