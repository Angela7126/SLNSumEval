<a href="#0" id="0">We assume that both the teacher and learner can determine whether a meaning is denoting in a situation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is the only possible meaning that the learner guesses for this utterance because there is no supported meaning with the predicate sequence {a mathematical formula}(gr1,re1), and no other inequivalent supported meaning with the predicate sequence {a mathematical formula}(sq1,re1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the learner produced no utterance or an uncorrectable one, or if the teacher did not choose to correct the learner's utterance, then the teacher's utterance is chosen uniformly at random from the denoting utterances for the situation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, the teacher translates the incorrect learner utterance el elipse pequeno into the predicate sequence {a mathematical formula}(el1,sm1) despite the errors of agreement in the utterance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The learner may also classify a teacher utterance as a correction when it is not intended as a correction.</a>
