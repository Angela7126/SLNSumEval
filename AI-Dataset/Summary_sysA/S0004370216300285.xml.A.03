<a href="#0" id="0">The performance of algorithms {a mathematical formula}BI Α Β and {a mathematical formula}DO Α Β represent a significant improvement over the results of the pruning algorithm SMAB presented in [38].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is an easy game for {a mathematical formula}DO Α Β and {a mathematical formula}BI Α Β with a pure NE and both of these algorithms are able to solve the game in less than a second (0.73).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We compare all of the approximative sampling algorithms and {a mathematical formula}DO Α Β as a representative of backward induction algorithms, because it was clearly the fastest algorithm in all of the considered games.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Next, we analyze the results of the {a mathematical formula}DO Α Β algorithm compared to the sampling algorithms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The performance of the other sampling algorithms is very similar against {a mathematical formula}DO Α Β , with Exp3 winning the least in the reward optimization.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The best algorithm in this game variant is RM, which wins against all other sampling algorithms and wins most often against {a mathematical formula}DO Α Β and Exp3.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}DO Α Β wins over all other sampling algorithms.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Using the evaluation function improves the performance of all sampling algorithms against {a mathematical formula}DO Α Β and it decreases the differences in performance between each algorithm.</a>
