<a href="#0" id="0">However, waiting for a confident prediction causes delayed action selection and reduces the available time for the robot to execute its action [53].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We propose an original formulation of the action selection problem in robot table tennis as POMDPs, wherein a Monte-Carlo planning algorithm that makes use of the IDDM was presented to address the trade-off between prediction accuracy and reaction delay.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example in the case of human – robot table tennis, the robot's hitting point can usually be precisely predicted 120 ms after the human player hits the ball [53], and, thus, an optimal policy would stop waiting and initiate a hitting movement.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The optimal policy {a mathematical formula} Π ′ greedily chooses the action that maximizes the corresponding value function {a mathematical formula}Q ˆ Π .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As a stopping action terminates the decision process immediately, the value function for the stopping actions {a mathematical formula} ∀ a ∈ A ∖ {0}:Q Π ( Θ ,a)=Q( Θ ,a) holds for any belief state Θ and any policy Π .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We evaluated the LSPI and the MCP algorithms for anticipatory action selection in human – robot table tennis setup.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, the action set {a mathematical formula}A consisted of one waiting action and three stopping actions, each stopping action corresponding to a type hitting movement.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, we enforce that the robot takes a stopping action when the robot's hitting point can be reliably predicted by the vision system, which typically happens within 120 ms after the human player returns the ball [53].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this article, we introduced novel formulation and methods for anticipatory action selection for human – robot interaction, combining anticipation and planning.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this article, we motivated and evaluated the proposed framework with human – robot table tennis games, where a bottleneck is the limited amount of time for the robot to execute a hitting movement.</a>
