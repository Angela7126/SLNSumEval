<a href="#0" id="0">In order to interpret PCTL expressions over X and Y, we make the following modifications without loss of generality: Firstly, any terminal state {a mathematical formula}s¯ ∈ S¯ is an absorbing state, meaning that if a process is in {a mathematical formula}s¯, then the next state will be {a mathematical formula}s¯ with probability 1 and all players receive a zero payoff.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this regard, we note that any combination of beliefs Pr and types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ can be described as a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j ⁎ of the form{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This combination is equivalent to sampling a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j ⁎ using probabilities {a mathematical formula}Pr( Θ j ⁎ |Ht), and then using {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ to choose actions {a mathematical formula}aj ∈ Aj via {a mathematical formula} Π j(Ht,aj, Θ j ⁎ )[68].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Analogously, we may combine the true types {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ⊂ Θ j of player j, using the type distribution ϒ , into a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j+ such that{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, to simplify the notation in this section, we will generally assume a single hypothesised type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j and a single true type {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ∈ Θ j.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that this means that our method can be applied to the combination of beliefs and hypothesised types, as well as to individual types in {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
