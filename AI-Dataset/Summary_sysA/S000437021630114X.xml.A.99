<a href="#0" id="0">Our first method for image computation, {a mathematical formula}TR1+, leverages the particular structure of planning operators for faster image computation when a TR {a mathematical formula}To encodes a single operator o.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First, as all variables not appearing in the effects retain their values, the existential quantification and variable swapping only need to be applied over variables modified by {a mathematical formula}eff(o), which we call {a mathematical formula}xo.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, the bi-implication term may be omitted from {a mathematical formula}To, using instead {a mathematical formula}To ˜ , which is defined as: {a mathematical formula}To ˜ = ⋀ 〈 v,val 〉 ∈ pre(o)fBDD(v,val,x) ∧ ⋀ 〈 v,val 〉 ∈ eff(o)fBDD(v,val,x ′ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The algorithm aggregates TRs using equation (2) until a monolithic TR is created or the time and memory (in terms of BDD nodes) bounds are exceeded.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Recall that, as the cost of reaching a state must be preserved, only operators with the same cost w may be aggregated.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We do not contemplate this possibility since it would require maintaining different cBDDs, one per operator, and it cannot be combined with methods of image computation that represent multiples operators in the same TR as explained in Section 4.4.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, unlike the case of search in the original state space, {a mathematical formula}MBDD does not perform all the pruning possible.</a>
