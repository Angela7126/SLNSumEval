<a href="#0" id="0">Note also that many social properties of the ES basic fusion operator {a mathematical formula} ∇ F restricted to the triple {a mathematical formula}W ⁎ , {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ , N, are inherited from the social properties of the social choice function F. This is established in the following result.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula} Φ ↦ ⪰ Φ satisfies (B-Rep).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to do this, we consider N in {a mathematical formula}F ⁎ (S), an N-profile Φ and an epistemic state E in {a mathematical formula}E and we have to verify that {a mathematical formula} 〚 B( ∇ ( Φ ,E)) 〛 =max ⁡ ( 〚 B(E) 〛 , ⪰ Φ ).</a>
