<a href="#0" id="0">In the case of centralized optimization problems, local search techniques are used when the problems are too large to perform a complete search.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The present paper proposes a general framework for enhancing local search algorithms for DCOPs that follow the general synchronous structure with the anytime property.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the proposed framework the quality of each state is accumulated via a spanning tree of the constraint graph.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Agents receive information about the quality of the recent states of the algorithm from their children in the spanning tree, calculate the resulting quality including their own contribution according to the goal function, and pass it to their parents.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The root agent makes the final calculation of the cost of the system's state in each step and propagates down the tree the index of the step in which the system was in the most successful state.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When the search is terminated, all agents hold the assignment of the best state according to the global goal function.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our next set of experiments compared the performance of local search algorithms on sparse, unstructured random DCOPs with constraint density {a mathematical formula}p1=0.1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">10 presents the average cost in each step of the states found by the existing incomplete DCOP algorithms Max-Sum, DBA, MGM, and DSA.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The curve of the average costs for each algorithm is labeled on the right by the name of the algorithm.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We also present the average anytime costs of the best state found prior to each step for Max-Sum and DBA, as maintained by the ALS_DCOP mechanism; these are the curves labeled “ Max-Sum Anytime ” and “ DBA Anytime, ” respectively.</a>
