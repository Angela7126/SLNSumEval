<a href="#0" id="0">For an alternative {a mathematical formula}a ⁎ ∈ A and {a mathematical formula} Σ → ∈ (Sm)n, let{a mathematical formula} Given a preference profile {a mathematical formula} Σ → ∈ (Sm)n, an alternative {a mathematical formula}a ⁎ ∈ A, a vector of non-negative values {a mathematical formula}{pa}a ∈ A, and non-negative Β , define the set of inequalities {a mathematical formula}INEQ({pa}a ∈ A, Β , Σ → ,a ⁎ ) as follows:{a mathematical formula} The connection of this set of inequalities to randomized social choice functions is revealed in the following statement.A randomized social choice function f that uses probability distribution{a mathematical formula}{pa=Pr ⁡ [f( Σ → )=a]}a ∈ Afor profile{a mathematical formula} Σ → has distortion at most{a mathematical formula} Β − 1when{a mathematical formula} Β ∈ (0,1]with respect to utility profiles in{a mathematical formula}U( Σ → ,a ⁎ )if and only if the set of inequalities{a mathematical formula}INEQ({pa( Σ → )}a ∈ A, Β , Σ → ,a ⁎ )is satisfied.The fact that the distortion is at most {a mathematical formula} Β − 1 is equivalent to the following linear program having a non-negative objective value.</a>
