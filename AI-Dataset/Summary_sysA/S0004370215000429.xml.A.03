<a href="#0" id="0">A {a mathematical formula}13900 long ±1 sequence of discrepancy 3 was also constructed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A ±1 sequence of length n is a function {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,n} → { − 1,+1}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We write {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn to denote a finite ±1 sequence of length n, and {a mathematical formula}(xn) to denote an infinite sequence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then the discrepancy of a finite ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn of length n is a minimal C such that for every {a mathematical formula}d:1 ≤ d ≤ ⌊ nC+1 ⌋ the subsequence {a mathematical formula}xd,x2d … ,x ⌊ n/d ⌋ ⋅ d is C-bounded.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For the proof by contradiction, suppose that the discrepancy of some ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,x12 is 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As every ±1 sequence whose length does not exceed C is always C-bounded, in what follows we only consider cases of {a mathematical formula}l>C.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As the discrepancy of a ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn is bounded by C if, and only if, the discrepancy of {a mathematical formula} − x1, … , − xn is bounded by C, the permutation {a mathematical formula}l ↦ ¬l, where l is a literal, is a solution symmetry for the SAT encoding of the EDP.</a>
