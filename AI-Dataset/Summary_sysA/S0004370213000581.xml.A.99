<a href="#0" id="0">1 the class of instances 1 only appears in positive bags.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, it is enough to learn an instance-level classifier {a mathematical formula}f(x → ) ∈ [0,1] that provides the confidence that instance {a mathematical formula}x → belongs to class 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Once {a mathematical formula}f(x → ) has been learned, the bag-level classifier {a mathematical formula}F(X) can be simply obtained by taking the maximum over the instance-level scores: {a mathematical formula}F(X)=maxx → ∈ Xf(x → ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This way, the bag X is classified as positive if any of its instances {a mathematical formula}x → ∈ X belongs to class 1, and classified as negative otherwise.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The parameter R is optimized by maximizing the number of positive bags in the training set that contain at least one instance in R and, at the same time, the number of negative bags that do not contain any instance in R. Based on this, the bag-level classifier can be expressed by using the max rule:{a mathematical formula} i.e., X is considered positive if at least one of the instances {a mathematical formula}x → ∈ X is positive.</a>
