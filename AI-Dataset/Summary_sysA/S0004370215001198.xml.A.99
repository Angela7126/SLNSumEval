<a href="#0" id="0">Note that, for every {a mathematical formula}I ∈ In, the value of the best coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π IA is always greater than, or equal to, the average value of all coalition structures in {a mathematical formula} Π IA.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, based on Theorem 6, we obtain a lower bound on the value of the best coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π IA, which is: {a mathematical formula}LBIA= ∑ i ∈ II(i)AvgiA.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, by replacing {a mathematical formula}AvgiA with {a mathematical formula}MaxiA in this expression, we obtain an upper bound{a mathematical formula}UBIA on the value of the best coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π IA, which is: {a mathematical formula}UBIA= ∑ i ∈ II(i)MaxiA.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Using these bounds, the algorithm computes an upper bound {a mathematical formula}UB ⁎ =maxI ∈ In ⁡ UBIA and a lower bound {a mathematical formula}LB ⁎ =maxI ∈ In ⁡ LBIA on the value of the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
