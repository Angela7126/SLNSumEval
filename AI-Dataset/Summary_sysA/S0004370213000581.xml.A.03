<a href="#0" id="0">In addition to the bag-level classification function {a mathematical formula}F(X), many methods try to learn an instance-level classification function {a mathematical formula}f(x → i) that operates directly on the instances {a mathematical formula}x → i.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is an ES method where each bag X is explicitly mapped into a vector {a mathematical formula}v → .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This way, the bag X is classified as positive if any of its instances {a mathematical formula}x → ∈ X belongs to class 1, and classified as negative otherwise.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to estimate the instance-level classifier {a mathematical formula}f(x → ), the methods of this category use a training set of instances where each instance inherits the label of the bag where it lies.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The IS methods classify the bag X as positive if any of its instances belongs to {a mathematical formula}C+, so that we can express the bag-level classifier as {a mathematical formula}F(X)=[ Δ (X,C+)>0], where {a mathematical formula}[.]</a>
