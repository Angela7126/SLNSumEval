<a href="#0" id="0">Note that since the support relation {a mathematical formula}S is defined so that the source of a support link in an ASAF is an argument (by Definition 11, {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ A×(A ∪ R ∪ S)), all elements in a support sequence but the last one (i.e., the {a mathematical formula}Ai in Definition 15) will be arguments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Furthermore note that, as expressed by the condition {a mathematical formula}X ∈ (A ∪ R ∪ S) in Definition 15, this does not prevent the last element in a support sequence from being an argument as well.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a scenario where a support {a mathematical formula} Α =(A,B) holds but the chosen semantics Σ cannot determine whether the positive or the negative constraint associated with Α holds, the translation proposed in [29] is such that neither {a mathematical formula} Α + nor {a mathematical formula} Α − would belong to the corresponding extension of the associated AF under the semantics Σ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast, the translation given in Definition 23 is such that, in cases like the one mentioned above, neither {a mathematical formula} Α + nor {a mathematical formula} Α − would belong to the corresponding extension of the associated AF; notwithstanding this, argument Α would belong to that extension.</a>
