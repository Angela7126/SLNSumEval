<a href="#0" id="0">It states that an equivalence relation E is a regular equivalence with respect to a binary relation R if for {a mathematical formula}x,y ∈ U,{a mathematical formula} According to this definition, if x and y are regularly equivalent, they are connected to equivalent neighborhoods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given the basic notations of fuzzy sets and relations, a weighted social network can be defined as a structure {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i ∈ I,(Rj)j ∈ J), where U is a finite set of actors; {a mathematical formula}Pi is a fuzzy subset of U for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ I; and {a mathematical formula}Rj is a fuzzy relation on U for all {a mathematical formula}j ∈ J.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, the similarity relation{a mathematical formula} satisfies{a mathematical formula} Thus, S is a regular similarity of {a mathematical formula}N because the set of attributes is empty.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, by Corollary 1, {a mathematical formula}G( □ , ◇ )-equivalence is equal to the 1-cut of the maximum regular similarity, which is not necessarily a GRE, as shown in Example 1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, because the number of formulas of a logical language is infinite in general, the direct computation of the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation is not effective.</a>
