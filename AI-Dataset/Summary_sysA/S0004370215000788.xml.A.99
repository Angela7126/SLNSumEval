<a href="#0" id="0">It is not feasible for us to compute the best solution given the problem size.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, we obtain a lower bound on the optimal solution as follows: given a set of items, we generate 5000 random orderings, and we use the true model (i.e., the simulator) to evaluate them and pick the one returning the highest revenue.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition, we investigate the scalability of our approach using the following experiments: (1) first, we test the small instances to show how close the orderings found by the learned models are to the actual optimum; (2) second, we generate a randomized population of bidders to test whether our method can handle the cases where the bidders in different auction vary a lot; (3) third, we use a larger set of items and item types to demonstrate how well our approach can be expected to perform in larger auctions with many more items of greater diversity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The figure demonstrates that the linear regression based optimization methods return more reliable solutions, i.e., their solutions evaluated on the learned linear models are closer to the solution values returned by the simulator.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this case, a major hurdle will be to find a representation that results in Markovian states, which is needed to apply the dynamic programming methods.</a>
