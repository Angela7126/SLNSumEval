<a href="#2" id="2">The action which ag wants to result from performing Α is {a mathematical formula}j0.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}prob(j0) be the probability of {a mathematical formula}j0 being the joint action performed when ag performs Α in {a mathematical formula}qs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Joint Action Premise: {a mathematical formula}{j0,j1,...jn} is the set of joint actions in which ag performs Α .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Expected Utility Premise: {a mathematical formula}euag( Α ,prob(j0)) returns the expected utilities of agent ag performing Α for values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j0) where {a mathematical formula}j0 is the desired joint action.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The first premise identifies the values that the agent will consider and the second weights them in terms of the most important value.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The joint actions containing the advocated action Α as the action of ag are then taken from the AATS+V to give the third premise.</a>
