<a href="#0" id="0">Consider an epistemic scenario wherein the agents are not only uncertain about the factual state of the world but also about the protocol that can be executed given some factual state, depicted as the model:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From Proposition 18, according to the protocol Η , the expected observations on a state s in an epistemic model {a mathematical formula}M can be computed by {a mathematical formula}fVM(s)( Η ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given an epistemic expectation model{a mathematical formula}M=(N,Exp), there is an epistemic model{a mathematical formula}N ′ and an epistemic protocol model{a mathematical formula}Asuch that{a mathematical formula}M ↔ ̲ oN ′ ⊗ A.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Here, {a mathematical formula}Ae ′ ′ is the corresponding epistemic protocol modelled on p. 27:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To this end we first introduce fact-changing epistemic expectation models and protocol models, {a mathematical formula}MexpF and {a mathematical formula}AF, given by {a mathematical formula} 〈 Mexp,F 〉 and {a mathematical formula} 〈 A,F 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}Mexp is an epistemic expectation model, {a mathematical formula}A is a protocol model and {a mathematical formula}F is a factual change system.</a>
