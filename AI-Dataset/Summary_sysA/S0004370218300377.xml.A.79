<a href="#0" id="0">Precisely, if {a mathematical formula}a=gr( Α ), it follows from the definition of {a mathematical formula}a Γ (see Remark 15) that:{a mathematical formula} Considering that, by Proposition 16, a is strongly Γ -safe if and only if {a mathematical formula}a Γ is also strongly Γ -safe, the property of strong safety of an action schema Α does not depend on the formulas in Α that do not match {a mathematical formula}T. Hence, in principle, such a property should be analysed by studying the restrictions of Α to the different {a mathematical formula}T-classes L of matching formulas.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We can estimate this term with the product {a mathematical formula} Ω ⋅ |C| where Ω is the maximum number of formulas in any schema that shares the same relation and {a mathematical formula}|C| is the cardinality of the template's component set {a mathematical formula}C. We deduce that all safety checks for individual schemas (both the instantaneous and the durative ones) have a computational complexity of the order of {a mathematical formula}M ⋅ |A| ⋅ Ω ⋅ |C|, where M is the maximum number of formulas appearing in any schema and {a mathematical formula}|A| is the total number of schemas.</a>
