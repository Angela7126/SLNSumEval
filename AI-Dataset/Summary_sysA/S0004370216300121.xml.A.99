<a href="#0" id="0">Then, there are variables {a mathematical formula}y,z ∈ X ∖ {x} such that {a mathematical formula} 〈 a,s(y) 〉 ∉ Rxy and {a mathematical formula} 〈 b,s(z) 〉 ∉ Rxz.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By definition of the merging of {a mathematical formula}a,b to produce c, and since s is a solution to {a mathematical formula}I ′ containing {a mathematical formula} 〈 x,c 〉 , we must have {a mathematical formula}(b,s(y)) ∈ Rxy and {a mathematical formula}(a,s(z)) ∈ Rxz.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, {a mathematical formula}(s(y),s(z)) ∈ Ryz since s is a solution to {a mathematical formula}I ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence, {a mathematical formula} 〈 y,s(y) 〉 , {a mathematical formula} 〈 z,s(z) 〉 , {a mathematical formula} 〈 x,a 〉 , {a mathematical formula} 〈 x,b 〉 forms a broken-triangle, which contradicts our assumption.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, the absence of broken triangles on assignments {a mathematical formula} 〈 x,a 〉 , {a mathematical formula} 〈 x,b 〉 allows us to merge these assignments while preserving satisfiability.Reconstructing a solution to I from a solution s to {a mathematical formula}I ′ simply requires checking which of {a mathematical formula}sa or {a mathematical formula}sb is a solution to I.</a>
