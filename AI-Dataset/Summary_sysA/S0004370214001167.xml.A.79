<a href="#0" id="0">The function g for a model {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}OP can be constructed as in the proof of Theorem 12, with the exception that we define as {a mathematical formula}g( Ν i) that element {a mathematical formula}y ∈ Δ I whose existence is guaranteed by {a mathematical formula}OP, ⇝ → when we consider {a mathematical formula}x=g( Ν ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The undecidability results for consistency of classical ontologies (the first row of Table 5) immediately carry over to this problem since the reduction uses only one individual name and consistency of a finite set {a mathematical formula}O of GCIs together with the crisp assertions {a mathematical formula} 〈 e0:C1 〉 , … , {a mathematical formula} 〈 e0:Cn 〉 is equivalent to the 1-satisfiability of the concept {a mathematical formula}C1 ⊓ ⋯ ⊓ Cn w.r.t.</a>
