<a href="#0" id="0">The relevance of I, denoted as {a mathematical formula}R(I), is the fraction of joint value assignments i in {a mathematical formula} Ω (I ∖ {I}) for which {a mathematical formula}argmaxhPr(h,e,i,i) is not identical for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ Ω (I).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As computing the relevance of a variable I is {a mathematical formula}NP-hard, i.e., intractable in general (see Appendix A for a formal proof), we introduce the notion estimated relevance of I as a subjective assessment of {a mathematical formula}R(I) which may or may not correspond to the actual value.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the previous subsections we showed that MFE is intractable in general, both to compute exactly and to approximate, yet can be tractably approximated (with a so-called expectation – approximation [42]) when the treewidth of the network is low, the cardinality of the variables is small, the number of relevant intermediate variables is low, and the probability distribution for a given explanation set H, evidence e and relevant intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I+ is fairly decisive, i.e., skewed towards a single MFE explanation.</a>
