<a href="#0" id="0">For any representation C of f, the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I= Φ − 1(C) must be a model of T. If I is distinct from {a mathematical formula}I ⁎ , it cannot be a model of {a mathematical formula}T ∧ K, and hence, C must be a proper subset of {a mathematical formula}C ′ =satK(C).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For this saturated network {a mathematical formula}C ′ , we know that {a mathematical formula}I ′ = Φ − 1(C ′ ) is a model of K. Since, in addition, K is a set of correct rules for B, {a mathematical formula}C ′ is a representation of f, which implies that {a mathematical formula}I ′ is also a model of T. Consequently, {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ T ∧ K, implying that {a mathematical formula}I ′ =I ⁎ by unique satisfiability of {a mathematical formula}T ∧ K, which in turn implies that {a mathematical formula}f=f ⁎ .</a>
