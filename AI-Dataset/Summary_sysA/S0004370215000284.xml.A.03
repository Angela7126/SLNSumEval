<a href="#0" id="0">The robot starts without any knowledge of the available actions and it has to request demonstrations from a teacher whenever new actions are required to complete a task.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In summary, we propose a RL algorithm that can request demonstrations from a teacher whenever it requires new unknown actions to complete a task, which significantly reduces the number of experiences required to learn.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These domains are described using a vocabulary of predicates P and actions A, and a set of objects {a mathematical formula}C Î  .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}ar is the action that the rule represents.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When the action {a mathematical formula}ar is executed, only the rule r with preconditions present in the state will be applicable.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, actions do not have to be defined in advance, but the system will request demonstrations from the teacher when they are needed if unknown actions are required during the execution.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The REX-D algorithm requests demonstrations from the teacher whenever it does not know how to complete the task.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, if no guidance is provided, the teacher may demonstrate actions that the system already knows before demonstrating the action that is actually required.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, the teacher may be asked to perform an action that has to be executed after executing other actions that the system already knows.</a>
