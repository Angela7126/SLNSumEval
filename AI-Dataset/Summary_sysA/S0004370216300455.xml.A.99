<a href="#0" id="0">We stress that default negation and epistemic negation are used to minimize the knowledge at the answer set level and the world view level, respectively, and the notion of positive knowledge to be minimized at the answer set level is different from that at the world view level.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">At the answer set level, where default negation ¬ is used, any ground atom is the positive knowledge to be minimized in answer sets; but at the world view level, where epistemic negation not is used, any closed (first-order) formula is the positive knowledge to be minimized in world views.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Specifically, at the answer set level, for any ground atom A we assume its default negation ¬A to be true in every answer set whenever possible (knowledge minimization with default negation); analogously at the world view level, for any closed formula F we assume its epistemic negation notF occurring in a logic program to be true in every world view whenever possible (knowledge minimization with epistemic negation).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a result, by applying default negation we minimize the knowledge in every answer set, and by applying epistemic negation we minimize the knowledge in every world view.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since epistemic negation is at a meta level, in our approach the minimization with epistemic negation has higher priority and is done before the minimization with default negation.Note that if one intends to apply epistemic negation to a formula F by assuming notF to be true in every world view whenever possible, one must explicitly express the epistemic negation notF in a logic program.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus the following four programs{a mathematical formula} are entirely different and have different world views: {a mathematical formula} Π 1 has a unique world view {a mathematical formula}{{p}{q}}, {a mathematical formula} Π 2 has a unique one {a mathematical formula}{{p}}, {a mathematical formula} Π 3 has a unique one {a mathematical formula}{{q}}, and {a mathematical formula} Π 4 has two world views {a mathematical formula}{{p}} and {a mathematical formula}{{q}}.In contrast, for any ground atom A its default negation ¬A is implicitly assumed to be true in every answer set whenever possible, whether or not ¬A is present in a logic program.</a>
