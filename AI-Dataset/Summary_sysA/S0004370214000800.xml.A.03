<a href="#0" id="0">One straightforward approach to OTL is based on a continuous learning strategy, which initializes a regular online learning algorithm on the target domain with the existing classifier learnt from source domains.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The goal of an online transfer learning (OTL) task is to learn some prediction function {a mathematical formula}f(xt) on a target domain in an online fashion from a sequence of examples {a mathematical formula}{(xt,yt)|t=1, … ,T} in some data space {a mathematical formula}X×Y.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to perform effective transfer for the subsequent trials of the OTL task, in addition to updating the function {a mathematical formula}wt+1 by some online learning method, e.g.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By this proposition, we summarize the proposed “ Heterogeneous Online Transfer Learning ” (HetOTL) algorithm in Algorithm 3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, Algorithm 4 summarizes the proposed Concept Drift Online Learning (CDOL) algorithm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">First of all, it is clear that the proposed two online transfer learning algorithms are significantly more effective than the other algorithms for most cases.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This validates the proposed OTL technique is effective for knowledge transfer in the online learning tasks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">4 evaluates the online prediction performance of different algorithms with varied values of parameter C across all the heterogeneous learning tasks.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This paper presented a novel framework of Online Transfer Learning (OTL), which aims to attack an online learning task on a target domain by transferring knowledge from a source domain.</a>
