<a href="#0" id="0">We now look at the problem of deciding whether a given DL-program {a mathematical formula} Π = 〈 O,P 〉 has an x-(repair) answer set for {a mathematical formula}x ∈ {flp,weak}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Table 1 compactly summarizes our complexity results for this problem for {a mathematical formula}O in {a mathematical formula}DL-LiteA.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">the ontology {a mathematical formula}O ′ = 〈 T,A ′ 〉 is consistent;</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider {a mathematical formula}R= 〈 O,D1,D2 〉 with {a mathematical formula}O as in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">1, and the following sets {a mathematical formula}D1 and {a mathematical formula}D2:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the following grounding of some rules from Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">1:{a mathematical formula} The replacement program {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ ′ for {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 O,P ′ 〉 comprises the following rules:{a mathematical formula} where{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}A ′ determines whether a deletion repair answer set has been found.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As we show, Algorithm SupRAnsSet correctly computes the deletion repair answer sets of the input DL-program.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For the completeness part, i.e., that all deletion repair answer sets are indeed produced, the following proposition is crucial.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Given a DL-program Π , let{a mathematical formula}I ˆ be an answer set of{a mathematical formula} Π ˆ such that{a mathematical formula}I=I ˆ | Π is an answer set of{a mathematical formula} Π = 〈 T,A,P 〉 .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If{a mathematical formula}I ˆ is a compatible set for{a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T,A ′ ,P 〉 where{a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊇ A, then I is an answer set for{a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T,A ′ ,P 〉 .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">computing deletion repair answer sets, i.e., given a DL-program{a mathematical formula} Π = 〈 O,P 〉 with{a mathematical formula}DL-LiteAontology{a mathematical formula}O,{a mathematical formula}SupRAnsSet( Π )correctly outputs all deletion repair answer sets of Π .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">One can see that the repair computation is slower then the standard answer set computation, which is more obvious for {a mathematical formula}T5000; This is due to the construction of support sets and their exploitation in the declarative approach for repair answer set computation.</a>
