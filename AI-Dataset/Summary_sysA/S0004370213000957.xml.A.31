<a href="#1" id="1">This shows that {a mathematical formula}G Ξ M – the two-valued operator associated to the reduced ADF {a mathematical formula} Ξ M – is in some sense “ complete ” with respect to the result of {a mathematical formula}G Ξ ′ ( ⋅ ,M) – the operator for checking whether M is a two-valued stable model of Ξ .</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula} Ξ =(S,L,Cin) be an abstract dialectical framework.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A set {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ S is a stable model of Ξ iff it is the unique least model of the reduced ADF {a mathematical formula} Ξ M=(S,L,CMin) with{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As another consequence of the proof of Lemma 3.16, we can also show that LP-based ADFs are sound with respect to two-valued stable models of the LP, that is, any stable model of {a mathematical formula} Ξ ( Π ) is a stable model of Π .</a>
