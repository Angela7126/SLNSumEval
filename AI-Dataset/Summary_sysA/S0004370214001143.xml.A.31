<a href="#0" id="0">Teaching guidance has more impact on longer teaching sequences.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As with the algorithmic teaching guidance in Experiment 1, we observe that heuristic teaching guidance is more effective in getting humans to provide more useful examples in the sub-condition with {a mathematical formula}r=8, where the optimal teaching sequence is longer (Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">6).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, we do not see improvements in terms of the time used or the number of questions asked to the learner.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">On the contrary, we see that participants spent slightly more time and asked more questions than in the Natural condition when {a mathematical formula}r=8 (Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">7: Right).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This can be attributed to the aforementioned problems encountered by participants in following heuristic teaching guidance.</a>
