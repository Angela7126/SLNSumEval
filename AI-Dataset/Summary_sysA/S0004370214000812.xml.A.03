<a href="#0" id="0">Said more intuitively, once the nodes in the most influential set S follow the behavior {a mathematical formula}xS prescribed to them by a desired stable outcome x achieving the goal of interest, they become collectively “ so influential ” that their behavior “ forces ” every other individual to a unique choice of behavior!</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, {a mathematical formula}xi ∈ { − 1,1} denotes the behavior of individual i, where {a mathematical formula}xi=1 indicates that i “ adopts ” a particular behavior and {a mathematical formula}xi= − 1 indicates i “ does not adopt ” the behavior.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We denote the set of all PSNE of the game {a mathematical formula}G by{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} Therefore, we can construct an LIG that has exactly the same set of PSNE as the polymatrix game, in the following way.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}E0 is the only PSNE in J with the k extra players playing 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note however that this adaptation is exclusive to a very specific instance of our general problem formulation: identifying “ most influential nodes ” with respect to the goal being maximizing the number of +1's in the PSNE (see Definition 3.6 in Section 3.2 for a definition and discussion of our problem formulation and the role that the “ objective function ” {a mathematical formula}g(.)</a>
