<a href="#0" id="0">Our main technical contribution is to propose polynomial time algorithms to compute the Semivalue-based betweenness centrality measure, and an even faster algorithm to compute the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure, both for weighted and unweighted networks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Interestingly, as shown in Table 1, for the unweighted case our algorithm for computing the Shapley value-based centrality has the same complexity as the best known algorithm for computing the standard betweenness centrality, due to Brandes [15].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, both algorithms run in {a mathematical formula}O(|V||E|) time, where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges in the network.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measureGiven a network {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E), the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality of node {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V(G) is defined as the function {a mathematical formula}cSh:V → R such that:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Ν :2V(G) → R is defined for every subset of nodes, {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ V(G), as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to compute the standard betweenness centrality measure for all nodes, a naïve algorithm would first compute the number of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, and then for each node v sum up all pair-dependencies, which are defined as {a mathematical formula} Σ st(v) Σ st.</a>
