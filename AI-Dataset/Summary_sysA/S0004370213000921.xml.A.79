<a href="#0" id="0">In the greedy mode, the pickVar functions prefer variables whose flips can decrease the number of falsified clauses (or the total weight of falsified clauses in clause weighting SLS algorithms); in the diversification mode, they tend to better explore the search space and avoid local optima, usually using randomized strategies and exploiting diversification properties of variables such as age and flip count to pick a variable for this aim.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">More importantly, we propose a new variable property called subscore, and utilize it to break ties in CCApaws, resulting in the algorithm CCAsubscore, which proves very efficient for random k-SAT with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A recent local search solver called FrwCB can solve random 3-SAT instances at {a mathematical formula}r=4.2 with up to 4 million variables within reasonable time, but its performance on those with ratio 4.267 is worse than that of CCASat [30].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The Survey Propagation (SP) algorithm [7], which is extremely good at solving random 3-SAT instances, can solve random 3-SAT instances at {a mathematical formula}r=4.2 with up to 10 million variables [35], but it fails to converge on those with ratio up to 4.267, or before that [7].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this naive implementation, the CC strategy needs {a mathematical formula}O( Δ (F)) for both storing and checking the configuration for a variable.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, the worst complexity per step for the CC strategy under the naive implementation (which needs to check the configuration for the candidate variables and store the configuration for the flipped variable) is {a mathematical formula}O( Δ (F)n)+O( Δ (F))=O( Δ (F)n).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">According to the above proposition, in order to make a random 3-SAT formula be evaluated true, at least half of the clauses ({a mathematical formula}(2 − 32)m=m2) should be critical, i.e., having only one true literal.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As for future work, we would like to design more sophisticated variable property and scoring functions related to subscore, which we believe can further improve the state of the art in SLS algorithms for SAT, especially for random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
