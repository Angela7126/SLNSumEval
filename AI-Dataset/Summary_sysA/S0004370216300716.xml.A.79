<a href="#0" id="0">The hypergraph does not depend on which vertices have property p in the original SN, but depends only on Π and the structure of {a mathematical formula}S in terms of edges and vertex properties other than p. Therefore, given a GAP Π and an SN{a mathematical formula}S, the diffusion hypergraph has to be computed only once and can be used with different assignments of a property p to the vertices of{a mathematical formula}S. This allows us to save time in computing diffusion centrality which requires computing the least fixed point for different initial assignments of p. However, if the SN changes, the diffusion hypergraph needs to be recomputed.</a>
