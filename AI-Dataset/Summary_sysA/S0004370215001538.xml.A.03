<a href="#0" id="0">Nonetheless, there are many other human intelligence tests and cognitive tests that also measure intelligence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Extending the parallel from the history of general game playing to computer models solving intelligence tests, the composition of an inventory of problems and the proposal of some criteria to compare the different systems is a crucial step.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In other words, these cognitive approaches are not meant to build systems that are able to perform well (or perfectly) in some tasks (or even in intelligence test problems), but rather that perform in the same way humans do, solving problems that humans usually solve but also failing at problems where humans fail.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We refer to some of these tests as ‘ similar ’ to intelligence test because those tests do not originate from psychometrics but from AI or cognitive science, and have never been used to evaluate humans systematically.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">So, the second question (Q2) is: How challenging are intelligence test problems for AI and what are the challenges?</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In particular, the third question (Q3) is: Are computer models for solving intelligence test problems useful for understanding human cognition?</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Second, many of these intelligence test problems have been developed for humans, and hence it can be unfair to evaluate AI systems limitations with anthropocentric measures.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In fact, focussing on the most difficult problems may even make the system more specialised to the intelligence test task at hand.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">There seems to be broad interest in computer models solving intelligence tests in all three disciplines if we look at the column ‘ intention ’ in Table 4.</a>
