<a href="#0" id="0">We say that l is strictly derived from X wrt K, denoted by {a mathematical formula}X ⊢ Kl, iff {a mathematical formula}l ∈ X or l is the conclusion of an argument constructed according to Definition 2 where in step 1 only elements from {a mathematical formula}Xdom are used and in step 2, only the strict rules from K are used.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The normal attack relation assignment{a mathematical formula}attsnr is defined by: For any knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ R and any arguments {a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ ARK, {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ attsnr(K) if and only if A undercuts B or A normal-rebuts B.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is clear that assertion (2) follows immediately from assertion (1) and the definition of {a mathematical formula}AttR.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We hence need only to prove assertion (1).Let E be a stable extension of {a mathematical formula}(ARK,atts(K)).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From Lemma 2, Lemma 16, it is clear that E is also conflict-free wrt {a mathematical formula}atts ′ (K).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As E attacks each argument in {a mathematical formula}ARK ∖ E wrt {a mathematical formula}atts(K) and {a mathematical formula}atts(K) ⊆ atts ′ (K), it is obvious that E attacks each argument in {a mathematical formula}ARK ∖ E wrt {a mathematical formula}atts ′ (K).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">E is hence stable wrt {a mathematical formula}atts ′ (K).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For extended rule-based systems, we define normal attack relation assignments in the same way as before, namely, for any extended knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ ER and any arguments {a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ ARK, {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ attsenr(K) if and only if A undercuts or undermines B or A normal-rebuts B where the definition of normal-rebuts is the same like in section 5.2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Suppose every attack relation assignment {a mathematical formula}atts ∈ A satisfies the inconsistency-resolving property.</a>
