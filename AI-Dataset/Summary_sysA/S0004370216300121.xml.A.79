<a href="#0" id="0">If the constraints are represented by nogoods, as in our Definition 2, then to decide whether there is a GABT on {a mathematical formula}a,b in a CSP instance, one can use the second condition in Definition 11 and explore all pairs {a mathematical formula}t ∪ { 〈 x,b 〉 },u ∪ { 〈 x,a 〉 } ∈ NoGoods(I).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the other hand, if the constraints are represented as lists of allowed tuples, then one can use the first condition in Definition 11 and explore all pairs {a mathematical formula}t ∪ { 〈 x,a 〉 },u ∪ { 〈 x,b 〉 } of tuples explicitly allowed by the constraints in I (since the second condition implies that under this representation, there is a constraint over the variables of t and x, and one over the variables of u and x).</a>
