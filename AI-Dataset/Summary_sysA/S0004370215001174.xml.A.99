<a href="#0" id="0">RoCKIn@Home is the most similar competition to RoboCup@Home, and its significant focus on benchmarking, that includes a different evaluation methodology and a deeper analysis of the interaction between functionalities and tasks, is certainly of great interest to RoboCup@Home.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As discussed further in Section 6.2, the ideas of multiple repetitions of a test for better statistical analysis and a new scoring system for a detailed analysis of the relation between functionality and task performance come directly from observations of the RoCKIn@Home competition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the design of the tests and in the analysis of the results, we consider the above overall goal of RoboCup@Home and the conventions limiting the difficulties of the environment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, advances of RoboCup@Home are measured in terms of the effectiveness of the robotic systems (tested during the competition) in performing tasks and services that are relevant for helping non-expert users in daily activities in a domestic scenario, taking into account the discussed limitations of the difficulty of the environment.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Person Tracking difficulty was increased in 2012 by increasing the amount of background noise in the ‘ Follow me ’ test, allowing many people within the area were the test was performed, thus increasing the difficulty for the robot to track the walker.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As a final remark on the developed analysis, we want to highlight that in the development of integrated research in AI and robotics, a good balance of all the functionalities is required.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Naturally, we focus on the top performing teams as well as on the teams that successfully demonstrated a particularly interesting approach or a very robust approach for a particular skill.</a>
