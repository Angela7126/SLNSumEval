<a href="#0" id="0">Nevertheless, since there does not exist a similarity measure works better than all the other ones in every scenario, an alignment system typically calculates the similarity between a pair of entities from two different ontologies by means of a set of multiple similarity techniques, and the obtained similarity values are combined in a unique similarity measure.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, all the aforementioned approaches are not able to determine a universal weight configuration that can be used for different ontology pairs without adjustment, and the quality measures used by them more or less require the involvement of the domain experts, and the shortcomings of f-measure are not considered in the process of tuning the meta-matching system.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since the application of a single similarity measure is often not enough to produce an acceptable output alignment, the common strategy is to combine different similarity measures to compute a unique confidence value as an aggregated similarity value.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, a novel approach based on MA using both MatchFmeasure and UIR has been proposed to aggregate different similarity measures into a single metric, and optimize the quality of multiple ontology alignments simultaneously without using reference alignment.</a>
