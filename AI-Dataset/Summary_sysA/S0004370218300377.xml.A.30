<a href="#0" id="0">For a state s and an action set A, we have that {a mathematical formula}s ∈ SA if and only if {a mathematical formula}s Γ ∈ SA Γ and {a mathematical formula}s¬ Γ ∈ SA¬ Γ and it holds that:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}A Γ is strongly Γ -safe;</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For a template {a mathematical formula}T, a set of actions {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ GA is strongly safe if it is strongly Γ -safe for every instance Γ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We now fix a template {a mathematical formula}T and an instance Γ and give the following natural definition of safety for a sequence.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A sequence of action sets A is safe for a template {a mathematical formula}T if it is Γ -safe for every instance Γ of {a mathematical formula}T. A sequence of action sets A is strongly safe for a template {a mathematical formula}T if it is strongly Γ -safe for every instance Γ of {a mathematical formula}T. It is weakly safe if it is safe but not strongly safe.</a>
