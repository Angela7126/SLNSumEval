<a href="#0" id="0">According to the definition, an abstraction pattern is defined over a fixed set of evidence findings {a mathematical formula}MP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}Q be a set of observables and {a mathematical formula}G a set of abstraction grammars.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given an interpretation problem IP and an abstraction hypothesis {a mathematical formula} Ħ = 〈 oh,P, ↢ 〉 , we define the following sets of observations:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given an interpretation problem IP, an interpretation is defined as a set of abstraction hypotheses {a mathematical formula}I={ Ħ 1, … , Ħ m}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since each abstraction hypothesis involves a different abstraction pattern there are no alternative hypotheses in any interpretation of {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S).Suppose there is a set covering {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ S of U of size k or less.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The result of ABDUCE() is a set of interpretations {a mathematical formula}I ′ , each one adding a new abstraction hypothesis with respect to the parent interpretation I.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let us consider the interpretation problem set out in Example 5.1 and the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I0 shown in Fig.</a>
