<a href="#0" id="0">Second, SSTF constructs the i-th augmented tensor {a mathematical formula}Rv(i) by inserting entries for relationships composed of users, classes of sparse items in {a mathematical formula}Vs(i), and tags into the original tensor {a mathematical formula}R as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}f(vs) is a function that returns the classes of item {a mathematical formula}vs, {a mathematical formula}Sv(i)=| ⋃ Vs(i)f(vs)| is the number of classes that have the i-th most sparse items, and {a mathematical formula}s(j − N)v is a class of sparse item {a mathematical formula}vs where {a mathematical formula}(j − N) represents the identifier of the class ({a mathematical formula}1 ≤ (j − N) ≤ Sv(i)).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">SSTF updates the feature vector for item {a mathematical formula}vn, {a mathematical formula}vn, to an updated one, {a mathematical formula}vn ′ , by incorporating the set of semantically biased feature vectors for {a mathematical formula}vn's classes, {a mathematical formula}{c(N+j)v(i)}j, as semantic biases into {a mathematical formula}vn.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is done by iterating the following equation from {a mathematical formula}i=1 to {a mathematical formula}i=X:{a mathematical formula} Here, {a mathematical formula} Ε (i)(0 ≤ Ε (i) ≤ 1) is a parameter that determines how strongly the semantic biases are to be applied to {a mathematical formula}vn.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, equation (2) returns a vector {a mathematical formula}vn ′ that combines feature vector {a mathematical formula}vn and the set of semantically biased feature vectors for {a mathematical formula}vn's classes, {a mathematical formula}{c(N+j)v(i)}j, according to the degree of sparsity of item {a mathematical formula}vn if {a mathematical formula}vn is a sparse item.</a>
