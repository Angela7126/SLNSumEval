<a href="#0" id="0">We denote a set of equivalence constraints on a variable X by {a mathematical formula}CX.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This dataset also respects the equivalence constraint {a mathematical formula}CT={1,2,3}, as all three examples observe the same value true on the variable T.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is, we have the set of equivalence constraints {a mathematical formula}C={CA} where {a mathematical formula}CA={C1,C2}={{1,2},{3,4}}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that a given equivalence constraint {a mathematical formula}CX is independent of all other equivalence constraints (and further, the network parameters Î˜ ), given the variables {a mathematical formula}XC, which follows from d-separation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By asserting the equivalence constraints {a mathematical formula}C in our meta-network, we introduce complexity to its topology, which can make evaluating the constrained likelihood an intractable inference problem.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Computing the constrained log likelihood is challenging because of the equivalence constraints {a mathematical formula}C that we assert in our meta-network, which may make the topology of the meta-network too complex for exact inference algorithms.</a>
