<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula} Ω i be the set of the first i diagnoses returned by the DA, and let {a mathematical formula}Hi to be the health state generated from the diagnoses in {a mathematical formula} Ω i.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The first clear trend we observe in these results is that it is possible to converge to a Ε -stable health state without finding all diagnoses even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The wasted effort cost for the health state generated from all diagnoses (the {a mathematical formula} Ε =0 line) is 0.18.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Now consider the health state for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The health state generated from the diagnoses found until convergence according to the Euclidean distance has a wasted effort cost of 0.44 – much worse than the 0.18 for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is especially surprising, since the convergence rate for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.5 is 0.08, i.e., only 8% of the diagnoses are needed to create a health state that has only 0.01 more wasted effort cost than the health state generated by all diagnoses.</a>
