<a href="#0" id="0">In particular, the relation:{a mathematical formula} is rewritten as:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} performing the usual eliminations we have the following inequality that no longer depends on Ω :{a mathematical formula} This is a very important result and it is equivalent to say that in a periodic schedule, if the (modular) precedence constraints are satisfied for iteration 0, then they are satisfied for every other iteration.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to model a temporal dependency {a mathematical formula} 〈 i,j, Θ (i,j), Δ (i,j) 〉 we have implemented a modular precedence constraint (ModPC), with the following signature:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}ei,sj, Η i, Β j, Λ are the variables representing the end time of activity i, the start time of activity j, their respective iteration numbers and the period.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The filtering rules for the iteration variables, which updates the bounds of the {a mathematical formula} Η i and {a mathematical formula} Β j variables so that a proper distance (in terms of number of iterations) exists between activity i and j.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An evaluation of the solution quality obtained by the {a mathematical formula}CROSS ⁎ approach: the second group of tests is performed on a set of synthetic instances and compares the best solution obtained by {a mathematical formula}CROSS ⁎ (within 300 s) with a lower bound on the instance period (namely, the iteration bound from Section 2.3.1).</a>
