<a href="#0" id="0">In the same community, Howe and co-authors [45], [97] used linear regression to predict how both a planner ʼ s runtime and its probability of success depend on various features of the planning problem; they also applied these predictions to decide, on a per-instance basis, which of a finite set of algorithms should be run in order to optimize a performance objective such as expected runtime.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">More specifically, we show how to extend all models to handle categorical inputs (required for predictions in partially categorical configuration spaces) and describe two new model families well-suited to modelling the performance of highly parameterized algorithms based on potentially large amounts of data: the projected process approximation to Gaussian processes and random forests of regression trees.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For some applications such expensive features will be reasonable — in particular, we note that for applications that take features as a one-time input, but build models repeatedly, it can even make sense to use features whose cost exceeds that of solving the instance; examples of such applications include model-based algorithm configuration [55] and complex empirical analyses based on performance predictions [53], [57].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We showed that our new approaches — chiefly those based on random forests, but also approximate Gaussian processes — offer the best performance, whether we consider predictions for previously unseen problem instances for parameterless algorithms, new parameter settings for a parameterized algorithm running on a single problem instance, or parameterized algorithms being run both with new parameter values and on previously unseen problem instances.</a>
