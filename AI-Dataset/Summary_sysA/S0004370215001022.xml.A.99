<a href="#0" id="0">Given a symmetric similarity matrix W over a set V of data points (recall Section 2.1), the basic idea behind all of our MaxSAT formulations of correlation clustering is that hard clauses are used to enforce that any solution to the MaxSAT instance represents a well-defined clustering (i.e., a mapping {a mathematical formula}cl:V → N).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a similarity matrix W over a set of data points {a mathematical formula}V={v1, … ,vN}, minimizing disagreements refers to minimizing the number of point pairs {a mathematical formula}vi, {a mathematical formula}vj whose cluster assignment does not agree with their similarity value {a mathematical formula}W(i,j), or more precisely, to finding a clustering cl minimizing{a mathematical formula} Maximizing agreements refers to maximizing the number of pairs of points {a mathematical formula}vi, {a mathematical formula}vj whose cluster assignment agrees with their similarity value {a mathematical formula}W(i,j), or more precisely, to finding a clustering cl maximizing{a mathematical formula} Maximizing correlation refers to maximizing the difference between agreements and disagreements, i.e., using the objective function obtained by substracting Equation (7) from Equation (8).</a>
