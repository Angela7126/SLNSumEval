<a href="#0" id="0">The 2014 UT Austin Villa team introduced an extensive layered learning approach to learn skills for the robot such as getting up, walking, and kicking.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">GetUp_Front_Behavior and GetUp_Back_Behavior are overlapping layered learning behaviors as they contain the same parameters as the previously learned GetUp_Front_Primitive and GetUp_Back_Primitive behaviors respectively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The full kick behaviors are overlapping layered learning behaviors because they re-optimize previous learned parameters.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The above overlapping layered approach of first independently learning the walk approach and kick, and then learning the two position parameters, does better than both the sequential layered learning approach where all kick parameters are learned after freezing the approach, and the concurrent layered learning approach where both approach and kick parameters are learned simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To isolate the performance of kicking learned through an overlapping layered learning approach we disable all kicking (except for on kickoffs where we once again have a robot kick the ball as far as possible toward the opponent's goal without scoring) and used an “ always dribble ” behavior.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We applied our overlapping layered learning approach for learning behaviors to each of the available robot types.</a>
