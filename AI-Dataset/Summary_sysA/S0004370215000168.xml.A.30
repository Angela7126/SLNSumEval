<a href="#0" id="0">To better exploit the (multi-period) mean reversion property, we proposed a new type of algorithm, named On-Line Moving Average Reversion (OLMAR), for on-line portfolio selection.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The essential idea is to exploit multi-period moving average (mean) reversion via powerful online machine learning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Rather than {a mathematical formula}p ˜ t+1=pt − 1, OLMAR assumes that next price will revert to a Moving Average (MA), that is, {a mathematical formula}p ˜ t+1=MAt, where {a mathematical formula}MAt denotes the Moving Average (MA) at the end of tth period.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In time series analysis, MA is typically used to smooth short-term price fluctuations and focuses on long-term trends.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus it can solve the two drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The proposed formulation, OLMAR, is to exploit moving average reversion via online learning techniques [38].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The basic idea is to maximize the expected return {a mathematical formula}b ⋅ x ˜ t+1, and keep last portfolio information via a regularization term, using the online passive – aggressive learning method [17].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">To this end, we can design the proposed algorithms based on the propositions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The on-line portfolio selection procedure is illustrated in Algorithm 2, and the proposed OLMAR procedures are illustrated in Algorithm 3.</a>
