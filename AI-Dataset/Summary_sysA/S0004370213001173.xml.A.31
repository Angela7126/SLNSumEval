<a href="#1" id="1">Regardless of the actor Ê¼ s internal architecture, it will view, prepare, and carry out its actions hierarchically.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each action in a plan may be a task that may need further refinement and planning, which will usually be done online (see below) and may require different representations, tools, and techniques from the ones that generated the task.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Such a hierarchical deliberation process differs significantly from hierarchical planning techniques (e.g., HTN planning) for reducing the search complexity of offline, non-heterogeneous plan generation.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">The actor monitors, refines, extends, updates, changes and repairs its plans throughout the acting process, using both descriptive and operational models of actions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Ways are needed to acquire and verify these models, automatically extend them so that the actor can operate in an open environment, and do monitoring and goal reasoning.</a>
