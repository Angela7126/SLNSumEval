Note that from {a mathematical formula}C5 we have the same arguments and attacks shown in Example 4 and, in addition, the argument {a mathematical formula}A5={[J>H,Y]} can be built.</a>

<a href="#2" id="2">As reported in [36], a set of justified credibilities from a credibility base is sound if it is a strict partial order.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The following theorem shows that our approach is sound, i.e., every set of justified credibilities obtained from a credibility base is sound.</a>
