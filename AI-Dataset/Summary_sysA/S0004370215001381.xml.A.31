<a href="#0" id="0">A meta tagger is implemented by following the learning framework.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Firstly, we perform word segmentation (if applicable) and POS tagging for the unlabeled data using the baseline tagger.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Subsequently, we collect base feature instances from the auto-processed data and transform them into meta features.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, a new tagger is trained with the base features and the meta features on the training data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We define meta feature templates based on the feature buckets.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The feature templates are listed in Table 15, where {a mathematical formula}fb is a base feature.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The first template uses the preference value itself, while the second and third templates combine the value with tag {a mathematical formula}ti and word surface {a mathematical formula}wi.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The number of the new features is small.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The number of the possible values of {a mathematical formula}Pfb is at most {a mathematical formula}6×N(TB), where {a mathematical formula}N(TB) refers to the number of the base feature templates that is small.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus it is possible to have {a mathematical formula}6×N(TB) for the first type, {a mathematical formula}6×N(TB)×N(POS) for the second type, and {a mathematical formula}6×N(TB)×N(WORD)×N(POS) for the third one, where {a mathematical formula}N(POS) refers to the number of part-of-speech tags and {a mathematical formula}N(WORD) refers to the number of words.</a>
