<a href="#0" id="0">Given a game as defined in Section3, an information capture and reuse strategy (ICARUS) is a 7-tuple{a mathematical formula}(R, Θ , Θ initial, Α , Ψ , Ξ , Ω )where</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each enhancement maintains its own records and information; the policy functions are combined so that {a mathematical formula}I1 ▹ I2 uses the policy from {a mathematical formula}I1 during selection and expansion, and the policy from {a mathematical formula}I2 during simulation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Selection and expansion nodes are defined in Section 4.2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The second way of combining enhancements is linear combination.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For two ICARUSes {a mathematical formula}I1 and {a mathematical formula}I2 as above, and a function {a mathematical formula} Λ : Θ base → [0,1] (the mixing coefficient, which is a function of the information for the baseline ICARUS as defined in Specification 1), the combination {a mathematical formula} Λ I1+(1 − Λ )I2 is defined as in Specification 6 with the exception of the policy function:{a mathematical formula} We can generalise this to define any convex combination of two or more enhancements in the natural way.</a>
