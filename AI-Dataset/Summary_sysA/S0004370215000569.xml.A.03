<a href="#1" id="1">It is straightforward to show that {a mathematical formula} Γ k is a prime subnetwork of Γ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We call {a mathematical formula} Γ c the core of Γ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Suppose Γ is the RCC5 network specified as below{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}P={PP,EQ}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show {a mathematical formula}(viEQvj) is in {a mathematical formula} Γ p.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula} Γ p is exactly {a mathematical formula} Γ m.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Suppose Γ is an RCC5/8 network over a distributive subalgebra {a mathematical formula}S and {a mathematical formula} Γ p its a-closure.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Write {a mathematical formula}(xTy) for the constraint between x and y in {a mathematical formula} Γ p ′ , the a-closure of {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider the constraint network Γ over {a mathematical formula}H5 shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}(xSy) is redundant in {a mathematical formula} Γ p.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Consider the constraint network Γ over {a mathematical formula}H5 shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">It is clear that the constraint {a mathematical formula}(v3PPv2) is redundant in {a mathematical formula} Γ p.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The core {a mathematical formula} Γ c (shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This is because {a mathematical formula}(v3DRv2) is feasible in {a mathematical formula} Γ c but not in Γ .</a>
