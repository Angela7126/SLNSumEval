<a href="#0" id="0">This may be explained by the fact that the wine space contains only 330 entities (making the problem of inducing a 100-dimensional conceptual space under-constrained), the fact that {a mathematical formula}Twine contains fewer candidate terms than {a mathematical formula}Tplace and {a mathematical formula}Tmovie (potentially leading to fewer interpretable directions in the space), and the fact that we have less text, on average, per wine than per film of place type.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To select interpretable directions, we will only consider the terms in {a mathematical formula}T0.5, as a Kappa score of 0.5 was found in initial experiments to offer a good balance between keeping a sufficient number of terms and ensuring that the terms are modelled adequately as directions in {a mathematical formula}S. To select the most salient directions, we first select the term with the highest Kappa score overall.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since the value of {a mathematical formula}Ni relates to the number of entities, for the remaining problem domains, we have chosen values that reflect a similar proportion of the total number of considered entities.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this way, we can obtain a purely data-driven way to deal with gaps in a knowledge base, which can be effective even when the number of formulas is relatively small, unlike methods which are based on deriving statistical regularities from the knowledge base itself [3], [4], [68].</a>
