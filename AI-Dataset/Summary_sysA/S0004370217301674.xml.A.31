<a href="#0" id="0">Stage3.4 — Determining if the problem is fully decentralizable: one of the goals of this work is evaluating and comparing the response of an RL system under different centralized – decentralized schemes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, splitting the state vector is also proposed in order to have a fully decentralized system, and a very limited state observability for validating the usefulness of coordination of the presented MA DRL algorithms (Lenient and CA).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this case, {a mathematical formula}agentx only state variables {a mathematical formula}[x,x ˙ ] can be observed, as well as {a mathematical formula}agenty only {a mathematical formula}[y,y ˙ ].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This corresponds to a very complex scenario because both agents have incomplete observations, and do not even have free or indirect coordination due to different state spaces, decentralized action spaces, and individual reward functions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, the actions of each agent directly affect the joint environment, and both of the agents' next state observations.</a>
