<a href="#0" id="0">The L3 meta-algorithm works in 3 stages: first, it uses an RL algorithm to learn how to perform one task, storing the solution for this problem as a case in a case base; in the second stage, it maps actions of the source domain to actions of the target domain; and, in the last stage, it uses the stored cases as heuristics to speed up the Reinforcement Learning process in the target domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This extension has been defined within the L3 meta-algorithm (Algorithm 3), which works in three stages: first, the algorithm learns how to perform a task in the source domain, storing the optimal policy for this problem as a case base; second, it maps actions from the source domain to actions in the target domain; and third, it uses the case base learned in the first stage as heuristics in a CB-HARL algorithm.</a>
