<a href="#1" id="1">Skypattern operatorGiven a pattern set {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ L and a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M, a skypattern of P with respect to M is a pattern not dominated by any pattern in P with respect to M. The skypattern operator {a mathematical formula}Sky(P,M) returns all the skypatterns of P with respect to M:{a mathematical formula}</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">Minimal skylineabilityGiven a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊆ M, a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M is said to be (strictly) minimally {a mathematical formula}M ′ -skylineable iff for any patterns x and y such that {a mathematical formula}x ⊂ y and {a mathematical formula}x=M ′ y, one has {a mathematical formula}x ⪰ My (respectively {a mathematical formula}x ≻ My).</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">Distinct operatorGiven a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊆ M, the distinct operator for {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ L with respect to {a mathematical formula}M ′ and {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ { ⊂ , ⊃ } returns all the patterns x of P such that their generalizations (or specializations) are distinct from x with respect to {a mathematical formula}M ′ :{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ { ⊂ , ⊃ }.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">Indistinct operatorGiven a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊆ M, the indistinct operator returns all the patterns of {a mathematical formula}L being indistinct with respect to {a mathematical formula}M ′ with at least one pattern in P.{a mathematical formula}</a>
