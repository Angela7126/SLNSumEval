<a href="#0" id="0">For example, a solver may require that a set of linear constraints be presented as a system of linear inequalities {a mathematical formula}Ax ≤ b.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To code the LP in this “ set form ” , several mathematical programming modeling languages have been proposed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 is a parameter atom, its logical variables are bound by the logical query Φ or by the LogKB.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, if {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 is an LP atom, its logical variables are bound by the logical query Φ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}L=(A,b,c) be an LP with {a mathematical formula}A ∈ Rm×n, that is, with m constraints and n variables.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To make the connection explicit, we consider an equitable partition of a matrix M to be an equitable partition of the LP {a mathematical formula}(M,0,0), whereas an equitable partition of a bipartite graph G is the equitable partition of its bipartite adjacency matrix.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Reconsider the equitable partition {a mathematical formula}P0={{1,2},{3};{1}{2,3}{4}} of the LP {a mathematical formula}L0 in our running example.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Before showing how to compute the coarsest equitable partition, we illustrate how the lifted LP looks like for our running example {a mathematical formula}L0.</a>
