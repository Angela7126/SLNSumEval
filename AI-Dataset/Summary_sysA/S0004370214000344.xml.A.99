<a href="#0" id="0">Observe that the definition establishes that in a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[T,S] the source S cannot be in any place in T. A discussion considering the reasons for having this restriction is included in Section 9.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although our contraction operator can produce a change that is not minimal with respect to the number of credibility objects in the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, the change is minimal as discussed in [27].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In contrast to their approach, in our model the reliability is not explicitly stored; thus, in our approach when the reliability of some credibility tuple is needed (in the non-prioritized revision process), the reliability function is applied.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In Definition 3 we have established the restriction that in a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[T,S] the source S cannot appear in any place in T. The motivation for that decision is illustrated by the following example.</a>
