<a href="#1" id="1">By Theorem 3(iii), possible envy-freeness implies weak SD proportionality.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If an assignment satisfies weak SD proportionality, then there exist cardinal utilities consistent with the ordinal preferences for which proportionality is satisfied.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}m=nand it is possible to allocate to each agent an object that is not his least preferred object;{a mathematical formula}m>n.Moreover, it can be checked in polynomial time whether a weak SD proportional discrete assignment exists when agents have strict preferences.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Theorem 8</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For a constant number of agents, it can be checked in polynomial time whether a weak SD proportional discrete assignment exists even if agents are allowed to express indifference between objects.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Example 8</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Assume that the preferences of the agents are as follows.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Since m is not a multiple of n, an SD proportional assignment does not exist.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Now consider the assignment p that gives two objects to one agent and one object to the other.</a>
