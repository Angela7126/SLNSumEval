<a href="#0" id="0">In particular, in this scenario, the constraints provided by the interaction graph would be immaterial, in the sense that {a mathematical formula}{N ˆ } would be still optimal if the complete interaction graph (i.e., where every pair of agents is connected) were used in place of {a mathematical formula}G ˆ in the definition of the structure {a mathematical formula} Σ ˆ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Recall from Section 2.2 that the problem has been reduced to computing a {a mathematical formula} Σ ch-optimal coalition structure for the game {a mathematical formula} 〈 N,vch 〉 , where {a mathematical formula} Σ ch= 〈 GC,C,1,0,0, − ∞ 〉 and where {a mathematical formula}vch is any valuation function such that, for each set of nodes {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ N ∪ C with {a mathematical formula}C ∩ C={ci}, {a mathematical formula}vch(C)= ∑ e ∈ E,e ⊆ Cweci (see Theorem B.4 in Appendix B).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since the values of the form {a mathematical formula}vci ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}vcj ⁎ correspond to valuations of Σ -feasible coalitions, by putting the above ingredients together, we conclude that:{a mathematical formula}In order to conclude the proof, note that the left side of the above equation involves polynomially-many values, and recall that each of them can be computed in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular, it has been shown to be feasible in polynomial time over the class {a mathematical formula}CTW-h(mcn), in absence of valuation structures and for any fixed natural number h[43].</a>
