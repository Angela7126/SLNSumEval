<a href="#1" id="1">The projection of Π in s with respect to the incomplete model {a mathematical formula}D ˜ , {a mathematical formula} Γ ( Π ,s), is defined as the union of all projection of Π from s with respect to each and every complete models in {a mathematical formula} 《 D ˜ 》 :{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The transition function {a mathematical formula} Γ D( Π ,s) with respect to a complete model {a mathematical formula}D ∈ 《 D ˜ 》 is defined recursively as follows:{a mathematical formula} In order to complete the definition of {a mathematical formula} Γ (s, Π ), it is necessary to define {a mathematical formula} Γ D( 〈 a 〉 ,s), the resulting state after applying action a in state s with respect to a complete model {a mathematical formula}D. Given that the domain model {a mathematical formula}D ˜ used during planning is incomplete, it is quite expected that some action of a synthesized plan might fail to be applied during execution.</a>
