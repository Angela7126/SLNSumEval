<a href="#1" id="1">Previous approaches automatically configure sequential portfolios with a large set of training data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Also, it has been shown that remarkable results in Automated Planning are possible with the uniform method, which allocates the same amount of time to each solver in the sequential portfolio.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table A.7 shows the candidate planners considered to compute the OSS portfolio for the sequential optimization track of the IPC 2011 in Section 6.1.1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The set of candidate planners used in Section 6.1.3 to assess the performance of the portfolios computed with gop in optimal planning is shown in Table A.8.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The OSS portfolio for the sequential satisficing track of the IPC 2011 has been configured in Section 6.2.1 with the set of candidate planners shown in Table A.9.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The assessment of gop to configure sequential portfolios in satisficing planning has been described in Section 6.2.3.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We have compared the performance of the portfolios automatically derived with gop against fdss using the sets of candidate planners shown in Table A.10, Table A.11.</a>
