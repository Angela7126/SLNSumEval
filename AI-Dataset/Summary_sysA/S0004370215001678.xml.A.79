<a href="#0" id="0">Traditionally, high-performance heuristic algorithms are designed through an iterative, manual process in which most design choices are fixed at development time, usually based on preliminary experimentation, leaving only a small number of parameters exposed to the user.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Existing work on algorithm synthesis is mostly focused on automatically generating algorithms that satisfy a given formal specification or that solve a specific problem from a large and diverse domain (see, e.g., [77], [57], [21]).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our validation results showed that in every case, reference solvers and their SATenstein-LS implementations have the same run-length distributions on a small set of 10 validation instances chosen from block world and software verification, based on a Kolmogorov – Smirnov test (5000 runs per solver – instance pair with significance threshold 0.05).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to study the effectiveness of our proposed approach for algorithm design, we configured SATenstein-LS on training sets from various distributions of SAT instances and compared the performance of the SATenstein-LS solvers thus obtained against that of several existing high-performance SAT solvers on disjoint test sets.</a>
