<a href="#0" id="0">We assume the quality criterion for a plan Π to be its length {a mathematical formula}| Π |, that is a plan Π is optimal iff it contains the minimal number of actions among all plans solving {a mathematical formula}M. Nevertheless, all techniques presented in this article are easily modified for a quality criterion based on the (non-negative) cost of actions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to find a plan, the MADLA Planner searches through a state-space (where states are {a mathematical formula}s ⊆ P) induced by the input multi-agent planning problem, driven by a pair of a projected (local) heuristic and a distributed (global) heuristic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If node u was expanded by a public action, a message {a mathematical formula}MSTATE is sent to all other agents, containing the public projection {a mathematical formula}s ▷ pub of state s together with the private unique identifiers representing the private parts of all agents, its {a mathematical formula}u.g, its heuristic value {a mathematical formula}u.h and a parameter d determining whether it was evaluated using the local or distributed heuristic in order to determine to which open list it should be added.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The plan reconstruction message {a mathematical formula}MRECONSTRUCT= 〈 s ▷ pub, Δ i,t, Α k 〉 contains the state s (represented as {a mathematical formula}s ▷ pub and the private unique identifier {a mathematical formula} Δ i of the receiving agent), from which the reconstruction should continue, a discrete time-point t, initially set to {a mathematical formula}u.g of the last search node u (that is, the search node which satisfied the goal condition) and the agent {a mathematical formula} Α k which started the plan reconstruction.</a>
