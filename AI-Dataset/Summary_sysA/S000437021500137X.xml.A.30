<a href="#1" id="1">As an illustration of how this is done, suppose that items {a mathematical formula}v1 and {a mathematical formula}v2 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">1 are sparse items.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">SSTF creates an augmented tensor by incorporating the relationships composed of {a mathematical formula}u1 (or {a mathematical formula}u2), CV1 (or CV2), and “ Breathless ” into the original tensor.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, it determines multiple sets of sparse objects according to their degree of sparsity and creates multiple augmented tensors; this gives semantic biases to sparse objects according to the degree of sparsity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Next, it factorizes the original tensor and augmented tensors simultaneously to compute feature vectors for objects and classes (Section 4.3.2).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">SSTF incorporates semantic biases into the tensor factorization by updating the feature vectors for objects using those for classes.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, it creates feature vectors for classes, CV1 and CV2, which share semantic knowledge on sparse items, {a mathematical formula}v1 and {a mathematical formula}v2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">2-(i), SSTF lifts items in the most sparse item set {a mathematical formula}Vs(1) to their classes (the size is {a mathematical formula}Sv(1)) and creates an augmented tensor {a mathematical formula}Rv(1) from the original tensor {a mathematical formula}R. It also lifts items in the second-most sparse item set {a mathematical formula}Vs(2) to their classes (the size is {a mathematical formula}Sv(2)) and creates an augmented tensor {a mathematical formula}Rv(2) from {a mathematical formula}R.</a>
