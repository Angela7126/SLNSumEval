<a href="#0" id="0">Our task is now to learn the parameters Θ of a Bayesian network, from a dataset {a mathematical formula}D that is subject to the constraints {a mathematical formula}C. We propose to seek those parameter estimates Θ that maximize the constrained log likelihood, as given in Equation (3){a mathematical formula} However, due to the constraints {a mathematical formula}C, it may be intractable to even evaluate the CLL, for a given candidate set of estimates Θ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, we will propose to optimize instead an approximation of the CLL found by relaxing the equivalence constraints {a mathematical formula}C, and then compensating for the relaxations, as dictated by the RCR framework (which we further described in the previous section).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This approach to parameter estimation is akin to approaches that use a tractable approximation of the log likelihood, such as one obtained by loopy belief propagation; see, e.g., [14], [15].</a>
