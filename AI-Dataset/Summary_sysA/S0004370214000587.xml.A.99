<a href="#1" id="1">The nature of this similarity may be determined by a number of methods, many of which might associate visual or geometric features to points in a coordinate space, and compute similarity as a distance metric.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this example, the problem is to determine for which of the candidate images the transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ is made most analogous to transformation T. We first will represent T as a fractal representation, and then generate a set of candidate transformations Ω as shown in Fig.</a>
