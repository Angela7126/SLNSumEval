<a href="#0" id="0">Then, {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ B follows via the last axiom of {a mathematical formula}Tn.Toward the claimed triple-exponential lower bound, we now show that every uniform interpolant of {a mathematical formula}Tn for {a mathematical formula} Σ ={A1,A2,B,r,s} must contain for each {a mathematical formula}C ∈ C2n − 1 a GCI of the form {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ B ′ with {a mathematical formula}B ′ =B or {a mathematical formula}B ′ =B ⊓ F for some F (where we consider structural variants – i.e., concepts whose characteristic interpretations are isomorphic – as syntactically equal).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a regular tree grammar {a mathematical formula}G=(S,N,F,R), the derivation relation {a mathematical formula} → G associated to G is a relation on terms from {a mathematical formula}T(F ∪ N) such that {a mathematical formula}s → Gt if and only if there is a rule {a mathematical formula}N → Α ∈ R and there is a context C such that {a mathematical formula}s=C[N/X] and {a mathematical formula}t=C[ Α /X], where X is a variable from {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
