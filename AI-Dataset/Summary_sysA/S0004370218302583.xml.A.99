<a href="#0" id="0">The structure of the gadgets will make sure that this can happen if and only if the 3SAT instance F is satisfiable.More precisely, we use {a mathematical formula}|X| choice gadgets numbered from 1 to {a mathematical formula}|X|, {a mathematical formula}|X| clause/garbage gadgets (that may each model up to two clauses) numbered from {a mathematical formula}|X|+1 to {a mathematical formula}2|X| and {a mathematical formula}(k − 2|X|) filler gadgets numbered from {a mathematical formula}(2|X|+1) to k. As every literal may appear at most twice, note that the number of clauses is bounded by {a mathematical formula}|C| ≤ 4|X|3 ≤ 2|X| and hence the {a mathematical formula}|X| clause/garbage gadgets provide enough space to model all clauses in C.Using this numbering, we can further partition the above sets as follows:{a mathematical formula} Note that the sets {a mathematical formula}Gj have 10, 13 or 15 elements, depending on whether they are a subset of {a mathematical formula}GX, {a mathematical formula}GCG or {a mathematical formula}GF, respectively.SetM, the spawning process The relation between elements of the set of winners M is recursively defined via a linear ordering of players as follows: We start with player {a mathematical formula}m1.</a>
