<a href="#0" id="0">For all canonical knowledge bases{a mathematical formula}KB, LLEis sound.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, under the refined semantics, the restriction of {a mathematical formula}DLN to N-free knowledge bases is almost rational with respect to the postulates in Table 4; the only difference is that CM applies only to consistent normality concepts, as discussed in the previous section.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The DLs based on rational closure recalled in Section 2.4 satisfy the analogue of Table 4 where each inclusion {a mathematical formula}NC âŠ‘ D corresponds to a conditional {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure}D. In this case, the cost to be payed is the inability of applying defeasible axioms to role values (so our counterexamples cannot be modeled).</a>
