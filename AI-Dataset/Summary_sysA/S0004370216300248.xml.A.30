<a href="#0" id="0">[11] proposed a PNSP approach for mining positive and negative sequential patterns in the form of {a mathematical formula}<(abc)¬(de)(ijk)>.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Support of negative sequencesGiven a m-size and n-neg-size negative sequence ns, for{a mathematical formula} ∀ 1 − negMSi ∈ 1 − negMSSns(1 ⩽ i ⩽ n), the support of ns in sequence database D is:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The NSC based on {a mathematical formula}<(ab)cd> include:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}Clearly, we can generate all NSC that satisfy the three constraints for all PSP in a sequence database, as described in Section 3.2.1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">According to the above discussions, the union set operation is only needed when {a mathematical formula}k ≥ 3 and {a mathematical formula}m ≥ 2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence the comparison times of all union set operations in e-NSP, {a mathematical formula}CTe − NSP, is{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">1) PSPs are mined by GSP algorithms and from these PSPs, all positive itemsets are derived as {a mathematical formula}1 − size PSP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">2) {a mathematical formula}1 − size NSP are derived from these {a mathematical formula}1 − size PSP, where the support of {a mathematical formula}1 − size NSP is more than or equal to min_sup but less than or equal to a user specified missing frequency threshold miss_feq.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The support of a negative sequence {a mathematical formula}<¬e> is calculated by Equation (4), as in e-NSP.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Next we analyze {a mathematical formula}CTPNSP.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Because the generation method of NSC in PNSP is different from that in e-NSP, {a mathematical formula}|NSC|PNSP is also different from {a mathematical formula}|NSC|e − NSP.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula}|NSCkPNSP| denote the number of all {a mathematical formula}k − size NSCs, {a mathematical formula}|PNSPk| denote the number of all {a mathematical formula}k − size PSP and {a mathematical formula}k − size NSP in D. According to the generation method of NSC in PNSP,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We further assess the runtime of e-NSP {a mathematical formula}Te − NSP and PNSP {a mathematical formula}TPNSP in terms of the data factors describing the characteristics of a dataset.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In Table 8, Table 9, {a mathematical formula}tNegGSP(s), {a mathematical formula}tPNSP(s) and {a mathematical formula}te − NSP(s) represent the runtime of NegGSP, PNSP and e-NSP in terms of seconds (s) respectively.</a>
