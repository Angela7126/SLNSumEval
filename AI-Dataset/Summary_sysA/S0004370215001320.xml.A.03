<a href="#0" id="0">Our system is enhanced by adding knowledge and reasoning sub-modules, which can deal with incomplete information to infer human activities, even when we use semantic rules in an untrained scenario.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, if we take the sandwich scenario and we assume the perception module recognizes the hand motion m = tool_use and a new object pepper with the object property {a mathematical formula}oh(t), then for this example, our system will fail to infer the human behavior because the object pepper was not defined.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using this equivalent state {a mathematical formula}si, our system can correctly infer the human activity using the corresponding predicate from the reasoning engine.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, we obtained the tree {a mathematical formula}Tsandwich shown at the top of Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, using the tree obtained, we can determine six hypotheses {a mathematical formula}(Hsandwich), which represent semantic rules that describes the basic human activities.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, the semantic rules obtained from the tree {a mathematical formula}Tsandwich generalized the human activities very well for the sandwich scenario.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The next challenge was to test the semantic rules in unknown scenarios, where we used the set of hypotheses {a mathematical formula}Hsandwich to infer human activities in new situations, and thus we did not generate new hypotheses to infer human basic activities.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">These results indicate that the tree obtained, {a mathematical formula}Tsandwich, could generalize the definition of human basic activities in kitchen scenarios.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The previous results were obtained using the label information when one human performed different activities with the right hand.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The results obtained after testing human activities performed by both hands demonstrated our comprehensive approach.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the next step, we tested the information obtained from module 1 (see Section 7.1), i.e., from the automatic segmentation of human motions and object properties.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, if the activity is a sub-class of not_move, then the human activity will either be take or idle according to the semantic rules (see the rules in Fig.</a>
