<a href="#0" id="0">It is important to note that if ∇ is an ES basic fusion operator, restricted to the triple {a mathematical formula}W ⁎ , {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ , N, we can establish analogous results to those presented in Section 4 and Appendix A, adapting their statements to the case where a selected finite society N is chosen, the profiles are restricted N-profiles {a mathematical formula} Φ ⁎ over {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ , integrity constrains E, {a mathematical formula}E ′ are epistemic states in {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ and the interpretations w, {a mathematical formula}w ′ and {a mathematical formula}w ″ are elements in {a mathematical formula}W ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From this and the fact that {a mathematical formula}w>w ′ , it follows that {a mathematical formula}w ≻ Φ Π ≥ w ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, {a mathematical formula} Φ ↦ ⪰ Φ Π ≥ satisfies Property 3.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Similarly we obtain that Properties 4 and 4 ′ hold.In order to show that a quasilinearized projective operator satisfies (ESF-U), we will prove that {a mathematical formula} Φ ↦ ⪰ Π ≥ Φ satisfies property (u) given in Proposition 5.</a>
