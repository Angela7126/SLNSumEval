<a href="#0" id="0">The core difficulty in computing the winners under the Monroe and Chamberlin – Courant rules is in selecting the alternatives that should be assigned to the agents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a preference profile and a set S of up to K alternatives, using the standard network-flow argument, it is easy to find a (possibly partial) optimal assignment {a mathematical formula} Φ Α S of the agents to the alternatives from S.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Below we describe our algorithms for {a mathematical formula} Α B,dec-Monroe-SatWinner and for {a mathematical formula} Α B,dec-CC-SatWinner.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Formally speaking, every approximation algorithm for {a mathematical formula} Α B,dec-Monroe-SatWinner also gives feasible results for {a mathematical formula} Α B,dec-CC-SatWinner.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, some of our algorithms are particularly well-suited for both problems and some are tailored to only one of them.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, for each algorithm we clearly indicate if it is meant only for the case of Monroe, only for the case of Chamberlin – Courant, or if it naturally works for both systems.</a>
