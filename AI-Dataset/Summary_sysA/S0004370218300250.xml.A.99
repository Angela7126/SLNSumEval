<a href="#0" id="0">We prove with Lemma 1 and Proposition 1 that the overall argument classification introduced in Definition 12 complies with the properties of an argument fallibility classification stated in Definition 10.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For this reason, whenever an incremental fallibility classification {a mathematical formula}FI ⁎ Δ is considered, the symbol {a mathematical formula}FI will denote the overall argument classification associated to {a mathematical formula}FI ⁎ Δ , which will be directly called the argument fallibility classification associated to {a mathematical formula}FI ⁎ Δ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We aim now at defining a set based argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}FLE= 〈 AA, ↠ 〉 (Definition 28) capturing the notion of argument acceptance in AAS.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We restrict our consideration to systems where for every argument Α the set {a mathematical formula}Sub( Α ) is finite.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As pointed out in [13], Definition 62 allows arguments which are ‘ backward ’ infinite and hence have an infinite set of subarguments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, given the property of attack accuracy, item 2 of Definition 35 requires that {a mathematical formula} ‖ Z ‖ ∈ ‖ { Γ } ‖ − for some proper subargument Γ of Α . Iterating the same reasoning step on Γ we would derive an impossible infinite sequence of distinct ultimately infallible proper subarguments of Α , leading to a contradiction.Let us then consider such argument Β .</a>
