<a href="#0" id="0">In our game, starting from an equal initial propensity for each pure strategy (as proposed in [28]) would result in a mixed strategy with equal coverage probability at each target.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Due to the differences in animal densities, if we start from a uniform mixed strategy, it would leave many of the targets of high animal density to be attacked in round 1 (as evidenced from other human subject experiments conducted in the past [66]) and that would result in a defender utility which is much lower than the cumulative utility for any of our models over five rounds (see Section 12 for details).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, for our experiment with the RL approach, we assumed that the defender starts with the robust Maximin strategy in round 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The use of Maximin as the initial strategy also ensures that we allow the RL model to start from the same starting point as all other models, and that it does not have an initial advantage or disadvantage compared to other models.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, we used Maximin to compute the initial propensities for pure strategies in this setup; we used Comb Sampling on the Maximin mixed strategy [76] to compute the probability of playing each pure strategy and considered those to be the initial propensities for each pure strategy.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We then updated the propensities based on round 1 attack data for Maximin on {a mathematical formula}ADS1 and computed the corresponding mixed strategy and deployed that as the round 2 strategy.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Based on this experiment, results and comparisons of the RL based approach against other models are shown in Section 12.1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Comparison with SUQR ({a mathematical formula}w1>0): As mentioned earlier in Section 7.1, we conduct additional human subjects experiments on {a mathematical formula}ADS1 to show that the performance of SUQR without probability weighting is worse than any of the other models.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We deployed an experiment on AMT with the defender strategy computed based on the SUQR model learned from round 1 data of {a mathematical formula}ADS1.</a>
