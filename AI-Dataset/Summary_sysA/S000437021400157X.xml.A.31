<a href="#0" id="0">An impressive recent approach to the problem of 3D object mapping is the SLAM++ system by Salas-Moreno et al.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">[28], which performs real-time recognition of 3D furniture models in RGB-D data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This allows them to build a 3D object map of the scene and use that map in the SLAM loop to simultaneously track the camera pose.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The key difference to our approach is that our system is applicable to arbitrary 3D data like point clouds from laser scanners and does not rely on the special structure of RGB-D frames.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This allows us to use arbitrary 3D sensors or use several registered frames as input to cope with the recognition of large objects that cannot be captured in a single frame.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We see our model-based object recognition method as an instance of a more general system architecture (Fig.</a>
