<a href="#0" id="0">If{a mathematical formula} Σ ↑ is coherent,{a mathematical formula}( Σ ↑ )wI ⊨ ( Σ ↑ ) ∈ .It suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}( Σ ↑ )wI satisfies the exemption principle.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So, let Θ , {a mathematical formula} Θ ′ be any clauses of the form below:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}We have to prove that whenever such a {a mathematical formula} Θ ′ is implied by {a mathematical formula}( Σ ↑ )wI, so is Θ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}A be a model in which {a mathematical formula} ∀ xPix is true, and {a mathematical formula} ∀ x¬Ab Α x is true for all {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ X, while the extension of the remaining predicates is determined by applying the rules in {a mathematical formula} Σ ↑ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since there are no logical relations between the predicates other than those provided by {a mathematical formula} Σ ↑ , this can be done.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The resulting model {a mathematical formula}A is a model of {a mathematical formula} Σ ↑ , but {a mathematical formula} ∀ x(Pix → ⋁ Α ∈ XAb Α x) is false on {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
