<a href="#0" id="0">Modeling a mining problem in MiningZinc follows the same methodology as modeling a constraint program: one has to express a problem in terms of variables with a domain, and constraints over these variables; for example, a set variable with a minimum frequency constraint over data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Past work showed that the execution of the frequent itemset mining task is more efficient in some CP systems if a look-ahead constraint is added.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}C2={minfreq_redundant(I,D,V)} represent this look-ahead constraint (see Section 2.4).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Recall that all specialized algorithms are registered with a predicate definition {a mathematical formula}p(±1V1, … ,±nVn) and a set of constraints C that define the problem being solved by this algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assume we wish to solve the earlier model{a mathematical formula} where the available algorithms are the LCM and FPGrowth specialized itemset mining algorithms, the maxsup and frequency specialized algorithms and the Gecode generic CP system (in that order).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then these are the ranked execution plans: {a mathematical formula} In the above we assume that LCM and FPGrowth are aware of the redundant constraint minfreq_redundant.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If not, there would be variants of each of the specialized and hybrid strategies with redundant constraints too (they would be ranked below their non-redundant equivalent as they would have more constraints for the CP system).</a>
