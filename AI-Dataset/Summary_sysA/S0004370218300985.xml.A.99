<a href="#0" id="0">Under these assumptions, as shown in [5], the expected value of the activity of each unit in the backward pass is exactly given by the standard BP equations and equal to {a mathematical formula}Bih for unit i in layer h. In other words, standard backpropagation can be viewed as computing the exact average over all backpropagation processes implemented on all the stochastic realizations of the backward network under the three forms of noise described above.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus we can reverse this argument and consider that RBP approximates this average or BP by averaging over the first two kinds of noise, but not the third one where, instead of averaging, a random realization of the weights is selected and then fixed at all epochs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By expanding and simplifying Equation (42), it is easy to see that the leading term of Q is negative and given by {a mathematical formula} Β c22/(16c12).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, using Theorem 1, for any initial conditions {a mathematical formula}a1(0), {a mathematical formula}a1(t) converges to a finite fixed point.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since {a mathematical formula}a2 is a quadratic function of {a mathematical formula}a1 it also converges to a finite fixed point, and similarly for {a mathematical formula}a3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus in the general case the system always converges to a global minimum of the error function satisfying {a mathematical formula} Α − Β P=0.</a>
