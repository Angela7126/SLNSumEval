<a href="#0" id="0">The potential of a node n is defined with respect to a given value C, and is the probability that a node n is part of a solution of cost lower than C. We prove that the node with the highest {a mathematical formula}u( ⋅ ) is the node with the highest potential, under certain probabilistic relation between the heuristic function and the cost it estimates.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Effective search algorithms for such domains employ two types of heuristics – one that estimates the cost of reaching a goal, denoted by {a mathematical formula}h( ⋅ ), and one that estimates the number of steps required to reach a goal, denoted by {a mathematical formula}d( ⋅ )[20].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If an optimal solution has not yet been found, there must be a node {a mathematical formula}n ′ ∈ OPEN that is on an optimal path to a goal and whose g value is optimal, i.e., {a mathematical formula}g(n ′ )=g ⁎ (n ′ ) (see Lemma 1 in [1]).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The minimal cost to move from {a mathematical formula}n ′ to the goal is {a mathematical formula}G ⁎ − g ⁎ (n ′ ), since {a mathematical formula}n ′ is on an optimal path to a goal.</a>
