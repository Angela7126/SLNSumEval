<a href="#0" id="0">Using the auxiliary variables, the soft constraint expressing that the points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj are assigned to the same cluster can be encoded as the clause{a mathematical formula} For some intuition, we note that if this clause is satisfied in a solution Τ , then for some k, {a mathematical formula} Τ (Aijk)=1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a set V of data points with{a mathematical formula}|V|=N, a symmetric similarity matrix W over V, and an upper limit K on the available clusters such that{a mathematical formula}1 ≤ K ≤ N, let{a mathematical formula}F2be the MaxSAT instance produced by the unary encoding on W. The clustering{a mathematical formula}cl Τ ⁎ :V → {1, … K}constructed from an optimal solution{a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ to{a mathematical formula}F2is an optimal clustering of V over all clusterings{a mathematical formula}cl:V → {1, … K}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In other words,{a mathematical formula}cl Τ ⁎ is optimal over all clusterings of V that use at most K clusters.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}F2 be a MaxSAT instance generated with the unary encoding and, given a solution Τ to {a mathematical formula}F2, let {a mathematical formula}cl Τ be the clustering constructed form Τ by the procedure described in Section 7.5.</a>
