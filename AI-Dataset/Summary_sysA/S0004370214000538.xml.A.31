<a href="#0" id="0">As we can see, for jobs with very small budgets (i.e., smaller than $100), the performance of our algorithm is similar to that of the budget-limited Ε -first and trialsourcing.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is due to the fact that with a small budget, longer exploration is a luxury, and thus, those approaches perform well with only a small budget for exploration.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, if the budget is higher than $100, our algorithm clearly outperforms the others by up to {a mathematical formula}67%.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As before, this is because our approach identifies the best-performing workers and deals with the task limits of workers (which start to become an issue with a rising budget).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We can also observe that the uniform and random algorithms are clearly worse than our approach for any budget size, as they do not take into account the workers' performance characteristics at all.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In addition, it can clearly be seen that our algorithm is the only one that can guarantee the regret bound (as the others all perform worse than the regret bound as the budget rises above $150).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">5, similar trends can be observed for larger budgets.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As in Section 6.3.1, our approach, bounded Ε -first, performs significantly better than all other benchmarks when the budget is high.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Here, the higher budget also allows it to sustain a high quality of around 80 – 90% of the optimal even when there are a few hundreds of candidates.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This is because it has a sufficient budget to explore even the larger number of candidates.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In this paper, we introduced the expert crowdsourcing problem with variable worker performance, heterogeneous costs and task limits per worker.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this problem, an employer wishes to assign tasks within a limited budget to a set of workers such that its total utility is maximised.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To solve this problem, we introduced a new MAB model, the bounded MAB, with a limited number of pulls per arm to represent task limits.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Given this, we proposed a simple, but efficient, bounded Ε -first-based algorithm that uses a uniform pull strategy for exploration, and a bounded knapsack-based approach for exploitation.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We proved that this algorithm has an {a mathematical formula}O(B23) theoretical upper bound for its performance regret.</a>
