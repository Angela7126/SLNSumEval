<a href="#1" id="1">The assumption is that some subtasks are more reasonably delegated to the person, and others to the computer.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A CI is intended not to substitute for a human employee, but to engage in a task with one.</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">Line 1 is an alert to the system by the human H; line 2 is a response from the collaborative intelligence CI.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This CI would work at multiple levels of granularity.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First, it would identify the person's priorities among what are likely to be multiple goals (e.g., conflicts, convenience, budget).</a>
