<a href="#0" id="0">Two agents {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}A2 take part in a sequential auction of items.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Section 2, we formally introduce the problem of optimal ordering for sequential auctions (OOSA), and then we show how to learn regression models from historical auction data in Section 3 using standard machine learning methods.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Subsequently, we learn regression trees for both item types {a mathematical formula}r1 and {a mathematical formula}r2, as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Item i is of type r if and only if {a mathematical formula}xi,r=1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given the learned trees in Example 2, suppose we are asked to order a new multiset of items {a mathematical formula}{r1,r2,r2}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Model evaluation: we use the learned regression models to evaluate the solutions returned by the ordering methods to compute the predicted revenues.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">4 shows that all regression models lead to good prediction, with the lowest {a mathematical formula}R2 score over 0.86.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Interestingly, despite their lower {a mathematical formula}R2 scores, the linear regression LP methods return good orderings especially lasso2lp and lasso3lp which are on average better than the three regression tree LP models.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We checked this cause by investigating whether the {a mathematical formula}R2 scores of the depth 8 regression tree are correlated with which method performing better in the model evaluation.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Moreover, in this paper, we learned regression trees and linear models from simulated data in order to test the optimization performance.</a>
