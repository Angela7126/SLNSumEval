<a href="#0" id="0">This is the first study to use taxonomies of items and SAs to address the sparsity problem while maintaining the semantic relationships expressed by linked information for tags assigned by users to items.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our method can measure the similarity of users based on items or SAs assigned to items by users, as well as using the item classes, which include the item and the that SCs contain the SAs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This approach overcomes the sparsity problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We assume that the interests of users are similar if they rate the same items using the same SAs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The approach described above measures the similarity of users based on linked taxonomies rather than a single taxonomy of items, which is the case in previous taxonomy-based method [7], [24].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, our method overcomes the sparsity problem, that occurs when applying SAs in CF, by utilizing the SAs/SCs assigned by users to items and their item classes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Next, we investigated the effects of using subjective classes on the item recommendations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, we compared Linked Taxonomies with a method that did not use a taxonomy of SAs.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{sup:15} We also investigated the effects of using item classes on the item recommendations.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, we compared Linked Taxonomies with a method that used only a taxonomy of SAs.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{sup:16} The results for the movie dataset are shown in Table 8 while those for the restaurant dataset are shown in Table 9.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We denote the method without a taxonomy of SAs as Without subjective classes and the method with only a taxonomy of SAs as Without item classes.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The results show that Linked Taxonomies had the highest accuracy in all cases for all the numbers of items in the recommendation list examined.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Linked Taxonomies improved the recommendation accuracy by measuring the similarity of users using the SAs/SCs assigned to items and those given to item classes.</a>
