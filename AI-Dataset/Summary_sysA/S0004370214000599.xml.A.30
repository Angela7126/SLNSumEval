<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}zt denote the vector of N channel states at time t. Since the space of {a mathematical formula}zt is exponentially large, we cannot integrate it out to compute the marginal conditional likelihood of the data given the event state sequence {a mathematical formula}Z1:T (and model parameters).</a>
