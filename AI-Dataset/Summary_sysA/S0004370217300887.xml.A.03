<a href="#0" id="0">ReSBDS records both {a mathematical formula}xi=vi and {a mathematical formula}xj=vj into T and generates symmetry breaking constraints once they are violated in subsequent search.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Algorithm 7 shows the constraint propagation algorithm of all symmetry breaking constraints added by LReSBDS which is in the form {a mathematical formula}A ⇒ (x ≠ v).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}P1 is backtracking from a node and symmetry breaking constraints are thus added.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">ReSBDS{a mathematical formula}=sLReSBDS when given the same set of symmetries and both use the same static variable and value orderings.Suppose {a mathematical formula}CR and {a mathematical formula}CL are the sets of all symmetry breaking constraints added by ReSBDS and LReSBDS respectively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus {a mathematical formula}P1 must be pruned by the symmetry breaking constraints added by ReSBDS.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Symmetry breaking constraints added by ParSBDS but not by ReSBDS cannot prune solutions when both use the same static variable and value orderings.Consider the resulting search trees {a mathematical formula} ϒ P of ParSBDS and {a mathematical formula} ϒ R of ReSBDS.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">ReSBDS and LReSBDS are stronger in solutions pruning than LexLeader when we consider only symmetries that are compositions {a mathematical formula} Σ ∘ Θ of a variable symmetry Σ and a value symmetry Θ .</a>
