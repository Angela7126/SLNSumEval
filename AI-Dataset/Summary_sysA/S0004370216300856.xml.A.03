<a href="#0" id="0">In order to show that playing a pure strategy does indeed lead to poor defender utility, we conducted an experiment with human subjects by deploying a SUQR based pure strategy on {a mathematical formula}ADS1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">(18):{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Nr is the total number of rounds and r is the round whose data is under consideration.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We then updated the propensities based on round 1 attack data for Maximin on {a mathematical formula}ADS1 and computed the corresponding mixed strategy and deployed that as the round 2 strategy.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We deployed an experiment on AMT with the defender strategy computed based on the SUQR model learned from round 1 data of {a mathematical formula}ADS1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This average expected defender utility obtained by deploying a pure strategy based on a learned SUQR model is significantly less than that of all the other models on {a mathematical formula}ADS1 in Round 2 (Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We deployed an experiment on AMT with the defender strategy computed based on the RL model learned from round 1 data of Maximin on {a mathematical formula}ADS1 (as explained earlier in Section 11).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This average expected defender utility obtained by deploying the defender strategy based on a learned RL model is significantly less than that of all the other models on {a mathematical formula}ADS1 in Round 2 (Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, given the poor initial round performance of the RL model on {a mathematical formula}ADS1, we did not conduct any further experiments for future rounds.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">(17)) from round to round is the mixed strategy x and hence the coverage {a mathematical formula}xi at each target.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To further illustrate that the SHARP based strategy does indeed change over rounds, we show SHARP based strategies on {a mathematical formula}ADS2 from rounds 2 – 5 in Figs.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">22, the human perceptions of probability in rounds 1 – 4 when the security experts were exposed to SHARP based strategies on {a mathematical formula}ADS3.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Otherwise, a defender strategy with a lower coverage probability on target i will achieve a higher defender expected utility than {a mathematical formula}x¯, contradict with the optimality.</a>
