<a href="#0" id="0">Indeed, a bounded number of objects yields, up to object renaming, only a bounded number of possible interpretations (of finitely many fluents and constants) at {a mathematical formula}S0.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, for some finite n depending on the theory {a mathematical formula}D and the bound b, we have that {a mathematical formula}ModD=(ModD1,ModD2, … ,ModDn).Since, by Theorem 18, any two models {a mathematical formula}M and {a mathematical formula}M ′ of the generic cell {a mathematical formula}ModDi induce persistence-preserving bisimilar transition systems, then, by Theorem 13, we have that all the models of {a mathematical formula}ModDi satisfy Φ if and only if some model {a mathematical formula}M of {a mathematical formula}ModDi satisfies Φ .</a>
