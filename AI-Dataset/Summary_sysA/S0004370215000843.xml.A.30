<a href="#0" id="0">The following section explains the representations of objects, their parts, properties, and locations in the environment as well as the robot's self-model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is followed by the representations of events and actions at the instance and class level and methods for projecting the effects of actions on objects.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our knowledge base only has a rather shallow symbolic representation of general concepts, while most information about the robot, its environment and perceptions is merely a “ virtual knowledge base ” computed at runtime from the data structures of the robot's control program.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One query to the knowledge base may require the use of different inference methods and different information sources.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This section introduces the representations and associated inference methods for objects and other spatial information.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We start with class-level knowledge about objects types, continue with object instances, the representation of positions and orientations, the computation of qualitative spatial relations, and the representation of the object geometry and their composition from parts.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The last subsection deals with special kinds of objects, namely parts of the robot and their properties.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since there is no structural difference between static objects in an environment map, movable objects detected by the robot's perception system, and parts of the robot, any kind of object information in the system can easily be compared.</a>
