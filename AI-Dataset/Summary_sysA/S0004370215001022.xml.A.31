<a href="#1" id="1">The fact that {a mathematical formula}cl Τ is well-defined follows from the observation that each point gets assigned to at most one cluster and each iteration of the procedure assigns at least one point to a cluster.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using the auxiliary variables, the soft constraint expressing that the points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj are assigned to the same cluster can be encoded as the clause{a mathematical formula} For some intuition, we note that if this clause is satisfied in a solution Τ , then for some k, {a mathematical formula} Τ (Aijk)=1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since all hard clauses are satisfied in any solution, it follows that points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj will be assigned to cluster k, exactly as required.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Similarly, if points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj are not assigned to the same cluster, then due to the hard constraints we have {a mathematical formula} Τ (Aijk)=0 for all k, and the soft clause will not be satisfied.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Each unsatisfied clause must increase the cost of a MaxSAT solution according to the similarity values of the corresponding points, which is why the weight of the clause is set to {a mathematical formula}W(i,j).</a>
