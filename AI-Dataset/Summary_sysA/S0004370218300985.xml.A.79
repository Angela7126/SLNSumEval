<a href="#0" id="0">Thus in general, in a solution of the critical equations, the weights {a mathematical formula}wijhmust depend on {a mathematical formula}Ojh − 1, the outputs, the targets, the upper weights, and the upper derivatives.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Backpropagation shows that it is sufficient for the weights to depend on {a mathematical formula}Ojh − 1, {a mathematical formula}T − O, the upper weights, and the upper derivatives.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Under these assumptions, as shown in [5], the expected value of the activity of each unit in the backward pass is exactly given by the standard BP equations and equal to {a mathematical formula}Bih for unit i in layer h. In other words, standard backpropagation can be viewed as computing the exact average over all backpropagation processes implemented on all the stochastic realizations of the backward network under the three forms of noise described above.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">With the proper scaling of the learning rate ({a mathematical formula} Η = Δ t) this leads to the non-linear system of coupled differential equations for the temporal evolution of {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}a2 during learning:{a mathematical formula} Note that the dynamic of {a mathematical formula}P=a1a2 is given by:{a mathematical formula} The error is given by:{a mathematical formula} and:{a mathematical formula} the last equality requires {a mathematical formula}ai ≠ 0.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus every {a mathematical formula}ai can be expressed as a polynomial function of {a mathematical formula}a1 of degree {a mathematical formula}2i − 1, containing only even terms:{a mathematical formula} and:{a mathematical formula} By substituting these relationships in the equation for the derivative of {a mathematical formula}a1, we get {a mathematical formula}da1/dt=Q(a1) where Q is a polynomial with an odd degree n given by:{a mathematical formula} Furthermore, from Equation (50) it can be seen that leading coefficient is negative therefore, using Theorem 1, for any set of initial conditions the system must converge to a finite fixed point.</a>
