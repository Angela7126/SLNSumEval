<a href="#1" id="1">Because the notion of state for the RuGPlanner encloses a set of fully instantiated states, the number of possible initial (instantiated) states of knowledge variables and their domain size affects planning time only with respect to the number of sensing actions which have to be included in the plan, their interdependencies, and entailed constraints.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">All plans consist of the same number of actions, however the state at which actions are placed varies: “ opt ” refers to the optimal situation where all the password sensing actions in the plan are concentrated at the first state, “ subOpt ” to the plan actually generated by the RuGPlanner by employing the random values assignment with restarts searching strategy, and “ worst ” to a plan where each password sensing action is scheduled just before the respective door opening.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To meet these requirements, we proposed and described the RuGPlanner, a planning framework which uses constraint satisfaction techniques and accommodates for complex goals, a knowledge-level representation to model lack of information, proactive sensing in the presence of variables that range over large domains, as well as an algorithm for monitoring execution and revising plans in a seamlessly changing environment.</a>
