<a href="#0" id="0">The aim of the MoD scheme is to maximize either the number of tasks that are completed (a.k.a.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">customer satisfaction) (Equation (6)) or the total number of time points that EVs are travelling (a.k.a.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">EV utilization) (Equation (7)) (i.e., the objective functions can be used alternately).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To achieve this, we present an optimal solution based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP){sup:8} (solved using IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.6.2), where we use battery swapping to cope with the EVs' limited range.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">MIP techniques have been particularly useful to solve such large combinatorial problems (e.g., combinatorial auctions [42], [3], travelling salesman problem [19]).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Also, such a solution can be used as a benchmark for more customized algorithms (as we do in this paper in Section 5.6 and Section 6).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We will refer to this algorithm as Off-Opt-Swap.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note that in case the max flow algorithm returns the optimal set of tasks to be executed, this algorithm simply calculates the EV to task execution schedule.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, if the max flow returns the upper limit in terms of executed tasks, this algorithm also decides which of these tasks can actually be executed.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In more detail, we define three binary decision variables: 1) {a mathematical formula} Λ i ∈ {0,1} denoting whether a task i is accomplished or not, 2) {a mathematical formula} Ε j,i,t ∈ {0,1} denoting whether EV j is executing task i at time t or not, and 3) {a mathematical formula}prkj,t,k ∈ {0,1} denoting whether j is parked at time point t at location k or not.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Moreover, a set of constraints is used:</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Here, we evaluate our proposed battery swap optimization algorithm against a setting where no such optimization takes place, based on the tasks assigned by the scheduling algorithms to each EV.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In doing so, we assume all EVs to carry the same battery type, which has a discharge rate {a mathematical formula}conj=10 (i.e., at each time point, 10% of the battery is discharged) and the average trip duration to be 2 time points.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The battery swap minimization algorithm is shown to achieve a reduction of up to 87.5% (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">22) in the number of necessary battery swaps.</a>
