<a href="#0" id="0">According to the semantics of these axioms, it is easy to see that dual-Horn KBs are not more expressive than core ones: a dual-Horn axiom {a mathematical formula}p → q1 ∧ … ∧ qn can be expressed by the core axioms {a mathematical formula}p → q1, … ,p → qn.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, any dual-Horn KB can be transformed into an equivalent core KB in linear time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, as we show in this paper, the complexity of pinpointing-related problems is in general higher for dual-Horn KBs than for core ones.</a>
