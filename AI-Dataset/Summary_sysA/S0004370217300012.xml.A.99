<a href="#0" id="0">The proof is by induction on the structure of the formulae.Base case:{a mathematical formula}Case Φ =p_ for some {a mathematical formula}p ∈ Π : strategy({a mathematical formula}n,p) returns true iff {a mathematical formula}s(n) ⊨ p (by lines 2 – 3 in Algorithm 2) iff {a mathematical formula}s(n),e ′ ⊨ p for any {a mathematical formula}e ′ ∈ compatible(v(n)) (by the semantics of {a mathematical formula}RAL).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For the purpose of this proof, we assume that each interior node n in T has an additional function {a mathematical formula}a(n) which returns the action tuple of the proponent at {a mathematical formula}s(n); and the function {a mathematical formula}node(n,s, Α ,A) also assigns {a mathematical formula}a(n)= Α .For every leaf n of T, we have that {a mathematical formula}strategy(n, Ψ 2) returns true according to lines 8 – 9 of Algorithm 4.</a>
