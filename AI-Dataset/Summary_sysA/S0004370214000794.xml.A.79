<a href="#0" id="0">As we see, Definition 2 does not require that the function {a mathematical formula} Ψ c(g(x)) depends only on {a mathematical formula}gc(x).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Theorem 3 or Corollary 4 shows that {a mathematical formula} Ψ c(g) admits the ISC of Zhang [28].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, under the conditions in Theorem 3 or Corollary 4, we also have the relationship between the approximate minimization of the risk based on {a mathematical formula} Ψ c and the approximate minimization of the classification error.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Although there is no explicit expression for {a mathematical formula}g ˆ (x) in Problem (7), Theorem 9 shows that its limit at {a mathematical formula}T=0 is equal to the minimizer of {a mathematical formula} ∑ c=1m ∑ j ≠ c(1+gj(x))+Pc(x), which was studied by Lee et al.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Based on {a mathematical formula}GT(g(x),c), however, there does not exist an explicit expression for the class probability similar to (8) or (16).</a>
