<a href="#0" id="0">When a value {a mathematical formula}(X,a) is deleted, it is put in the propagation queue.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This value is then picked from the queue later by the main constraint propagation procedure (not detailed in this paper), and STR3 is invoked for every constraint C such that {a mathematical formula}X ∈ scp(C).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This invocation merges {a mathematical formula}table(C,X,a) into {a mathematical formula}inv(C), because {a mathematical formula}table(C,X,a) contains the tids of all tuples that involve the deleted value {a mathematical formula}(X,a).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Subsequently, STR3 recognizes that a value {a mathematical formula}(Y,b) is GAC on C if {a mathematical formula}table(C,Y,b) ∖ inv(C) is not empty.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To check whether k is the tid of a tuple that has been found to be invalid, STR3 tests whether {a mathematical formula}k ∈ inv(C), through a call of the form {a mathematical formula}isMember(inv(C),k).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Whenever a tuple of tid k becomes invalid, STR3 must look for a new support for every value in the dependency list {a mathematical formula}dep(C,k).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Pseudo-code of STR3 is given in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">5, Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">6.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">GACInit (lines 1 – 9) is called first to remove all invalid tuples (by calling another GAC algorithm at line 2) and to initialize all data structures.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the beginning, {a mathematical formula}inv(C).members is set to zero as the remaining tuples are all valid (line 3), while the separator of each {a mathematical formula}table(C,X,a) is set to its last possible index (recall that we start indexing at 1).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We also put each value {a mathematical formula}(X,a) into an arbitrary dependency list.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">(1)</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{a mathematical formula}tup(C,k)becomes invalid.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">STR3 must seek a new support in this case.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Consequently, both supports remain synchronized (albeit with a tid different from k).</a>
