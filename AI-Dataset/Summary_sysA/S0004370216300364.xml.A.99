<a href="#1" id="1">In this algorithm, instead of updating each {a mathematical formula}evaliOP( Ω i) and {a mathematical formula}wiOP value after calculating all {a mathematical formula} Δ wi and {a mathematical formula} Δ evaliOP values when all training examples are met, each {a mathematical formula}evaliOP( Ω i) and {a mathematical formula}wiOP value is modified using training delta rules right after each single training instance is met in an incremental manner (Algorithm: lines 18, 21).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, this algorithm can easily be applied in more realistic negotiation scenarios in which training examples (opponent offers) are gradually met one at a time.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the setting adopted in Experiment I (Section 5.1.1), the accuracy of this proposed model is evaluated together with other opponent models through a Pearson Correlation between the estimated and real bid utilities [38]:{a mathematical formula} where, {a mathematical formula}uOP is the real utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ is the estimated utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP( Ω → ) is the real utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space, and {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ ( Ω → ) is the estimated utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space.</a>
