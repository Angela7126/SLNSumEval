<a href="#0" id="0">We then apply the extended matrix factorization method {a mathematical formula}fTL in the transfer learning manner on both the source and target collaborative data to learn an updated CF model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that the entity selection function {a mathematical formula}ActiveLearn() is built on top of the base method f at the initial step or the extended method {a mathematical formula}fTL at each iteration.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section, we first present a particular solution based on MMMF.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We start by introducing an extended MMMF method in the transfer learning manner with partial entity correspondences between the source and the target systems, and then present an approach to actively selecting entities to construct correspondences between systems.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, we present a second particular solution with RLMF.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We start by introducing an extended RLMF method in the transfer learning manner with flexible entity correspondences between the source and the target systems, and then present an active entity selection approach to constructing cross-system correspondences based on the extended RLMF.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this section, we present the third solution based on PMF.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We start by introducing an extended PMF method in the transfer learning manner with partial entity correspondences between the source and the target systems, and then present an active entity correspondences construction approach accordingly.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">NoTransf with actively constructed correspondences (NoTransf ({a mathematical formula}x% corr)): to first apply active learning to construct cross-domain entity correspondences ({a mathematical formula}x% of all the available cross-system correspondences), and then align the source and target domain data to generate a unified item-user matrix.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we apply state-of-the-art CF models on the unified matrix for recommendations.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}MTL with full correspondences ({a mathematical formula}MTL (100% corr.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">)): to apply the proposed transfer learning approaches on the source and target domain data with full entity correspondences for recommendations, where {a mathematical formula}M represents RLMF, MMMF and PMF accordingly.</a>
