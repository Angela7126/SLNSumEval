<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, the language DDNF satisfies the property called {a mathematical formula} ∧ C, i.e., there exists a polytime algorithm that maps every finite set of formulas {a mathematical formula} Σ 1, … , Σ n from DDNF to a formula of DDNF that is equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Σ 1 ∧ … ∧ Σ n which appears to be contradictory with the statement on the time complexity of computing {a mathematical formula} Φ Μ DNF stated at the end of Section 4.1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is because the function {a mathematical formula} Φ Μ DNF is not simply a conjunction between the current state Φ with another Μ DNF formula.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We will prove for the case that {a mathematical formula} Φ ℓ ≠ ∅ , {a mathematical formula} Φ ℓ ¯ ≠ ∅ , and neither of ℓ or {a mathematical formula} ℓ ¯ is a unit literal of Φ .</a>
