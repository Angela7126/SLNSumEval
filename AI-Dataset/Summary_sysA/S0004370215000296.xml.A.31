<a href="#0" id="0">This states that the set of plant feasible trajectories includes ones that go from {a mathematical formula}Rinit to {a mathematical formula}Rgoal over the entire duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">More specifically, if a trajectory starting anywhere in the initial region, {a mathematical formula}Rinit, of the activity (see Definition 8) and ending somewhere in the goal region, {a mathematical formula}Rgoal, at any duration d such that {a mathematical formula}l ≤ d ≤ u, is Plant Feasible, then the activity is temporally feasible in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This implies that the actuation limits imposed by the plant, and the operating constraints of the activity allow for actuation commands that can be used to control the linearized subsystem to the goal region from the initial region, at any duration in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The executive's dispatcher component executes a QCP output by the plan compiler.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To execute a QCP, the dispatcher must successfully execute each control activity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The dispatcher accomplishes this by, in real time, monitoring plant state, and generating plant control inputs based on the appropriate QCP control policy for the current state and time.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This causes the state trajectory of the linearized sub-systems to reach activity goal regions at acceptable times.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this way, the dispatcher indirectly schedules start and finish events so that they are consistent with the temporal constraints of the QCP.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is a key difference between our dispatcher, and those of discrete activity execution systems [9], in which event times are set directly by the dispatcher.</a>
