<a href="#0" id="0">These conditions entail: (1) an abstraction hypothesis guesses an observation of the observable hypothesized by the pattern; (2) a new observation is obtained from the application of the observation procedure to those observations being assigned to the set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP by the matching relation; and (3) the observations taking part in an abstraction hypothesis must satisfy those constraints of the pattern whose variables are assigned a value by the observations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An abstraction hypothesis defines in the set of observations {a mathematical formula}O a counterpart of the subsets {a mathematical formula}AP and {a mathematical formula}EP of the set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP of a pattern P, resulting from the selection of a set of observations {a mathematical formula}O Ħ ⊆ O by means of a matching relation, satisfying those requirements shown in the Definition 11.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The SUBSUME() function explores the set of observations {a mathematical formula}O and selects those consistent with the constraints on the finding in the focus of attention (line 3), expanding the matching relation of the corresponding hypothesis in different descendant interpretations (line 4).</a>
