<a href="#0" id="0">ASPIC{sup:+} studies first order classical logic instantiations in which arguments are built from premises in a given base {a mathematical formula}B, and strict inference rules {a mathematical formula}{ Φ 1, … , Φ n → Φ | Φ ∈ Cn({ Φ 1, … , Φ n}}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence arguments can be represented as in Definition 6, where an argument's premises entail an argument's conclusion through application of a single strict inference rule encoding the entailment condition 1 in Definition 6.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">k-depth C-intelim argumentsLet {a mathematical formula}T be any normal C-intelimk proof of Φ depending on Σ (recall – Definition 30 – that Σ are the actual, and not virtual assumptions in {a mathematical formula}T), where {a mathematical formula} ∀ Α ∈ Σ , Α is annotated in {a mathematical formula}T by {an inline-figure} or {an inline-figure}, where {an inline-figure} stands for “ premise ” and {an inline-figure} stands for “ supposition ” .Then {a mathematical formula}( Δ , Γ , Φ ) is a C-intelimk argument, where {a mathematical formula} Δ ∪ Γ = Σ , {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Δ iff Α is annotated by {an inline-figure}, and {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Γ iff Α is annotated by {an inline-figure}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This paper also additionally: 1) formally proves the Fundamental Lemma and existence of a unique least fixed point of a {a mathematical formula}pdAF's characteristic function; 2) provides a comprehensive study of two types of contaminated arguments; 3) formally proves the non-interference and crash resistance postulates, generalised here to first order argumentation; 4) studies instantiation of {a mathematical formula}pdAFs by natural deduction proof theories that exclude R-contaminated arguments and accommodate agents that have bounds on their inferential capabilities.</a>
