<a href="#0" id="0">M is an answer set (or stable model) of a program P if M is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}PM.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We denote by {a mathematical formula}AS(P) the set of all answer sets of P.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Similarly, if {a mathematical formula}B − (r) ≠ ∅ then we take a variable {a mathematical formula}u ∈ B − (r) and a variable {a mathematical formula}v ∈ H(r); such v exists since r is not a constraint.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We observe that {a mathematical formula}Horn ⊊ no-BC by again considering the program {a mathematical formula}P3 which belongs to {a mathematical formula}no-BC, but is obviously not Horn, and by considering the fact that all rules r in a Horn program P satisfy {a mathematical formula}|H(r)| ≤ 1 and {a mathematical formula}B − (r)= ∅ which yields that the dependency graph {a mathematical formula}UP contains no bad vertices and hence gives us that {a mathematical formula}UP contains no bad cycles.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We will see that neither of them admits a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the size of a strong {a mathematical formula}C-backdoor for the considered target classes, subject to standard complexity theoretical assumptions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By means of the algorithm that solves the problem Strong{a mathematical formula}C-Backdoor Asp Check (see Lemma 3.7) we observe that {a mathematical formula}{b,c,f} is the only answer set of P.</a>
