<a href="#0" id="0">Given a preference profile and a set S of up to K alternatives, using the standard network-flow argument, it is easy to find a (possibly partial) optimal assignment {a mathematical formula} Φ Α S of the agents to the alternatives from S.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus the total dissatisfaction of the agents in the optimal solution is:{a mathematical formula} By taking large enough m and K (even for a fixed value of {a mathematical formula}mK), the fraction {a mathematical formula}1 − K − 12(m − 1) can be arbitrarily close to the approximation ratio of our algorithm (the reasoning here is somewhat in the spirit of the idea of identifying maximally robust elections, as studied by Shiryaev, Yu, and Elkind [53]).</a>
