<a href="#0" id="0">Subsequently, STR3 recognizes that a value {a mathematical formula}(Y,b) is GAC on C if {a mathematical formula}table(C,Y,b) ∖ inv(C) is not empty.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Whenever a tuple of tid k becomes invalid, STR3 must look for a new support for every value in the dependency list {a mathematical formula}dep(C,k).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section, we trace the execution of STR3 on the ternary positive table constraint C, with scope {a mathematical formula}{X,Y,Z}, depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}tup(C,k ′ )becomes invalid while{a mathematical formula}tup(C,k)remains valid.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Because STR3 seeks a new valid support for {a mathematical formula}(X,a) only when {a mathematical formula}tup(C,k) is invalid (line 21), nothing needs to be done.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For any{a mathematical formula}C ∈ C,{a mathematical formula}X ∈ scp(C), and{a mathematical formula}a ∈ Dc(X), no tid of any support of{a mathematical formula}(X,a)on C exists in{a mathematical formula}table(C,X,a).explored.This invariant holds when the search starts since GACInit initially eliminates all invalid tuples and assigns the separators to their maximum values.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Afterwards, when the tuple {a mathematical formula}tup(C,table(C,X,a)[ ↑ ]) becomes invalid, STR3 scans down {a mathematical formula}table(C,X,a) until a new valid support is found, in which case the separator is set to the new value; the invariant holds.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First, a value is deleted and put in the propagation queue as soon as STR3 exhausts all possibilities for supports (Invariant 3 where {a mathematical formula}table(C,X,a).explored=table(C,X,a) and line 26).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The worst-case time complexity of STR3 along a single path of length m in the search tree is{a mathematical formula}O(rt+m)per constraint.STR3's operations can be seen from the point of view of the three main data structures: table, inv, and dep.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Pseudo-code of STR3 with circular seek ({a mathematical formula}STR3circ) is given in Fig.</a>
