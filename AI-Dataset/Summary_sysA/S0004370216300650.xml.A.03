<a href="#0" id="0">Now suppose {a mathematical formula} ∃ x ′ ∈ X.c1 ∧ 2(x ′ ,y → ) is satisfied.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">According to the definition of Ψ we conclude that either {a mathematical formula}a ∉ P or {a mathematical formula} Φ (b → ) have to be satisfied.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This means that it does not rule out the possibility where {a mathematical formula} ∃ x ′ ∈ P.c1 ∧ 2(x ′ ,y → ) is stronger than {a mathematical formula} ∃ x ′ ∈ X.c1 ∧ 2(x ′ ,y → ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is quite possible that the smaller the set P is and the weaker the literal {a mathematical formula}x ∉ P is, the stronger {a mathematical formula} ∃ x ′ ∈ P.c1 ∧ 2(x ′ ,y → ) becomes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}c1 cannot detect a conflict on its own in the context of {a mathematical formula}Dx ′ ,Dy ‾ ′ :{a mathematical formula}</a>
