<a href="#0" id="0">We say that a plan has the potential to solve the planning problem, if it corresponds to an execution path which subsumes a sequence of states that satisfy the propositions inferred by the goal.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The set of constraints resulting from the translation of the planning domain, the propositions referring to the initial state and the goal form the CSP are passed to the constraint solver.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The constraint solver computes a valid assignment to the CSP variables that model the planning actions, and this assignment corresponds to an optimistic plan that has the potential to solve the planning problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">3 shows plan computation time with respect to an increasing number of variables with domain range {a mathematical formula}[1,100], which all have to be sensed to fulfill the goal.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Sensing actions are dependent on each other, so that they have to be performed in sequence in the plan (i.e., plan length is equal to the number of unknowns).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Because the notion of state for the RuGPlanner encloses a set of fully instantiated states, the number of possible initial (instantiated) states of knowledge variables and their domain size affects planning time only with respect to the number of sensing actions which have to be included in the plan, their interdependencies, and entailed constraints.</a>
