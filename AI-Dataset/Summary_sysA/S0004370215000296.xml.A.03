<a href="#0" id="0">This control policy specifies z as a linear function of the initial state {a mathematical formula}x(0).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The algorithm accomplishes this by choosing an initial feasible state, {a mathematical formula}x(0), and determining a polytope about this state within which a particular control policy is optimal.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Qualitative State PlanA Qualitative State Plan (QSP) is a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 E,A,C 〉 , where E is a set of Events, A is a set of Activities, and C is a set (conjunction) of externally imposed temporal constraints on the start and finish times of the activities.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}x(t) must satisfy the initial and goal region state constraints of a.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The duration range {a mathematical formula}[li,ui] for each activity {a mathematical formula}ai is a temporal constraint on the activity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For the case of the last cross section before the goal, the new state requirement is {a mathematical formula}xnew ∈ Rgoal, where {a mathematical formula}Rgoal is the goal region specified for the activity in the QSP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, unlike discrete activity systems, which can simply set the occurrence of events so that they coincide with target completion times, our dispatcher must generate control inputs that guide the hybrid plant to its goal state at the target completion time.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Valid Control Policy for Target Completion TimeA Valid Control Policy that results in achievement of an activity's goal state at time {a mathematical formula}tf is denoted by {a mathematical formula}P(tf); it is a Valid Control Policy with respect to the target completion time {a mathematical formula}tf.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Temporally Controllable Activity for Target Completion Time and Current StateAn activity is Temporally Controllable for Target Completion Time {a mathematical formula}tf from current state x if there exists a Valid Control Policy for Target Completion Time, {a mathematical formula}P(tf), that covers x.</a>
