<a href="#0" id="0">Multiple model approaches use distinct models: an abstract descriptive model for planning and one or several operational models for acting to refine each plan step into skills.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These approaches may use either (i) a uniform knowledge representation for specifying planning and acting problems at different levels of granularity, e.g., formal action languages, or (ii) heterogeneous knowledge representations at various levels, e.g., precondition â€“ effect operators for planning, procedures or rules for acting.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The state of the art for the acquisition of deliberation models remains very preliminary.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We discussed a few approaches for acquiring semantic maps and integrating the learned knowledge into planning and acting models.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These and similar approaches are strongly needed in service and domestic robots and other applications with similar features (see Table 1).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also discussed a few Reinforcement learning and Learning from Demonstration approaches which appear as promising research direction that have not yet been developed at the deliberation level in robotics.</a>
