<a href="#0" id="0">In this article, we introduced novel formulation and methods for anticipatory action selection for human – robot interaction, combining anticipation and planning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We formulated the anticipatory action selection as optimal stopping in a partially observable Markov decision processes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The presented formulation, using latent state variables and Bayesian nonparametric model, is expressive for nonlinear and stochastic human behaviors, such as table tennis strokes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We first presented a policy learning approach using the Least-Squares Policy Iteration algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, the LSPI can be sample-inefficient, as it does not exploit the transition model in the Intention-Driven Dynamics Models.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consequently, we presented the Monte-Carlo Planning approach, which benefits from the transition model estimated by the IDDM framework.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The presented framework is generic and can be used in many other human – robot interaction scenarios, for example, in navigation and human – robot co-manipulation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A typical application would be one where the robot observes the actions of a human, makes predictions about the human's intention with the IDDM, and reacts accordingly by either waiting for more observations or by executing a physical action, where the uncertainties in prediction needs to be considered in deciding when and how to plan the robot's own actions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this article, we motivated and evaluated the proposed framework with human – robot table tennis games, where a bottleneck is the limited amount of time for the robot to execute a hitting movement.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Movement initiation requires an early decision on the type of action, such as a forehand or backhand movement, before the opponent has hit the ball.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Experimental results using real data and a simulated environment showed that the anticipatory action selection can be used for a robot table tennis player to enhance its performance against human players, where the robot decided the timing to initiate a selected hitting movement according to the prediction of the human opponent.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We concluded that anticipatory action selection substantially improves the robot's performance, and that uncertainties in prediction needs to be taken into account for optimal stopping.</a>
