<a href="#0" id="0">For example, given constraint {a mathematical formula}allDifferent(x,y,z) where all variables have domain {a mathematical formula}{1,3,5,7}, Savile Row adds constraints {a mathematical formula}x+y+z ≥ 1+3+5 and {a mathematical formula}x+y+z ≤ 3+5+7.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">10 (left) plots the speed-up quotient with the CP solver for Molnar's Problem on the twelve instances where {a mathematical formula}k ∈ {2 … 4} and {a mathematical formula}d ∈ {2 … 5}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each allDifferent constraint on a row, column or subsquare represents a permutation of {a mathematical formula}{1 … 16} which sum to 136.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Savile Row automatically adds implied sum constraints as described in Section 4.4.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the first tailoring process the implied sums will be {a mathematical formula} ∑ X=136 where X is the set of variables in the row, column or subsquare.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the second tailoring process some variables may be assigned and deleted, with the assigned value removed from other variables in the same row, column or subsquare.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The implied sums for rows, columns and subsquares will be of the form {a mathematical formula} ∑ X=c but the constant c may differ.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the experiments above we have recommended the following set of reformulations: variable unification, standard domain filtering, aggregation, Identical CSE and X-CSE.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To gauge how effective this set of recommended reformulations are, Fig.</a>
