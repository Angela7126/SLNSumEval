<a href="#0" id="0">In the above formulation, the agent has a fixed set of {a mathematical formula}n( ≥ 1) input exploratory options.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, the number of learnable target options is equal to the total number of learnable abstractions, which is at most equal to the number of input exploratory options:{a mathematical formula} To enable continual learning[29], the number of skills acquired by the agent should not necessarily be bounded and the agent needs to reuse the previously acquired skills to learn more complex skills.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, continual curiosity-driven skill acquisition learning problem is a slightly modified version of the above formulation, such that the target options learned form a basis for new input exploratory options:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}F(.)</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">denotes some functional variation of a deterministic target option to make it stochastic (exploratory).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, the number of input exploratory options (n) increases whenever a new skill is acquired by the agent.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If the estimation error of any already learned abstraction modules for the incoming observations is lower than threshold Δ , the exploratory-option's policy is learned using Least-Squares Policy Iteration Technique (LSPI; [53]), with an estimation of the transition model actively updated over the option's state-space {a mathematical formula}Iie ⊆ S Φ , and an estimated reward function that rewards high estimation errors.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, a method that uses a simpler abstraction learning algorithm may acquire a large number of skills, which could be functionally equivalent to acquiring a single skill of a more discriminative abstraction estimator.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, evaluating different task-unrelated intrinsically-motivated (IM) approaches without providing an external goal is an ill-posed problem.</a>
