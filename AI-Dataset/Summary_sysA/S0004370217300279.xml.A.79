<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:6} Notice that, the exponential size of the game tree does not constitute a proof that finding the equilibrium strategies of an SRG-v requires exponential time in the parameters of the game because it does not exclude the existence of some compact representation of {a mathematical formula}D's strategies, e.g., Markovian strategies.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The decision problem MAX – COV-SET is defined as:INSTANCE: an instance of SRG-v with a target set T and a covering set {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊂ T;QUESTION: is {a mathematical formula}T ′ maximal?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The optimization version of k – SRG-v, say OPT – SRG-v, is{a mathematical formula}APX-hard even in the restricted case in which the graph is metric, there is only one signal s, all targets{a mathematical formula}t ∈ T(s)have the same penetration time{a mathematical formula}d(t), and there exists a maximal covering route covering all the targets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If otherwise, the condition is verified, then the algorithm (assuming validity of Conditions 1 and 2) might obtain a covering set {a mathematical formula}Q¯v,wk+1 which is not a proper one, meaning that by walking its generative route at least one target {a mathematical formula}t ′ ∉ Q¯v,wk+1 gets covered.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider a problem instance with a single signal, arbitrary target values while topology and penetration times are as follow:{a mathematical formula}We report the expansions made by the algorithm for increasing cardinalities (value of k) in the following table.</a>
