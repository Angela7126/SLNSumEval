<a href="#0" id="0">Different sciences have different subject matters, and AI is the study of intelligent behaviour in computational terms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We want multiple-choice questions that people can answer easily.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our approach is best illustrated with an example question:{a mathematical formula} A Winograd schema question is a binary-choice question with these properties:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To summarise: With respect to the Turing Test, we agree with Turing that the substantive question is whether or not a certain intelligent behaviour can be achieved by a computer program.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Think of the behaviour of people on Winograd schema questions as a natural phenomenon to be explained, not unlike photosynthesis or gravity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">From a pure technology point of view, a reasonable question to ask here is this: Can we produce a good semblance of the target behaviour without having to deal with background knowledge like this?</a>
