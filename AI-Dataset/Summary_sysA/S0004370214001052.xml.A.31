<a href="#5" id="5">The algorithm uses reward vectors and assumes that each player tries to maximise his own reward in a {a mathematical formula}maxn fashion [39], [40], thus the algorithm can handle games with {a mathematical formula} Κ >2 players as well as single-player and two-player games.</a>
