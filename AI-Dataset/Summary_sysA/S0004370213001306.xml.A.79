<a href="#0" id="0">We contribute a learning algorithm that uses only observations of the performance of teams of two and three agents, in order to learn the agent capabilities and weighted graph structure of the weighted synergy graph.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The learning algorithm iterates through weighted graph structures, and computes the agent capabilities using the observations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This assumption is reasonable as the effect of agents working in a team is captured by the compatibility function and their distance in the weighted synergy graph, so the variables representing their individual capabilities ({a mathematical formula}Ci,Cj) are independent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this section, we explain how to use a weighted synergy graph to form the Δ -optimal team for the task, i.e., the team {a mathematical formula}A Δ ⁎ such that {a mathematical formula}P(PA Δ ⁎ ⩾ u)= Δ and {a mathematical formula}P(PA ⩾ u) ⩽ Δ ∀ A ⊆ A.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Using the weighted synergy graph model and the synergy equations, we can compute the synergy of a team of agents {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ A.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this way, neighbor teams are generated from the current best estimate {a mathematical formula}Abest so as to effectively explore the space of possible teams of size n. The value of the neighbor team {a mathematical formula}vneighbor is computed with Evaluate, and the team is accepted or rejected based on the criteria of the approximation algorithm (e.g., simulated annealing uses a temperature schedule).</a>
