<a href="#0" id="0">The method we apply to obtain these solvers is a portfolio tuning approach ISAC++ which generalizes both tuning of individual solvers as well as combining multiple solvers into one solver portfolio.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first show the performance of ISAC++ on partial MaxSAT instances: a benchmark set of crafted instances, one consisting of industrial instances, and finally a set that contains both crafted and industrial instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the second set of experiments we train solvers for MaxSAT (MS), Weighted MaxSAT (WMS), Partial MaxSAT (PMS), and Weighted Partial MaxSAT (WPMS).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In these datasets we will combine instances from the crafted, industrial and random subcategories.</a>
