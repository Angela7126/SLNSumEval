<a href="#0" id="0">Instance: Player set N, pairwise comparison matrix P, a distinguished player {a mathematical formula}i ⁎ ∈ N, and target probability {a mathematical formula}q ∈ [0,1].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Question: Does there exist a draw Σ for the player set N for which the probability of {a mathematical formula}i ⁎ winning {a mathematical formula}T(N, Σ ) is at least q?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Instance: Player set N, deterministic pairwise comparison matrix P, and a distinguished player {a mathematical formula}i ⁎ ∈ N.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Question: Does there exist a draw Σ for the player set N for which {a mathematical formula}i ⁎ is the winner of {a mathematical formula}T(N, Σ )?</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Proof</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">TFP is NP-complete even if the distinguished player is a king.First, note that in any instance satisfying the conditions of Lemma 5, {a mathematical formula}m1 is a king (by beating {a mathematical formula}z1 who in turn beats every other player).Let {a mathematical formula}F=(X,C) be a 3SAT instance where each literal appears at most twice.</a>
