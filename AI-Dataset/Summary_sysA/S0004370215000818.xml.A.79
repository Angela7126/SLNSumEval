<a href="#0" id="0">Our task is now to learn the parameters Θ of a Bayesian network, from a dataset {a mathematical formula}D that is subject to the constraints {a mathematical formula}C. We propose to seek those parameter estimates Θ that maximize the constrained log likelihood, as given in Equation (3){a mathematical formula} However, due to the constraints {a mathematical formula}C, it may be intractable to even evaluate the CLL, for a given candidate set of estimates Θ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This leads to the following approximation of the constrained log likelihood, that also factorizes according to the examples i:{a mathematical formula} Here, {a mathematical formula}Pr Θ , Λ denotes the distribution of the base network, which is now determined by two sets of parameters: (1) the parameter estimates Θ of the Bayesian network that we seek to learn, and (2) the parameters Λ of the soft observations {a mathematical formula}vi that are used to compensate for the relaxed equivalence constraints {a mathematical formula}C. Note that we use two sets of compensations {a mathematical formula} Λ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Λ 2, to approximate {a mathematical formula}P(D,C| Θ ) (with the dataset observed in the meta-network) and {a mathematical formula}P(C| Θ ) (with the dataset unobserved in the meta-network).</a>
