<a href="#0" id="0">We first consider the class of social choice functions known as k-approval functions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For any {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ k ≤ m − 1, the k-approval function is the scoring function, denoted {a mathematical formula}fk, with score vector {a mathematical formula}s → k=(1,1, … ,0,0) that has exactly k ones and {a mathematical formula}m − k zeros.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We assume ties among highest-scoring alternatives are broken uniformly at random.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We begin by defining a randomized social choice function f. For a non-negative integer i, define the sets of alternatives {a mathematical formula}Bi( Σ → ) as follows.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Set {a mathematical formula}B0( Σ → ) consists of all alternatives in A.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For {a mathematical formula}i ≥ 1, an alternative {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Bi − 1( Σ → ) belongs to {a mathematical formula}Bi( Σ → ) if there exists a utility profile {a mathematical formula}u → a ∈ p − 1( Σ → ) in which a has maximum social welfare and, furthermore,{a mathematical formula} for all {a mathematical formula} ℓ ∈ {0,i − 1}.</a>
