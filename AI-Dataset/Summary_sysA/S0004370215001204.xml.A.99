<a href="#0" id="0">In the max case, if the true value is at least V then we say Yes for some Ζ , and if the true value is less than V then {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I, Ζ )<v for all Ζ and therefore we always say No.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus the problem is in NP.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the min case, if the true value is at least V then all Ζ yield Yes, and if the true value is less than V then some Ζ yields No.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus the problem is in co-NP.For the inductive step assume that the claim holds for {a mathematical formula}k − 1 and consider the input {a mathematical formula}(B,I,V) with an interpretation I, value bound V and a max-k-alternating diagram {a mathematical formula}B=maxw1 ⁡ minw2 ⁡ … QwkAB(w1, … ,wk) where in order to simplify the notation each {a mathematical formula}wi may be a single variable or a set of variables and we use the boldface notation to denote this fact.Now for each tuple i of domain objects in I (which is appropriate for the number of variables in {a mathematical formula}w1) let diagram {a mathematical formula}B ′ be {a mathematical formula}B ′ =minw2 ⁡ … QwkAB(w1=i, … ,wk).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We conclude that the aggregated value for this prefix is 0.</a>
