<a href="#0" id="0">If an increasing threshold search is to improve search costs, then a two-step strategy {a mathematical formula}S=[r1,r2=xmax] alone will provide some improvement [9].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The expected total cost when using this strategy is:{a mathematical formula} in which {a mathematical formula}P=F(r1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The first two terms are the costs associated with the use of the first reservation value {a mathematical formula}r1, and the third term is the cost of obtaining all agent values if no values were obtained using {a mathematical formula}r1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The optimal two-step strategy is obtained by determining the value P that minimizes (15).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">4 shows the expected cost, the expected number of search rounds, and the 99.9th percentile of the number of search rounds required to find the best-valued agent as a function of the number of agents N, for the different values of Α and function assignments to {a mathematical formula} Β (j).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that the scale of the y-axis in the first set of charts varies with Α in order to improve visualization.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The figure also shows the reservation values to be used in each search round when {a mathematical formula}N=20.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As expected, Α has a substantial effect on the search strategy and expected cost.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The reservation value increases as a function of Α , since the tradeoff associated with each reservation value accounts for a greater cost of continuing the search if no agent is found.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Although the expected number of search rounds decreases as a consequence, the expected cost still increases, due to the greater cost per round.</a>
