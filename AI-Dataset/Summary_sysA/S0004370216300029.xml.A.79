<a href="#0" id="0">We restrict our attention here to formulas of the form{a mathematical formula} which correspond in a natural way to rules of form (1) where for {a mathematical formula}l=0, the formula {a mathematical formula}a1 ∨ ⋯ ∨ al is ⊥ ; every program P corresponds then similarly to a theory (set of formulas) {a mathematical formula} Γ P.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">They show that {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model semantics is with respect to model checking (MCH) and inference (INF) one level higher up in the polynomial hierarchy than the {a mathematical formula}EQ-model (i.e., answer set) semantics; this is not surprising as the characterization of a {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model in Theorem 2 involves besides h-minimality also gap-minimality, while the {a mathematical formula}EQ-model definition involves only h-minimality.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, the program P in Example 4 has a single P-stable model, and thus P has a single L-stable model which coincides with its well-founded model; thus we cannot conclude under L-stable semantics from P that {a mathematical formula}visits_barber(joe) is false.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Also the program in Example 22 has a single P-stable (and L-stable) model in which all atoms are undefined, while c is true under {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Similarly, the program{a mathematical formula} has a single P-stable (and thus L-stable) model in which all atoms are undefined; if we add the rules {a mathematical formula}d ← a, {a mathematical formula}d ← b, and {a mathematical formula}d ← c to P, the new program cautiously entails under both semi-stable and {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model semantics that d is true, but not under L-stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This lemma in turn follows from Proposition 12 in [19], which states this property for partial stable models of constraint-free (even disjunctive) programs, and {a mathematical formula}WF(P) is the least partial stable model; note also that constraints in P merely determine the existence of {a mathematical formula}WF(P) but do not influence the truth valuation of atoms.</a>
