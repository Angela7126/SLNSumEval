<a href="#0" id="0">These k-size coalitions transfer the problem data to a single agent, which performs a complete search procedure in order to find the best assignment for all agents within the k-size coalition.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a result, the algorithm converges to a state that is k-optimal[34], i.e., no better state exists if k agents or fewer change their assignments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Notice that these algorithms were first designed for distributed constraint satisfaction problems in which a solution must not violate any constraint, but they can be applied without any adjustment to Distributed Max-CSPs (DisMaxCSPs) (where the optimal solution is the complete assignment with the smallest number of violated constraints), which is a specific type of DCOP.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Notice that as long as the amount reduced from all costs is identical, the algorithm is not affected by this reduction since only the differences between the costs for the different values matter.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A message sent from a function-node f to a variable-node x in iteration i includes for each possible value {a mathematical formula}d ∈ Dx the minimal cost of any combination of assignments to the variables involved in f apart from x and the assignment of value d to variable x.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Formally, the message from f to x includes for each value {a mathematical formula}d ∈ Dx:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}ass − x is a possible combination of assignments to variables involved in f not including x.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our investigation of this algorithm revealed that for specific problems it is possible to use constant probabilities for making the same decisions made by agents in DSA-SDP, i.e., the decisions on whether to replace a value assignment for the best alternative or to periodically change to a non-improving value assignment.</a>
