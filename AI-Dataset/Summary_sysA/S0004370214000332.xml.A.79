<a href="#0" id="0">Then, the energy of a given protein conformation, defined by a choice of one specific amino acid with an associated conformation (rotamer) for each residue, can be written as:{a mathematical formula} where E is the potential energy of the protein, {a mathematical formula}E ∅ is a constant energy contribution capturing interactions between fixed parts of the model, {a mathematical formula}E(ir) is the energy contribution of rotamer r at position i capturing internal interactions (and a reference energy for the associated amino acid) or interactions with fixed regions, and {a mathematical formula}E(ir,js) is the pairwise interaction energy between rotamer r at position i and rotamer s at position j[24].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These values correspond to forbidden assignments because the sum of the corresponding binary term plus the two unary costs plus the current lower bound {a mathematical formula}E ∅ (produced by soft arc consistency) is greater than or equal to the current upper bound k. Such values s do not need to be considered by the min operation because {a mathematical formula}{ir,js} does not belong to any optimal solution, whereas {a mathematical formula}{iu,js} may.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Worst-cost differences are computed by the function {a mathematical formula}getDifference(j,i,u,r) applied to every binary cost function related to i, discarding forbidden assignments with {a mathematical formula}{ir,js} (line 8), as suggested by Eq.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For that, we define a new dynamic variable ordering heuristics selecting at each node of the search tree the variable minimizing the ratio of its current domain size divided by the sum of the median costs of all its current cost functions (including its unary cost function).</a>
