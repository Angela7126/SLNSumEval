<a href="#0" id="0">The issues identified with so-called naive representations in the preceding section largely stem from the following fact: given that encodings of arguments, {a mathematical formula}pi ∈ X are effectively achieved for free – that is, for all natural numbers k, {a mathematical formula}pk ∈ X and no further analysis is needed – the task of describing {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A 〉 comes down to describing the (infinite) set {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our main aim in this paper has been to present a formal approach to describe both finite and infinite af structures, the argument set being the set of words within some regular language, {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ Σ ⁎ , and the attack relation, {a mathematical formula}A over {a mathematical formula}X×X being given through a sentence, {a mathematical formula}a ∈ AE( Σ ) constructed by a limited set of operations so that for {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ X, {a mathematical formula}a ̲ (S) satisfies additivity (hence also monotonicity) and preserves regularity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In fact preliminary results of the authors, with {a mathematical formula}B ⊆ Σ 2 and the constraint “ {a mathematical formula}v → aw iff ({a mathematical formula}v ∈ B and {a mathematical formula}tl(B)=hd(w)) or ({a mathematical formula}v ∈ Σ ⋅ w) ” indicate, using a careful treatment of the dfa form accepting {a mathematical formula}X that all of the cases shown to be effectively computable in Theorem 3 may be efficiently implemented (in terms of state complexity and polynomial run-time).</a>
