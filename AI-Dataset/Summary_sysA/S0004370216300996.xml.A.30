<a href="#1" id="1">To restore GIC, Function restoreAfterDeleting(), presented in Algorithm 9, must be called.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When this function is called for, it is for a GIC-staged configuration trace {a mathematical formula}T= 〈 N1, … ,Np 〉 on a CN N from a sequence of decisions {a mathematical formula} Δ = 〈 Δ 1, … , Δ p 〉 .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In lines 1 – 3, GAC is maintained after each decision taken in sequence from {a mathematical formula} Δ replay.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, in lines 4 – 7, we process each level in sequence from bottom to top.</a>
