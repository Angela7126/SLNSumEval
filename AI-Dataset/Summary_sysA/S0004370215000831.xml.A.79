<a href="#0" id="0">Here we show how we can add a number of typically used data mining constraints {a mathematical formula}must – link, {a mathematical formula}cannot – link, and {a mathematical formula}must – link – before as linear constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While global {a mathematical formula}cannot – link or {a mathematical formula}must – link constraints have been shown to improve the performance of hierarchical clustering, they were designed for flat clustering and do not take into account the hierarchical nature of a dendrogram.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In some ways this constraint is less powerful than local {a mathematical formula}must – link constraints because they only specifies the relative ordering of how points should be merged.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However in practice local constraints are difficult to specify whereas it is generally easy to specify a {a mathematical formula}must – link – before constraint.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our results in Table 3, Table 4 show that our method outperforms standard hierarchical clustering for real world language evolution and fMRI data sets for finding the best hierarchy (matching the ground truth).</a>
