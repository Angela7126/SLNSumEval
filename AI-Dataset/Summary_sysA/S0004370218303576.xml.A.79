<a href="#0" id="0">Note that Theorem 6 shows that in order to obtain a stable labelling (of a revision), it is sufficient to enforce the label in or out for certain arguments that are labelled undec by {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">a set of arguments not comprising any argument from some preventing set have no stable labelling that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, preventing sets define a sufficient condition for “ preventing ” the existence of a stable labelling that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let{a mathematical formula}undec(LabArgpref) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The only complete labelling of{a mathematical formula}AF ↓ undec(LabArgpref)labels all arguments asundec.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since the undec -part has only one complete labelling, which labels all arguments as undec, this labelling is also its only preferred labelling.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, the question as to why {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref is not a stable labelling can be reduced to the question as to why the only preferred labelling of the undec -part is not a stable labelling.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">SCUPs and preventing sets share the property that if none of their arguments is involved in a revision, then the revision has no stable labelling that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref (see Theorem 9, Theorem 23).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By Theorem 12, we know that if a revision has a stable labelling that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref, the set of arguments used for the revision must be a superset of some enforcement set.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These results imply that odd-length cycles of arguments labelled undec by {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref are an important characteristic of sets of arguments that prevent {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref from being a stable labelling (Theorem 35).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Furthermore, it is sufficient to revise (specific) arguments in odd-length cycles to obtain a stable labelling (of the revision) that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref (Theorem 34).</a>
