<a href="#0" id="0">The problem of ad hoc teamwork revolves around how an agent should cooperate with teammates it knows little about.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this article, we assume that the teammates are given; the ad hoc agent does not select its teammates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the ad hoc agent may not know its teammates' behaviors ahead of time; we investigate how an ad hoc agent can reuse knowledge about past teammates to learn quickly about its new teammates.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Specifically, we explore settings in which the ad hoc agent has prior experiences with past teammates and is trying to use knowledge from these experiences to quickly adapt to new teammates.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, the ad hoc agent must observe its teammates to determine their behaviors.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Once it knows the behaviors its teammates exhibit, the ad hoc agent can adapt accordingly.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">[63] which evaluates an ad hoc team agent while considering the teammates and domains it may encounter.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">When the ad hoc agent knows its teammates' behaviors, {a mathematical formula}TeamK=1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that this may not be the optimal performance of any team, but it is optimal for the ad hoc agent given that the behaviors of its teammates are fixed.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The short summary of the approach is that the ad hoc agent either learns about a set of prior teammates or is given some hand-coded information about possible teammates.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">These results show that the ad hoc agent can do much better than just copying the behavior of its teammates by using PLASTIC-Model.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The ad hoc agent does know that these teammates are drawn from the set of hand-coded predators.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Ideally, the ad hoc agent should be able to use the observations of its past teammates to better cooperate with its current teammates.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">PLASTIC-Model allows the ad hoc agent to adapt to a variety of teammates.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">It is an ad hoc teamwork problem due to the fact that the ad hoc agent does not know the behavior of its teammates and its past teammates are not necessarily representative of its current teammates.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The teammates in this article are not explicitly learning about the ad hoc agent as it interacts with them.</a>
