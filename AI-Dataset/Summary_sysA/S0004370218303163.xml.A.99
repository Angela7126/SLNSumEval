<a href="#0" id="0">The set of observations that may be abstracted in an interpretation problem IP is {an inline-figure}, that is, observations corresponding to observables involved in the set of findings to be abstracted by some abstraction pattern.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An abstraction hypothesis defines in the set of observations {a mathematical formula}O a counterpart of the subsets {a mathematical formula}AP and {a mathematical formula}EP of the set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP of a pattern P, resulting from the selection of a set of observations {a mathematical formula}O Ħ ⊆ O by means of a matching relation, satisfying those requirements shown in the Definition 11.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given an interpretation problem IP and an abstraction hypothesis {a mathematical formula} Ħ = 〈 oh,P, ↢ 〉 , we define the following sets of observations:</a>
