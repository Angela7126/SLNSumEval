<a href="#0" id="0">Note that Theorem 6 shows that in order to obtain a stable labelling (of a revision), it is sufficient to enforce the label in or out for certain arguments that are labelled undec by {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref is a stable labelling then the only more or equally committed labelling is {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref itself.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, for any set {a mathematical formula}Args ⊆ Ar it holds that there exists a revision {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ =AF of {a mathematical formula}AF w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}Args by {a mathematical formula}LabArg such that some revision labelling {a mathematical formula}LabArg ⊛ of {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ is a stable labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ , then {a mathematical formula}Args ⊉ Argsenf where {a mathematical formula}Argsenf is an enforcement set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, {a mathematical formula} ∃ A ∈ Argsenf such that {a mathematical formula}A ∉ Args.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since this holds for all enforcement sets {a mathematical formula}Argsenf, let {a mathematical formula}Args ′ be the set of all such A occurring in some enforcement set such that {a mathematical formula}A ∉ Args, so {a mathematical formula}Args ′ consists of at least one argument from each enforcement set.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By Theorem 10, {a mathematical formula}Args ′ ⊇ Argsprev where {a mathematical formula}Argsprev is a preventing set.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Clearly, {a mathematical formula}Args ⊆ Ar ∖ Args ′ , so {a mathematical formula}Args ⊆ Ar ∖ Argsprev where {a mathematical formula}Argsprev is a preventing set.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">These results imply that odd-length cycles of arguments labelled undec by {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref are an important characteristic of sets of arguments that prevent {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref from being a stable labelling (Theorem 35).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Furthermore, it is sufficient to revise (specific) arguments in odd-length cycles to obtain a stable labelling (of the revision) that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref (Theorem 34).</a>
