<a href="#0" id="0">Minimal size Α of clusters: this means that each point must be in a cluster with at least Α points (including itself).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For each {a mathematical formula}i ∈ [1,n], the assigned value of the variable {a mathematical formula}Gi must then appear at least Α times in the array {a mathematical formula}G, i.e.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}#{j|Gj=Gi} ≥ Α .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, for each {a mathematical formula}i ∈ [1,n], we put the constraint: atleast{a mathematical formula}( Α ,G,Gi).This constraint helps also to set a bound on the number of possible clusters.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Indeed, the number of clusters cannot exceed {a mathematical formula} ⌊ n/ Α ⌋ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the second model, this can be expressed by {a mathematical formula}Gi ≤ ⌊ n/ Α ⌋ , for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ [1,n].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Minimal split Δ : a Δ -constraint requires that the split between two clusters must be at least Δ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore for each couple {a mathematical formula}i<j ∈ [1,n] such that {a mathematical formula}d(i,j)< Δ , the constraint {a mathematical formula}Gi=Gj is put.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}V1 is the sum of dissimilarities between the assigned points:{a mathematical formula}</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">Since {a mathematical formula} Δ 1D is a partition that minimizes the diameter among all the partitions satisfying the user constraints {a mathematical formula}C (line 3), there exists no partition Δ satisfying {a mathematical formula}C with {a mathematical formula}D( Δ )<D( Δ 1D).</a>
