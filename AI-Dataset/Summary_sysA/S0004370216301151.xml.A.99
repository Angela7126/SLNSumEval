<a href="#0" id="0">Our model is based on similar assumptions, but it differs in three main aspects: i) utterances given to our learner offer a partial or total description of the scene, but they do not refer to things that are not in the scene; ii) we are not limited to word learning (our learning task is more complex: our system learns to generate and understand relevant utterances in a given scene); iii) we use a richer semantic representation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The learner collects information about the co-occurrence of words and predicates, and uses the semantic situation to help it translate the teacher's utterances to meanings.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The teacher's meanings are generalized via the semantic categories to general forms that are the basis of the learner's own utterances.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The learner refines its ability to use the general forms to produce grammatical utterances by collecting data from alignments of the teacher's utterances with the general forms.</a>
