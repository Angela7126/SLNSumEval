<a href="#0" id="0">Most methods surveyed in the earlier sections use models that make predictions about a single agent, following the agent model shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For methods that predict an agent's actions, such as policy reconstruction (Section 4.1), type-based reasoning (Section 4.2), and recursive reasoning (Section 4.5), modelling single agents is predicated on the assumption that agents choose actions independently from each other, as defined in Section 3.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, many papers proceed by explaining their methods for a single agent, with the underlying idea that the same method can be used to maintain separate models for each other agent.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that this separation does not mean that agents ignore each other, since the models may base their predictions on the observed actions of other agents.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Nonetheless, there are important cases in which it may be preferable to use group models which make joint predictions about a group of agents.</a>
