<a href="#3" id="3">It is also a corollary of the recent and more complex Theorem 3.1 in [17].Suppose we have an algorithm A that generates a solution to a GIC constraint network N in time bounded by a polynomial {a mathematical formula}p(|N|).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, as 3Col is NP-complete, there cannot exist a polynomial algorithm for generating a solution to a GIC constraint network, unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP.</a>
