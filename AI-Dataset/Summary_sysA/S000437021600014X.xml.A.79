<a href="#0" id="0">Given a POMDP G with a reachability objective {a mathematical formula}Reach(T), a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ Σ is almost-sure winning iff {a mathematical formula}P Λ 0 Σ (Reach(T))=1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We will denote by {a mathematical formula}AlmostG(T) the set of almost-sure winning strategies in POMDP G for the objective {a mathematical formula}Reach(T).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a set U such that all states in U have the same observation, a strategy is almost-sure winning from U, if given the uniform probability distribution {a mathematical formula} Λ U over U we have {a mathematical formula}P Λ U Σ (Reach(T))=1; i.e., the strategy ensures almost-sure winning if the starting belief support is U.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The standard finite-horizon value iteration algorithm for expected total cost in the setting of perfect-information MDPs can be formulated by the following equation:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Vn ⁎ (s) represents the value of an optimal policy, when the starting state is s and there are n decision steps remaining.</a>
