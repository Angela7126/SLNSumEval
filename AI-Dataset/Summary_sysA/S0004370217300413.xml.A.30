<a href="#1" id="1">for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N, the formula {a mathematical formula} Γ i is the goal of player i, represented as a temporal logic formula; in what follows, we consider both LTL and CTL as possible goal languages.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a strategy profile {a mathematical formula} Σ → =( Σ 1, … , Σ i − 1, Σ i, Σ i+1, … , Σ n) and a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i ′ for player i, then by {a mathematical formula}( Σ → − i, Σ i ′ ) we will denote the strategy profile that is the same as {a mathematical formula} Σ → except that the strategy for player i is {a mathematical formula} Σ i ′ , that is:{a mathematical formula} Then {a mathematical formula} Σ → is said to be a Nash equilibrium of G if for all players i and all strategies {a mathematical formula} Σ i ′ for player i, we have{a mathematical formula} Hereafter, we let {a mathematical formula}NE(G) be the set of (pure strategy) Nash equilibria for an RMG G. As is usually the case in game theory, it is possible that {a mathematical formula}NE(G)= ∅ (there are no equilibria), or that {a mathematical formula}NE(G) contains just one, or multiple equilibria; there may even be infinitely many equilibria.</a>
