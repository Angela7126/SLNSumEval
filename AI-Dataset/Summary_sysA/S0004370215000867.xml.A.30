<a href="#0" id="0">We can construct a PDB which stores the shortest distance to the nearest abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since in Sokoban the goal state is defined implicitly, every placement of the {a mathematical formula}k ′ stones on the k goal squares is an abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The heuristic value of a state is the sum of the heuristic value for the maze zone, obtained by the IPDB, a heuristic value for the goal zone, and global linear conflicts between stones adjacent to the cut square and a stone at the cut square.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the goal zone we use a heuristic function similar to the standard heuristic function EMM of Sokoban.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 7 shows the number of explored nodes and the solving time for all instances that could be solved by at least one of the solvers ({a mathematical formula}RS ⁎ , EMM, MPDB, IPDB).</a>
