<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, let us consider LARS programs in which Α and each formula {a mathematical formula} Β i are positive, i.e., each atom occurs in the formula tree only under an even number of negations; we call such programs positive.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As for windows, we naturally call a window function wmonotonic, if for any streams S and {a mathematical formula}S ′ such that {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ S ′ and for any time {a mathematical formula}t ′ it holds that {a mathematical formula}w(S,t ′ ) ⊆ w(S ′ ,t ′ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then we obtain</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Concerning time-based window operators {a mathematical formula} ⊞ ℓ ,u(d), as already observed above, evaluating the window function {a mathematical formula} Τ ℓ ,u(d)(S,t) on the stream S at time point t always yields a substream {a mathematical formula}S ′ =(T ′ , Υ ′ )=(T ′ , Υ |T ′ ), i.e., {a mathematical formula}S ′ restricts S to the timeline {a mathematical formula}T ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If we apply a further time-based window on {a mathematical formula}S ′ , we obtain another stream of this form.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Overall, there are {a mathematical formula}O(|T|2) many such {a mathematical formula}S ′ ; if we take possible occurrence of the reset operator ▹ into account, there are {a mathematical formula}O(|T ⋆ |2) many such streams.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, Theorem 10 holds for all LARS formulas that use only time-based window operators.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By this proposition, we can reduce model checking of a LARS formula Φ on an input stream {a mathematical formula}S=(T, Υ ), to model checking an ad-hoc PLTL formula constructed from Φ , M and the specific time point {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T, on a single path {a mathematical formula} Π (M).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In particular, we can do this for {a mathematical formula}T=[0,t], i.e., at the end of the input stream.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Furthermore, we can transform the PLTL formula easily to an LTL formula that is initially equivalent.</a>
