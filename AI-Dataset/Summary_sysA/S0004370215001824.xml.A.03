<a href="#0" id="0">The solver also scored second place for crafted partial MaxSAT instances.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first show the performance of ISAC++ on partial MaxSAT instances: a benchmark set of crafted instances, one consisting of industrial instances, and finally a set that contains both crafted and industrial instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, at the 2013 MaxSAT Evaluation MSE13, ISAC+2013 solved instances that no other solver submitted was able to solve, using one of the parameterizations that ISAC++ had generated automatically.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, the weighted partial MaxSAT instances number 718.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, we built three instance-specific partial MaxSAT solvers for crafted and industrial instances, as well as a combination of those.</a>
