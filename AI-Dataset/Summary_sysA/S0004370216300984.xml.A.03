<a href="#0" id="0">All current state-of-the-art parallel SAT solvers are based on this approach (judging by the results of recent SAT competitions).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the 2015 SAT Race we introduced a new track for solvers supporting interactive incremental SAT solving â€“ the Incremental Library Track (ILT).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A benchmark for the ILT is an application (and inputs for it) that uses SAT solvers interactively.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One of the adapted SAT solvers included in the package was the Java SAT solver Sat4j.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore this benchmark application makes it possible to compare the incremental SAT solvers that are part of the IPASIR framework on the CNFs of the BMC workflow.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We believe that this will prove to be very useful for SAT solver users and increase the already high number of systems which use SAT solvers as their reasoning engines.</a>
