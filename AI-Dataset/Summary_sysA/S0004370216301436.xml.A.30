<a href="#1" id="1">In the following, it is assumed that the best performance corresponds to the lowest value, associated to rank 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Besides the performance matrix, Alors will also exploit the rank matrix M, where {a mathematical formula}Mi,j reports the rank of the j-th algorithm on the i-th problem instance (Table 1).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Alors also exploits – for its cold-start functionality only – the {a mathematical formula}(n,d) matrix X, yielding the initial d-dimensional representation of the problem instances.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first indicator, noted cf, measures the performance of algorithm selection on known problem instances based on an excerpt of matrix {a mathematical formula}M. After the above discussion, the cf performance reflects the quality of the set of problem instances, called benchmark in the following.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The second performance indicator, noted cs, measures the quality of algorithm selection for new problem instances.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The sensitivity of both performances with respect to the incompleteness rate p of the {a mathematical formula}M matrix and the number k of latent factors is studied on two real-world benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">An artificial problem is also defined to investigate and compare Alors and Matchbox.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">using the latent factors to fill-in matrix {a mathematical formula}Mp and determining the selected algorithm for each i-th problem instance;</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The rank of the single best baseline is circa 60 – with the caveat that the statistical significance of the differences between the algorithm performances is not available.</a>
