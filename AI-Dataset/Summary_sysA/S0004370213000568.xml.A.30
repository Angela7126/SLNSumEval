<a href="#0" id="0">Despite this fact, we can show several interesting results regarding the connection between the three notions (recovery, relevance, partial meet) in Boolean logics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let us start by investigating the relation between relevance and recovery.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We say that relevance implies recovery (in the presence of the other AGM postulates) in a logic {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 iff, whenever a contraction operator − satisfies relevance (and the other AGM postulates), it also satisfies recovery.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The definition of recovery implying relevance is completely analogous.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We say that relevance and recovery are equivalent in a logic {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 iff relevance implies recovery and vice-versa.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If a logic{a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 is Boolean,{a mathematical formula}K,A ⊆ Land A is finitely representable, relevance and recovery are equivalent (in the presence of the other AGM postulates).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consider a logic{a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 that is Boolean and either is compact or satisfies the ascending chain condition.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consider also two beliefs{a mathematical formula}K,A ⊆ Lsuch that A is finitely representable.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Then the logic is both AGM-compliant and relevance-compliant, and the following are equivalent:</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If a logic{a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 is Boolean,{a mathematical formula}K,A ⊆ Land A is finitely representable, recovery implies relevance (in the presence of the other AGM postulates).Take {a mathematical formula}K − A the result of a contraction operation that satisfies the AGM postulates (by Theorem 4.4 there is such an operation).</a>
