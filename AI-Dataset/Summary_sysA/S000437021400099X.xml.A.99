<a href="#0" id="0">This result shows that there are problems for which no efficient optimization algorithm exists (making the common assumption that the complexity classes {a mathematical formula}P and {a mathematical formula}NP are not identical), but that have a (small) polynomial unbiased black-box complexity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Here in this work we will be concerned only with so-called pseudo-Boolean functions, i.e., real-valued objective functions defined on the set {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n of bit strings of length n. This is motivated by the fact that many randomized search heuristics, in particular evolutionary algorithms, use such a representation.</a>
