<a href="#0" id="0">the set of FlatZinc constraints over {a mathematical formula}V1, … ,Vn that specify the problem this algorithm can solve (multiple sets can be given in case of multiple equivalent formulations);</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Example 8</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Past work showed that the execution of the frequent itemset mining task is more efficient in some CP systems if a look-ahead constraint is added.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}C2={minfreq_redundant(I,D,V)} represent this look-ahead constraint (see Section 2.4).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This constraint set is entailed by the set of constraints {a mathematical formula}C1={A=cover(I,D),B=card(A),V ≤ B}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then for the model of Example 3 (depicted by {a mathematical formula}CM) we have the following rewrite:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">a set of constraints {a mathematical formula}C1;</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Example 13</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Assume we wish to solve the earlier model{a mathematical formula} where the available algorithms are the LCM and FPGrowth specialized itemset mining algorithms, the maxsup and frequency specialized algorithms and the Gecode generic CP system (in that order).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then these are the ranked execution plans: {a mathematical formula} In the above we assume that LCM and FPGrowth are aware of the redundant constraint minfreq_redundant.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">If not, there would be variants of each of the specialized and hybrid strategies with redundant constraints too (they would be ranked below their non-redundant equivalent as they would have more constraints for the CP system).</a>
