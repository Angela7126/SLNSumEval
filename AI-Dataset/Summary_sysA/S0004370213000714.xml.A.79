<a href="#0" id="0">A transferable utility coalitional game Γ is composed of a set {a mathematical formula}I={a1, … ,an} of {a mathematical formula}|I|=n agents, and a characteristic function mapping any subset (coalition) of the agents to a real value {a mathematical formula}v Γ :2I → R, indicating the total utility that these agents achieve together.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By definition {a mathematical formula}p(C)= ∑ i ∈ Cpi, so finding the maximal excess coalition requires finding a subset of agents C whose skill set {a mathematical formula}S(C)= ⋃ i ∈ C ′ Si covers all skills S (i.e., {a mathematical formula} ⋃ i ∈ C ′ Si=S) and whose sum of payoffs {a mathematical formula}p(C)= ∑ i ∈ Cpi is minimal.</a>
