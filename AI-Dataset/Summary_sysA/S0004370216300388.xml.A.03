<a href="#0" id="0">In order to make their decisions, algorithm selection systems need information about the problem instance to solve and the performance of the algorithms in the given portfolio.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The extraction of this information — the features used by the machine learning techniques used for selection — incurs overhead not required when only a single algorithm is used for all instances regardless of instance characteristics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Algorithm configuration and selection are complementary since configuration can identify algorithms with peak performance for homogeneous benchmarks and selection can then choose from among these specialized algorithms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We propose a data format specification for algorithm selection scenarios, i.e., instances of the per-instance algorithm selection problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Most of our scenarios were taken from publications that report performance improvements through algorithm selection and consist of algorithms where the virtual best solver (VBS){sup:5} is significantly better than the single best solver.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The performance of each algorithm selection model was compared to the virtual best solver (VBS) and the single best solver.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In most cases, the algorithm selection approaches performed better than the single best solver.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, exploratory studies with various algorithm selection approaches demonstrated the performance that algorithm selection systems can achieve on our scenarios.</a>
