<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}(s ′ ,Y ′ ,a,(Y,W,R,A)) are also in {a mathematical formula}S ˜ wcs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Similarly, for every enabled action in state {a mathematical formula}(s,(Y,W,R,A)) we have that for all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ Y, if {a mathematical formula}W(s)=1 and {a mathematical formula}R(s)=1, then {a mathematical formula}r(s,a)=1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, all the rewards {a mathematical formula}r¯ from states in {a mathematical formula}S ˜ wcs are 1, and all the intermediate states {a mathematical formula}(s ′ ,Y ′ ,a,(Y,W,R,A)) have reward 1 by definition.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This all together ensures that after reaching the set {a mathematical formula}S ˜ wcs only rewards 1 are received, and as the set {a mathematical formula}S ˜ wcs is reached with probability 1, it follows by Lemma 1 that {a mathematical formula} Σ ˜ is an almost-sure winning strategy in the POMDP {a mathematical formula}G¯ for the {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 objective.</a>
