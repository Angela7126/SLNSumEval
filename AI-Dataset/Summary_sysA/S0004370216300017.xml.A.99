<a href="#0" id="0">Now, we define the generating relation ↝ on the set comprising {a mathematical formula}ind(K) and {a mathematical formula} Ω T, which is the set of all pairs of the form {a mathematical formula}([R], Τ ), for a role R in {a mathematical formula}T and {a mathematical formula} Τ ∈ type(T).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For {a mathematical formula}a ∈ ind(K) and {a mathematical formula}([R1], Τ 1),([R2], Τ 2) ∈ Ω T, we set{a mathematical formula} The generating structure{a mathematical formula}G=( Δ G, ⋅ G, ↝ ) is defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that the {a mathematical formula}Ci arrows point towards the root, in the opposite direction to the {a mathematical formula}Ci arrows of {a mathematical formula}M2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, there is a finite {a mathematical formula}( Σ ,{a})-homomorphism from {a mathematical formula}M2 into {a mathematical formula}M1 if and only if one of the clauses is false under each of the assignments (that is, iff Φ is unsatisfiable).The generating structure {a mathematical formula}G1 is essentially a set of loops each of which is missing precisely one of the {a mathematical formula}Ci.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, the responses of player 1 correspond to the choices of the missing {a mathematical formula}Ci.</a>
