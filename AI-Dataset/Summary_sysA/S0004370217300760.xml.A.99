<a href="#0" id="0">The left side shows the constraints of agent {a mathematical formula}Ag, and the right side shows agent {a mathematical formula}Ag's {a mathematical formula}Local_Cost data structure as it evolves with every LB_Request message.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When agent {a mathematical formula}Ag receives the first message from {a mathematical formula}Aa containing the assignment {a mathematical formula}va=x it updates its data structure so that {a mathematical formula}Local_Costg(Aa,x)=4 and {a mathematical formula}Local_Costg(Aa,y)=1 directly from {a mathematical formula}Aa.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that agent {a mathematical formula}Ag has no Earlier Constrained Agent from {a mathematical formula}Aa since it is the root agent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This means that {a mathematical formula}Aa is the first agent in the {a mathematical formula}Local_Costg data structure.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Agent {a mathematical formula}Ag sends a LB_Report(1) message to {a mathematical formula}Aa since 1 is the minimal cost in the relevant row.</a>
