<a href="#0" id="0">For {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ X, {a mathematical formula}S − is the set of arguments {a mathematical formula}{x: ∃ y ∈ S s.t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">(x,y) ∈ A} and, similarly, {a mathematical formula}S+ contains {a mathematical formula}{x: ∃ y ∈ S s.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In less formal terms, this assumption states that every simple cycle in {a mathematical formula}H(V) uses at least two distinct values.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Firstly {a mathematical formula}pr-vaf is not cf-preserving (for conflict-freeness in the standard sense): as observed above, we may have {a mathematical formula}S=P(H(V), Α ) for some Α – hence {a mathematical formula}S ∈ Epr-vaf(H(V)) – and {a mathematical formula}(x,y) ∈ A for {a mathematical formula}{x,y} ⊆ S.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our complexity analysis showed that ideal reasoning in these instantiations is of the same complexity as skeptical reasoning, which is in contrast to the standard ideal semantics, where reasoning is known to be in {a mathematical formula} Θ 2P[25] and thus easier than the {a mathematical formula} Π 2P-hard problem of skeptical reasoning (for preferred semantics); see also Table 2.</a>
