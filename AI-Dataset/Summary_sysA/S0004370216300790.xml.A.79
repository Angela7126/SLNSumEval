<a href="#0" id="0">1 illustrates this context: the human and the robot share a common space and exchange information through multiple modalities (we specifically consider verbal communication, deictic gestures and social gaze), and the robot is expected to achieve interactive object manipulation, fetch and carry tasks and other similar chores by taking into account, at every stage, the intentions, beliefs, perspectives, skills of its human partner.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We rely however on this mechanism in certain cases: some modules like the natural language processor use the short term memory profile to mark concepts that are currently manipulated by the robot as active concepts: if a human asks the robot “ Give me all red objects ” , the human, the Give action, and every red objects that are found are marked as active concepts by inserting statements such as 〈 HUMAN type ActiveConcept 〉 in the short-term memory (which can be considered, in this case, to be a working memory).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We first discuss how embodied cognition is an essential challenge in human – robot interaction; we rephrase then the requirements of joint actions in terms of five questions; we discuss the importance of building and maintaining a multi-level model of the human; and we finally reflect on the importance of explicit knowledge management in robotic architectures that deal with human-level semantics and state in that respect the current limits of our logic framework.</a>
