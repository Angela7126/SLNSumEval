<a href="#0" id="0">A planning problem {a mathematical formula}P ˜ with respect to an incomplete domain model {a mathematical formula}D ˜ and a set of typed objects O is defined as {a mathematical formula}P ˜ = 〈 F,A,I,G 〉 where F is the set of propositions instantiated from predicates {a mathematical formula}R and objects O, A is the set of actions instantiated from {a mathematical formula}O and O, {a mathematical formula}I ⊆ F is the initial state, and {a mathematical formula}G ⊆ F is the set of goal propositions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The resulting state after executing a sequence of actions Π in a state s under a complete model {a mathematical formula}D ∈ 《 D ˜ 》 is denoted by {a mathematical formula} Γ D( Π ,s).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The projection of Π in s with respect to the incomplete model {a mathematical formula}D ˜ , {a mathematical formula} Γ ( Π ,s), is defined as the union of all projection of Π from s with respect to each and every complete models in {a mathematical formula} 《 D ˜ 》 :{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula} Σ Π be the set of all constraints above.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For each assignment Σ for variables Z, we denote {a mathematical formula}D Σ ∈ 《 D ˜ 》 as the candidate domain model in which the realization of possible preconditions and effects is determined by the truth assignment for variables {a mathematical formula}Z ˜ in Σ .</a>
