<a href="#1" id="1">The idea behind the framework is simple: we draw a relation between two arguments iff they do not occur jointly in any set {a mathematical formula}S ∈ S.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Stable semantics are the only semantics that can realize {a mathematical formula}S= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that {a mathematical formula}S= ∅ is easily stb-realizable, for instance with the framework {a mathematical formula}({a},{(a,a)}).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Proposition 1 the only difference between stable and stage semantics was the case {a mathematical formula}S= ∅ .</a>
