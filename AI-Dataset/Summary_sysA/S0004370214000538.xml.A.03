<a href="#0" id="0">More specifically, we prove that the performance regret (i.e., the difference between the performance of a particular algorithm and that of the optimal solution) of the bounded Ε -first approach is at most {a mathematical formula}O(B23) with a high probability, where B is the total budget.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When used together with the uniform exploration technique described above, we refer to this algorithm as bounded Ε -first, or {a mathematical formula}A Ε -first.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By setting the exploration budget to be{a mathematical formula}B Ε opt, with at least probability Β , the regret of the bounded Ε -first algorithm is at most{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular, for any {a mathematical formula}0< Α <1, there is a sufficiently large {a mathematical formula}B0 such that for any budget size {a mathematical formula}B>B0, the performance of our algorithm for that budget size is guaranteed to be better than an Α -ratio of the optimal solution.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">With at least probability Β , the performance regret of the bounded Ε -first with SR exploration approach is at most{a mathematical formula}In addition, by optimally tuning Ε , we can show that the regret is at most{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that for {a mathematical formula}N ≥ 9, this regret bound is clearly worse than that of the Ε -first approach with uniform exploration (see Eq.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">As we can see from the results, our algorithm typically outperforms the existing algorithms by up to {a mathematical formula}78%.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In particular, it outperforms the budget-limited Ε -first by {a mathematical formula}23% in the case of a small budget ({a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 for the budget-limited algorithm).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, if the budget is higher than $100, our algorithm clearly outperforms the others by up to {a mathematical formula}67%.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In addition, our algorithm outperforms the others by up to {a mathematical formula}162% (for the case of budget {a mathematical formula}B=$10,000).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However, it can still only achieve less than {a mathematical formula}60% of the bounded Ε -first.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We now turn to the investigation of whether we can improve the performance of the bounded Ε -first algorithm by replacing the uniform exploration approach with other policies.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We proved that this algorithm has an {a mathematical formula}O(B23) theoretical upper bound for its performance regret.</a>
