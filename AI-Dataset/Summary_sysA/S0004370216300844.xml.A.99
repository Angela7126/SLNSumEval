<a href="#0" id="0">Assume first that {a mathematical formula}(H, ℓ ) is a yes-instance and let S be an independent set of size ℓ in H. Then, merging all articles of S into one article in the Cautious H-Index Manipulation instance is valid since the compatibility graph G is a clique.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Furthermore, it yields a merged article S with {a mathematical formula}unionCite(S) ≥ h citations: Since the vertices in S are independent in G, there is no article {a mathematical formula}e{u,v} citing both {a mathematical formula}u,v ∈ S in the Cautious H-Index Manipulation instance.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, the citations of the articles in S are pairwise disjoint.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Together with the {a mathematical formula}h − 1 atomic articles in {a mathematical formula}W ≥ we have H-index h.Conversely, assume that {a mathematical formula}(D,G,W,h, ℓ − 1) is a yes-instance.</a>
