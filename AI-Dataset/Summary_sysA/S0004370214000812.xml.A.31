<a href="#1" id="1">Our proposed concept of the most influential individuals is illustrated in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">1 with a very simple example.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Yet, out of purely scientific curiosity and suggestions/feedback about our work, we present preliminary results based on a heuristic for the problem of most influential nodes in our context (i.e., LIGs) that we designed by adapting what is arguably the most popular and simple greedy-selection algorithm for identifying “ most influential ” nodes developed specifically for the cascade model of diffusion [49].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The simplicity of the original algorithm in the diffusion context facilitates the adaptation to our context.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note however that this adaptation is exclusive to a very specific instance of our general problem formulation: identifying “ most influential nodes ” with respect to the goal being maximizing the number of +1's in the PSNE (see Definition 3.6 in Section 3.2 for a definition and discussion of our problem formulation and the role that the “ objective function ” {a mathematical formula}g(.)</a>
