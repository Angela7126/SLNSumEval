<a href="#0" id="0">We note that given our assumption that workers do not collaborate, one might believe that the workers ʼ responses {a mathematical formula}bw are independent of each other given the true answer v. However, they are not because of the following subtlety.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Even though the different workers are not collaborating, a mistake by one worker changes the error probability of others, because a mistake gives evidence that the question may be intrinsically hard and hence, difficult for others to get it right as well.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, as shown in the graphical model, we make the assumption that the worker responses are independent of each other only after we are additionally given the difficulty d.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We first estimate the mean of worker w ʼ s improvement distribution, denoted by {a mathematical formula} Μ qw ′ (q).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We assume that {a mathematical formula} Μ qw ′ is a linear function of the quality of the original artifact.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{sup:15} By introducing {a mathematical formula} Μ Qw ′ , we separate the variance in a worker ʼ s ability in improving all artifacts of the same quality from the variance in our training data, which is due to her starting out from artifacts of different qualities.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In order to behave optimally, AgentHunt needs to learn all Γ values, average worker error parameters {a mathematical formula} Γ ¯, and the joint workflow difficulty prior Δ , which is a part of its initial belief.</a>
