<a href="#0" id="0">Comparing LARS to linear temporal logic, we see that the temporal operators are clearly different, The temporal operators □ and ◇ in LARS have as counterparts the pairs {a mathematical formula}G,G − 1 and {a mathematical formula}F,F − 1 respectively, which allow one to address all positions in a path; the past time operators are indispensable for evaluation inside the path.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Drawing from the observation about what operations are typically performed on windows in stream processing, we have considered the temporal modalities □ , ◇ and the nominal operator {a mathematical formula}@t; that is, LARS allows for distinguishing truth of a formula at (i) specific time points, but also (ii) at some respectively every time point in a window; furthermore, it offers general window operators that may be nested, which enables reasoning over streams within the language.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to make sure that this initial segment is minimal, i.e., consists only of position 0, we use a new atom {a mathematical formula}s ′ and state that {a mathematical formula}s ′ must also form an initial segment in every model I, and moreover one that is contained in the segment of s:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} To ensure the minimality of the segment for s, we add a constraint which excludes that the segment for {a mathematical formula}s ′ is a proper subsegment:{a mathematical formula} As {a mathematical formula}s ′ occurs only in the rules (44) – (47), minimality and supportedness of answer streams (Theorem 1, Theorem 2) imply that in any answer stream I of the resulting program {a mathematical formula}PA ′ for S at t, the atom {a mathematical formula}s ′ (and thus also s) must be present at position 0 and only there.Formally, it can be shown that {a mathematical formula}PA ′ has an answer stream for {a mathematical formula}S=(T, Υ ), {a mathematical formula}T=[0,t], at t iff S correctly encodes a string {a mathematical formula} Σ 0 Σ 1 ⋯ Σ t from {a mathematical formula} Σ ⁎ and A accepts {a mathematical formula} Σ 0 Σ 1 ⋯ Σ t.</a>
