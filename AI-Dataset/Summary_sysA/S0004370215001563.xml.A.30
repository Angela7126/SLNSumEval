<a href="#0" id="0">for every program state {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V, we define a propositional formula {a mathematical formula}reqv= ⋁ 〈 v, 〈 Γ , Ψ , Φ 〉 ,v ′ 〉 ∈ Δ req Γ : Ψ , Φ v,v ′ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That is, {a mathematical formula}reqv states that (at least) one transition among those available in the state v of the planning program is currently requested.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A planning problem with action costs is a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 D,s0, Ψ , Φ ,c 〉 where {a mathematical formula}D= 〈 P,A, Τ 〉 is a deterministic planning domain, {a mathematical formula}s0 is the initial state, {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∈ Φ (P) is a maintenance goal, {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Φ (P) is an achievement goal; and {a mathematical formula}c:A ↦ R is an action cost function.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We will say that W represents domain state {a mathematical formula}W[s], planning program state {a mathematical formula}W[v], transition {a mathematical formula}W[d], and action {a mathematical formula}W[a] (or, alternatively, that these are represented in W).</a>
