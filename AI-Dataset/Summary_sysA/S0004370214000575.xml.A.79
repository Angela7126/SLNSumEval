<a href="#0" id="0">Agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's strategy can thus be represented as the mapping {a mathematical formula}S(v,j) → pij(v), where {a mathematical formula}pij(v) is the probability that {a mathematical formula}Ai will choose to explore an additional opportunity when the number of remaining allowed searches is j and the best value obtained so far by all agents is v. We use {a mathematical formula}EBij(v) to denote the expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai if it follows the optimal search strategy, given the strategies used by the other agents, with j search opportunities remaining, and the best value obtained through all the agents' searches so far is v.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then we continue with an inductive proof, showing that if the reservation value calculated according to (5) is indeed the optimal strategy for any number of available opportunities {a mathematical formula}n ″ >n ′ then this reservation value should also be used when the number of available opportunities is {a mathematical formula}n ′ .In the absence of any other new information along the search process, agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's strategy is the mapping {a mathematical formula}S(x → ,n ′ ) → {terminate,resume}, where {a mathematical formula}x → is the set of values obtained so far and {a mathematical formula}n ′ is the number of potential remaining search periods.</a>
