<a href="#0" id="0">Thus, the semantic of the problem remains the same while the global view of the AllDifferent constraints is lost.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that, we no longer use {a mathematical formula}LB ≠ as an initial lower bound, because it corresponds to the size of the largest AllDifferent constraint.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given this new model, we compare the number of optima respectively proved by {a mathematical formula} ↑ AMNV 〈 GCI|MD,Rk|R1,3 〉 ⁎ and {a mathematical formula} ↑ AMNV 〈 GCI|MD,Rk|R1,3,4 〉 ⁎ , for different values of k, after a resolution of 5 minutes (Fig.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">As justified in Section 3.5, {a mathematical formula}R4 calls the AllDifferent BC filtering algorithm on every independent set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We now evaluate the ability of our approach to provide good bounds even on large scale instances.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For that, we evaluate the relative gap {a mathematical formula}(z¯ – z ̲ )/z¯ depending on the running model.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Both MIP model and CP model are run with a time limit of 6 minutes.</a>
