<a href="#0" id="0">This points to one of the fundamental differences between heuristic and algorithmic teaching guidance.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Heuristic teaching guidance is not as effective as algorithmic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We find that the learning curves obtained with heuristic teaching guidance are not as good as the ones obtained with algorithmic teaching guidance in Experiment 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For instance, one participant describes his strategy as follows: “ Give the machine a few examples of alpha, then a few examples of obviously not alpha, then test close to but not quite cases of alpha in order to fill the gap. ” This demonstrates that the heuristic is intuitive for human teachers; however, it is less likely to be used without explicit guidance.</a>
