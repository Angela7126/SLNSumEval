<a href="#0" id="0">In this section we will establish the following three results for finite-memory strategies: (i) we show that in POMDPs with {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 objectives belief-support-based strategies are not sufficient for almost-sure winning; (ii) we establish an exponential upper bound on the memory required by an almost-sure winning strategy for {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 objectives; and (iii) we show that the decision problem is EXPTIME-complete.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our improved algorithm consists of two steps: (i) first we construct a special type of a belief-observation POMDP; and we show that there exists a finite-memory almost-sure winning strategy for the objective {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 iff there exists a randomized memoryless almost-sure winning strategy in the belief-observation POMDP for the {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 objective; and (ii) then we show how to determine whether there exists a randomized memoryless almost-sure winning strategy in the belief-observation POMDP for the {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 objective in polynomial time with respect to the size of the belief-observation POMDP.</a>
