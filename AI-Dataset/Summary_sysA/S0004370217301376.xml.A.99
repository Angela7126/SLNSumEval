<a href="#0" id="0">The formula {a mathematical formula}KiE □ ip is true in {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and false in {a mathematical formula}(M ′ ,s ′ ): these states are not modally equivalent in the logic of implicit knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">But these epistemic awareness states are p awareness bisimilar and therefore modally equivalent in the language {a mathematical formula}L(KE,A).To prove that {a mathematical formula}LE ∼ S5AILS, first note that Lemma 41 establishing {a mathematical formula}LE ⪯ LS does not depend on frame properties of epistemic awareness models and therefore also applies under the restriction to class {a mathematical formula}S5AI.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In such models awareness can be defined in terms of explicit knowledge (as also done in [28]) as {a mathematical formula}A Φ ↔ (KE Φ ∨ KE¬KE Φ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In a setting like [6], only {a mathematical formula}A Φ ↔ KE( Φ ∨ ¬ Φ ) holds.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We recall (see the proof of Proposition 53) that on {a mathematical formula}S5AI, awareness is not definable as {a mathematical formula}Ai Φ ↔ (KiS Φ ∨ KiS¬KSi Φ ) in the logic of speculative knowledge, but has to be defined as {a mathematical formula}Ai Φ ↔ ⋀ p ∈ v( Φ )(KiSp ∨ KiS¬KiSp).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Although the above works therefore contain many expressivity results, expressivity as such was not their focus (but axiomatization).</a>
