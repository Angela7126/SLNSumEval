<a href="#0" id="0">It is easy to see that each solution that assigns the K universally top-ranked alternatives to the agents is optimal.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus the total dissatisfaction of the agents in the optimal solution is:{a mathematical formula} By taking large enough m and K (even for a fixed value of {a mathematical formula}mK), the fraction {a mathematical formula}1 − K − 12(m − 1) can be arbitrarily close to the approximation ratio of our algorithm (the reasoning here is somewhat in the spirit of the idea of identifying maximally robust elections, as studied by Shiryaev, Yu, and Elkind [53]).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If all the agents in {a mathematical formula}Ni were assigned to alternatives from {a mathematical formula}A2, then, by the construction of R, at least one of them would have been assigned to an alternative that she ranks at a position greater than {a mathematical formula} ‖ A2 ‖ − ⌈ m(1+r)K ⌉ K= ⌈ 2r ⌉ ⌈ m(1+r)K ⌉ K − ⌈ m(1+r)K ⌉ K.</a>
