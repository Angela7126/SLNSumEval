<a href="#0" id="0">Let Ψ : {a mathematical formula}S×A → S map an observed robot's transition from state s given action a to a particular next state, {a mathematical formula}s ′ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This approach requires that Ψ is known to the learning agent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An added bonus is if the precise error model is also known to the learner although this is challenging in the context of robotics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Despite this, not knowing the probability of the expert reaching its intended state is a significant relaxation of the requirement by existing IRL methods that the full stochastic transition function inclusive of all probabilities be known.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Indeed, in domains involving mobile robots where the actions taken correspond to movement, {a mathematical formula} Ψ (s,a) may be determined accurately and we follow this approach in our experimentation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Section 5.6 will explore the error model in more detail.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, we presented a method for inversely learning the partial transition functions of other agents in the presence of limited observations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our model is applicable to contexts where the transitions of the agent may be attributed to independent underlying components or features that must all function properly for the agent to arrive at an intended state.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As the interactions are sparse, the transition probabilities of the multiple observed robots are assumed to be conditionally independent of each other; we may assume locality.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The locality can be relaxed by allowing joint actions in {a mathematical formula}TI and {a mathematical formula} Ψ I thereby mapping state and joint actions to features.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Robust evaluations of the methods demonstrated that the dynamics may be learned accurately.</a>
