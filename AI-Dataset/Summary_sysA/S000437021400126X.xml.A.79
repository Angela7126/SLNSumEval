<a href="#0" id="0">In fact, {a mathematical formula}2n+1 is the worst-case bound we obtain, and for most problem instances with more than 1001 regions, the methodology from Section 5 will still allow us to derive that convex solutions in {a mathematical formula}Rn must exist.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">There exists a consistent atomic RCC8 network over{a mathematical formula}{EC,DC}which has no convex solution in{a mathematical formula}R2.Consider the consistent atomic RCC8 network Θ containing the following constraints:{a mathematical formula} as well as the constraint xDCy for every pair of variables {a mathematical formula}(x,y) from {a mathematical formula}{a,b,c,u,v,w} which does not appear in the list above.Assuming that a convex solution {a mathematical formula}S of Θ in the plane exists, we can draw {a mathematical formula}K3,3 as follows.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For every{a mathematical formula}n ≥ 1there exists a consistent atomic RCC5 network Θ over{a mathematical formula}{DR,PO,PP,PP − 1}which has no convex solution in{a mathematical formula}Rn.Let {a mathematical formula}n ≥ 1 be arbitrary and consider the following set of RCC5 constraints Θ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In [23] it was shown that deciding whether a set of RCC8 constraints has a convex solution in {a mathematical formula}R2 is as hard as deciding the consistency of a set of algebraic equations (of similar size) over the real numbers.</a>
