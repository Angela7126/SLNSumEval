<a href="#0" id="0">Though learning the merge function directly allows us to recover the dendrogram easily, it is difficult to define an objective around it.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While global {a mathematical formula}cannot – link or {a mathematical formula}must – link constraints have been shown to improve the performance of hierarchical clustering, they were designed for flat clustering and do not take into account the hierarchical nature of a dendrogram.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Another constraint type that was specifically devised for hierarchical clustering is the {a mathematical formula}must – link – before (MLB) constraints [23].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In some ways this constraint is less powerful than local {a mathematical formula}must – link constraints because they only specifies the relative ordering of how points should be merged.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However in practice local constraints are difficult to specify whereas it is generally easy to specify a {a mathematical formula}must – link – before constraint.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As Equation (11) shows, the definition of {a mathematical formula}MLB(a,b,c) is that points a and b must be merged before a and c or b and c.{a mathematical formula}</a>
