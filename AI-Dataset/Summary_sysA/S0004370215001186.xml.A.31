<a href="#1" id="1">Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">14 shows the average number of encounters during 100 independent simulation runs for scale-free networks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">(We don't include the configuration for one network and {a mathematical formula}d=1 because these never converge.)</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The convergence ratio is very low for the configurations with one network {a mathematical formula}d=2 and 2 networks with {a mathematical formula}d=1; hence the high number of encounters (see also Table 3).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We first look at the influence of the new parameter (switching probability) in the convergence to consensus.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We span the switching probability between 0 and 1 in intervals of 0.05.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We do this for 2 networks with k-regular and scale-free topologies.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">16 shows the results for two k-regular networks: one configuration with {a mathematical formula}k=10 and one configuration with {a mathematical formula}k=30.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this case it is more important (to convergence speed) to switch from the network with lower average path length and a forest-like composition (and a probability of at least the same value or more than the one of the other network with {a mathematical formula}d=5).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The same can be observed when we mix k-regular with scale-free networks (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">19).</a>
