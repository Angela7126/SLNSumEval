<a href="#0" id="0">This result closes the fixed-parameter complexity analysis of the optimal strategy selection problem in limids in what regards the topology of the diagram, the number of values nodes, and the cardinality of the variables: polytree-shaped limids with binary variables and a single value node can be solved in polynomial time, and relaxing any of these assumptions leads to NP-hard problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To show that the optimal strategy selection problem is NP-hard, we shall design a family of polytree-shaped limids over binary variables such that for each instance {a mathematical formula}z1, … ,zn of the partition problem there is a limid in the family whose size is polynomial in b (the size of the partition problem) and satisfies {a mathematical formula}max Δ E[U| Δ ] ⩾ 0 if and only if {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1nzi Δ i/z=1 for some solution Δ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The next lemma shows that for any partition problem the expected utility of a strategy differs from (5) by at most {a mathematical formula}2 − 9b.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">According to Proposition 2, for any instance of the partition problem we can build in polynomial time a polytree-shaped influence diagram of bounded treewidth with only binary variables and such that the partition problem has a yes-solution if and only the optimum strategy has non-negative expected utility.</a>
