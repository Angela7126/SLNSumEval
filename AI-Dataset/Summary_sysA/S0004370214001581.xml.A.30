<a href="#0" id="0">A red – black finite-domain representation ({a mathematical formula}RB) planning task is given by a quintuple {a mathematical formula} Π = 〈 VB,VR,A,I,G 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}VB and {a mathematical formula}VR are sets of finite-domain state variables, called black variables and red variables, respectively, and A, I, and G are exactly as in {a mathematical formula}FDR and {a mathematical formula}MFDR tasks, specified with respect to the union of the black and red variables.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Any RSE-invertible {a mathematical formula}RB task with acyclic black causal graph is reversible.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Whenever the black precondition of the next action (or, at the end, the goal) is not satisfied, we project the planning task onto the black variables, and then project these variables' domains onto the values already visited along our red – black plan prefix.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We then solve this projected task to move the black variables into place.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The projected tasks have black variables only, so are in {a mathematical formula}FDR.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Their causal graph is acyclic because the black causal graph of the original task Π is.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">returning {a mathematical formula}hrepairRB(s):= ∞ if no relaxed plan exists and hence (by Corollary 1) no red – black plan exists either,</a>
