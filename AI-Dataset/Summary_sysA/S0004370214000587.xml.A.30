<a href="#0" id="0">Given a target image B and a source image A, the fractal encoding algorithm seeks to discover this particular set of transformations T.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The partitioning scheme P extracts a set of images {a mathematical formula}bi from the target image B.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The next step of the algorithm is to perform a systematic examination of the source image A for fragments of A that can be said to best match a particular image {a mathematical formula}bi.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this example, the problem is to determine for which of the candidate images the transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ is made most analogous to transformation T. We first will represent T as a fractal representation, and then generate a set of candidate transformations Ω as shown in Fig.</a>
