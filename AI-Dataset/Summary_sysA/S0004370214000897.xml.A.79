<a href="#0" id="0">We also require that the complete mechanism is individually rational: every agent's expected utility after redistribution must be nonnegative ({a mathematical formula}aivi − ti+R(v − i) ≥ 0).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That is, {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ is an upper bound on the competitive ratio of any complete mechanism whose allocation part is linear.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the following theorem, we show that this upper bound can be achieved: we construct a complete mechanism whose allocation part is linear, and prove that this mechanism has a competitive ratio of {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In what follows, we construct a complete mechanism whose allocation part is within the family under consideration, and prove that this mechanism has a competitive ratio of {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">That is, we need to prove that the constructed mechanism satisfies individual rationality, the non-deficit constraint, and the competitive ratio constraint (it is obvious that the constraints involving only the {a mathematical formula}pi hold).According to the definition of the linear allocation mechanisms, both {a mathematical formula}EM(V) and {a mathematical formula}PM(V) are continuous in the elements in V. We have also proved that the constructed {a mathematical formula}R ⁎ is continuous in the elements in V. We now consider the constraints in the optimization model that are related to the redistribution rule.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since we are considering an arbitrary agent and an arbitrary type profile, we have that the {a mathematical formula}ai characterize the agents' payments, and thus characterize the entire mechanism (because the {a mathematical formula}ai also characterize the allocation).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The agents' total welfare under the first-best mechanism is simply m. Therefore, whether the marginal values are assumed to be nonincreasing or not, any partitioning-based mechanism is at most {a mathematical formula}n − 1n-competitive.Given any type profile, let S denote the set of agents that win something under the first-best mechanism.</a>
