<a href="#0" id="0">Next, in Section 7, we consider approximation algorithms for OWA-Winner for the case where agents have non-finicky utilities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is easy to note that for K-best OWA (that is, for the family of constant OWAs {a mathematical formula} Α =(1, … ,1)) the problem is in P.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Proof</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For every Ε we show a polynomial-time algorithm with approximation ratio {a mathematical formula}(1 − Ε ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider some Ε , {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ Ε ≤ 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">There exists a value {a mathematical formula}K Ε such that for each {a mathematical formula}K>K Ε it holds that {a mathematical formula} ℓ exp ⁡ ( − Γ K ℓ 2)< Ε .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For each instance I of Α -OWA-Winner where we seek winner set of size at least {a mathematical formula}K Ε , we run the algorithm from Theorem 29.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the remaining cases, where the winner-set size is bounded by a constant, we use a brute-force algorithm.</a>
