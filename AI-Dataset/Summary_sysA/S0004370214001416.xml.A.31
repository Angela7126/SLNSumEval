<a href="#0" id="0">After learning the parametrization Θ of value function approximation, we can plan trajectories using greedy policy {a mathematical formula} Π :S → A induced by the approximated value function, V,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}D(s,a) is the sampled state resulting from applying action a to a state s. When applied to the system, the resulting action moves the system to the state associated with the highest estimated value.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The algorithm starts with an arbitrary initial state.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then it finds an action according to (3).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The action is used to transition to the next state.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The process repeats until the goal is reached or the trajectory exceeds a maximum number of steps.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Proposition 3.1 gives sufficient conditions that the state-value function approximation, action state space and system dynamics need to meet to guarantee a plan that leads to the goal state.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The action selection step, or the policy, becomes the search for action that transitions the system to the highest valued state chosen from the {a mathematical formula}As subset,{a mathematical formula} The policy given in (7) ensures state transitions in the vicinity of the reference path P. If it is not possible to transition the system within given ideal proximity Δ , the algorithm selects k closest positions and selects an action that produces the best minimal residual oscillations characteristics upon transition (see Algorithm 1).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Varying Δ , which is the desired error margin, controls how close we desire the system to be to the reference path.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Parameter k gives the weight to whether we prefer the proximity to the reference trajectory, or load displacement reduction.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Choosing very small k and Δ results in trajectories that are as close to the reference trajectory as the system dynamics allows, at the expense of the load swing.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Larger values of the parameters allow more deviation from the reference trajectory, and better load displacement results.</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">8 presents results of the path-following and load displacement errors for the line and helix reference paths.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We compare them to path-following only and minimal residual oscillations AVI algorithms.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Fig.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">8a displays the trajectories.</a>
