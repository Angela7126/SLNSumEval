<a href="#0" id="0">Additionally, we include new comprehensive results about what effect the degree of similarity between CAD model and actual object has on the quality of the final pose estimation, and we apply the method to a full scene point cloud using a 6D SLAM algorithm.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">[19] build a semantic map based on the detection of furniture parts in a set of 3D point clouds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">CAD models have been used for object recognition before.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">[26] use CAD models to create synthetic point clouds of several types of furniture and extract geometric features which are used to build a vocabulary of objects via machine learning techniques.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since ICP needs two point clouds as input, we create a surface sampling of the CAD model to fulfill the algorithm's requirements.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To investigate how robust our ICP matching step is with respect to such differences between CAD model and actual object, we conducted an experiment where we matched several CAD models of chairs against recorded point data of a chair.</a>
