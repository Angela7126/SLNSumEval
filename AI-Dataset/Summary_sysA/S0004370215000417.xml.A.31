<a href="#0" id="0">This paper introduces cutting plane extensions to the method for learning Bayesian networks using Integer Linear Programming presented in Section 2.2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A major issue identified there was of identifying and adding cutting planes in an effective manner.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As with many other aspects of ILP solving, SCIP features a number of built-in general purpose cutting plane finding algorithms some of which are examined in Section 5.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition to these, the cluster constraints for ruling out cycles in the network are added as cutting planes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Second, new classes of constraints are introduced which any valid integer solution must obey.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These form the complete set of tightest possible constraints for the problem with 3 or 4 nodes, but as with the original acyclicity constraints, the issue of which to add and when proves critical to their success in assisting with solving larger problems.</a>
