<a href="#0" id="0">Verification of cryptographic algorithms by Aaron Tomb These benchmarks are derived from the problem of comparing reference and production implementations of cryptographic algorithms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since the number of available benchmark problems for SAT solving is huge while computational resources are limited it is necessary to somehow select a subset of the instances to be used for a competition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to make CryptoMiniSat adaptive, the top 5 parameter configurations were experimentally determined and then a classifier has been trained with benchmark problems from the previous SAT Competitions to select the best configuration for the problem at hand.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The success of this method might be due to the strong connection between blocked clauses and functional dependencies among variables [27] and it shows that structure based solving can elevate performance of SAT solvers considerably.</a>
