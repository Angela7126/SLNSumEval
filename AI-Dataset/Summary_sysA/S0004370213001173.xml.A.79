<a href="#0" id="0">Both the refinement and adaptation mechanisms can be designed through an approach based on our vision, where the HOM facility is an actor that can be organized into a hierarchy of reasoning functions, where each abstract action can be a task to be further refined and planned for, and where online planning and acting are performed continually in order to adapt and repair plans.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Making the right predictions from the combined models of actions and skills, as well as from additional models of the environment, is a difficult problem that involves heterogeneous representations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, autonomous acting requires extended perception capabilities: sensing actions as well as querying and information gathering steps, combined into a consistent interpretation of the environment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">They include in particular AI problems such as anchoring and symbol grounding (i.e., establish, maintain and revise signals-to-symbols relations), reasoning on what is observable and what is not, integrating knowledge-gathering actions to environment changing actions, acting in order to maintain a consistent interpretation of self and the world, dynamic situation and plan-recognition problems.</a>
