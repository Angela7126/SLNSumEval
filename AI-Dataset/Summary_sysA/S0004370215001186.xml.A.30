<a href="#0" id="0">In this article, we explore the modelling of opinion dynamics with multiple social networks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We look at how the properties of different network models influence the convergence to opinion consensus.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We present a series of models that use these networks in different ways: which create distinct emergent dynamics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We want to study the consequences of using multiple social networks at the same time while maintaining the interaction model as simple and abstract as possible (following the methodology in most opinion dynamics literature).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the next section, we present the work related to opinion dynamics, social space modelling and complex network models.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this section, we present work related to opinion dynamics, social space modelling, and complex network models.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">4 shows the average value for the average path length of 100 k-regular network instances (each with 100 nodes).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We can see that the average path length changes more drastically when we go from 1 to 2 networks.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">Future work includes the analysis of different complex network models.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">While k-regular and scale-free networks are two of the most pervasive network examples in social simulation, there has been a growing number of models with different properties inspired by real-world phenomena that can be considered.</a>
