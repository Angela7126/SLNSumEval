<a href="#1" id="1">The coalition structure generation problem is to find an optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ ∈ Π A, i.e., an (arbitrary) element of the set{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Definition 5</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a coalition {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ A, a subset of movements {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M and two partitions {a mathematical formula} Π , Π ′ ∈ Π C, we say that {a mathematical formula} Π ′ is reachable from Π via M, and write {a mathematical formula} Π ⇝ M Π ′ , if and only if {a mathematical formula} Π ′ is either equal to Π , or can be reached from Π via one or more movements in M. More formally,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">According to Corollary 7, given a subset of movements M, {a mathematical formula}DPM finds an optimal coalition structure if and only if {a mathematical formula}RM{A}= Π A.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We will now identify a “ small ” set of movements M for which this is the case.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Recall that, given two coalitions {a mathematical formula}C ′ ,C ″ ∈ CA, we write {a mathematical formula}C ′ <C ″ if and only if {a mathematical formula}C ′ precedes {a mathematical formula}C ″ lexicographically.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{sup:6} Set{a mathematical formula} It turns out that, to find an optimal partition, it suffices to consider the movements in {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Every movement {a mathematical formula}mC ′ ,C ″ ∈ M ⁎ with {a mathematical formula}C ′ ∪ C ″ =A leads to exactly one coalition structure, namely {a mathematical formula}{C ′ ,C ″ }, which is in {a mathematical formula} Π 2A.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Similarly, every coalition structure {a mathematical formula}{C1,C2} ∈ Π 2A is reachable via exactly one movement in {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ , namely {a mathematical formula}mC1,C2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between {a mathematical formula} Π 2A and {a mathematical formula}{mC ′ ,C ″ ∈ M ⁎ :C ′ ∪ C ″ =A}.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">By making a movement from a coalition structure CS to a coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ′ in the coalition structure graph, DP makes a movement from the integer partition I with {a mathematical formula}CS ∈ Π IA to the integer partition {a mathematical formula}I ′ with {a mathematical formula}CS ′ ∈ Π I ′ A in the integer partition graph.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For example, the movement from {a mathematical formula}{{a1},{a2,a3,a4}} to {a mathematical formula}{{a1},{a2},{a3,a4}} in Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">5(B) corresponds to the movement from {a mathematical formula} Π {1,3}A to {a mathematical formula} Π {1,1,2}A in Fig.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">5(A).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">5.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Compute the value of {a mathematical formula}{C1,C2} ∪ ai ∈ A ∖ (C1 ∪ C2){{ai}} — the only coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π I5A that contains {a mathematical formula}C1 and {a mathematical formula}C2.</a>
