<a href="#0" id="0">We summarize the temporal properties of crowd flows into three categories, consisting of temporal closeness, period, and trend.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">ST-ResNet uses three different residual networks to model these properties, respectively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), like long-short term memory (LSTM), is capable of learning long-range temporal dependencies.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Using RNNs, however, to model temporal period and trend, it needs very long input sequences (e.g.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}length=1344),{sup:4} which makes the whole training process non-trivial (see Section 5.2 for empirical evaluation).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">According to the ST domain knowledge, we know that only a few previous keyframes influence the next keyframe.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, we leverage temporal closeness, period, trend to select keyframes for modeling.</a>
