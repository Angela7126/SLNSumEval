<a href="#0" id="0">A problem closely related to algorithm selection is the algorithm configuration problem: given a parameterized algorithm A, a set of problem instances I and a performance measure m, find a parameter setting of A that optimizes m on I (see [52] for a formal definition).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Some algorithm selectors do not select a single algorithm, but compute a schedule of several algorithms: they apply a to i for a resource budget {a mathematical formula}r âˆˆ R (e.g., CPU time), evaluate the performance metric, evaluate a stopping criterion, and repeat as necessary, taking observations made during the run of a into account.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To provide further insight into our algorithm selection scenarios, we applied forward selection [61] to the algorithms and features to determine whether smaller subsets still achieve comparable performance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We accept this caveat since our goal here is to study the ranking of the features and the size of the selected sets, and a more complex, nested approach would have resulted in multiple selected sets.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We carefully selected the set of scenarios included in release version 2.0 of ASlib to challenge algorithm selection methods in various ways and thus provide a solid basis for developing and assessing such methods.</a>
