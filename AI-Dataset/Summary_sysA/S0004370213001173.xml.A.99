<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:1} The importance of the acting part has been largely underestimated, and insufficient attention has been given to the numerous AI problems that emerge when attempting to integrate acting with planning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consequently, in contrast with successful AI fields such as machine learning, the deployment of automated planning techniques into fielded applications has remained relatively low despite its large potential.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Both the refinement and adaptation mechanisms can be designed through an approach based on our vision, where the HOM facility is an actor that can be organized into a hierarchy of reasoning functions, where each abstract action can be a task to be further refined and planned for, and where online planning and acting are performed continually in order to adapt and repair plans.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Making the right predictions from the combined models of actions and skills, as well as from additional models of the environment, is a difficult problem that involves heterogeneous representations.</a>
