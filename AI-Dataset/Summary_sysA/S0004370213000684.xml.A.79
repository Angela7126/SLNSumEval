<a href="#0" id="0">It is straightforward to get a result similar to Breiman ʼ s minimum margin bound in Theorem 2, by setting {a mathematical formula}k=1 in Eq.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is noteworthy that Theorem 8 shows that the generalization error can be bounded in term of the empirical margin distribution {a mathematical formula}PrS[yf(x) ⩽ Θ ], the training sample size and the hypothesis complexity; in other words, this bound considers exactly the same factors as Schapire et al.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This corollary shows that the bounds of Theorem 9 are {a mathematical formula}O(lnm/m), comparable to the Emargin bounds [44] and the bounds of Theorem 8, but with different constants.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For {a mathematical formula}Xi ∈ [0,1] and {a mathematical formula} Ξ m(X¯k,Y), it is easy to obtain the optimal solution by simple calculation{a mathematical formula} which yields that{a mathematical formula} For {a mathematical formula}Xi ∈ [0,1], it is obvious that{a mathematical formula} and from Lemma 7, we have{a mathematical formula} which yields that, for {a mathematical formula}m ⩾ 5,{a mathematical formula} Therefore, for any {a mathematical formula}t>0, the following holds by using Lemma 6 to {a mathematical formula} Ξ m(X¯),{a mathematical formula} Setting {a mathematical formula} Δ =exp( − mt2/2E[V ˆ m(X¯)]) gives{a mathematical formula} which completes the proof of Eq.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For any {a mathematical formula} Θ 1>0, we use Lemma 1 to obtain{a mathematical formula} From Lemma 9, it holds that{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula} Θ 1= Θ /6, {a mathematical formula} Α =5 Θ /6, and set {a mathematical formula} Δ N= Δ /2N so that the probability of failure for any N will be no more than Δ .</a>
