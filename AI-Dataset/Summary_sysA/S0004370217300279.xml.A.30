<a href="#0" id="0">The decision problem MAX – COV-SET is defined as:INSTANCE: an instance of SRG-v with a target set T and a covering set {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊂ T;QUESTION: is {a mathematical formula}T ′ maximal?</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The optimization version of k – SRG-v, say OPT – SRG-v, is{a mathematical formula}APX-hard even in the restricted case in which the graph is metric, there is only one signal s, all targets{a mathematical formula}t ∈ T(s)have the same penetration time{a mathematical formula}d(t), and there exists a maximal covering route covering all the targets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section we provide an algorithm to compute the strategies available to {a mathematical formula}D when v is the current vertex and signal s has been generated by the alarm system.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since all the vertices are possible starting points, we should face this hard problem (see Theorem 1) {a mathematical formula}|V| times, computing, for each signal, the covering routes from all the vertices.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To avoid this issue, we ask whether there exists an algorithm that in the worst case allows us to consider a number of iterations such that solving the problem for a given starting vertex v could help us finding the solution for another starting vertex {a mathematical formula}v ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">penetration times are set to {a mathematical formula}|T| − 1;</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">apply algorithm A on the following instance: graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E), target set {a mathematical formula}{T ˆ ∪ {tk},d ˆ } (where {a mathematical formula}d ˆ is d restricted to {a mathematical formula}T ˆ ∪ {tk}), start vertex v, and covering set {a mathematical formula}T ˆ ;</a>
