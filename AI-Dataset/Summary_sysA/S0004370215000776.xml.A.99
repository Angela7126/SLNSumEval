<a href="#0" id="0">These results can also be formulated in terms of partial evaluations of acceptance formulas: We have {a mathematical formula}s ∈ G Ξ ′ (X,Y) iff the partial evaluation {a mathematical formula} Φ s(X,Y) is a formula without variables that evaluates to t. Similarly, we have {a mathematical formula}s ∈ G Ξ ″ (X,Y)=U Ξ ″ (X,Y) iff the partial evaluation {a mathematical formula} Φ s(X,Y) is satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Under standard complexity assumptions, computing a new lower bound with the ultimate operator is harder than with the approximate operator.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is because, intuitively, {a mathematical formula}s ∈ U Ξ ′ (X,Y) iff the partial evaluation {a mathematical formula} Φ s(X,Y) is a tautology.</a>
