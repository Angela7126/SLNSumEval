<a href="#1" id="1">Global Inverse ConsistencyA value {a mathematical formula}(x,a) of a CN N is globally inverse consistent (GIC) iff {a mathematical formula} ∃ I ∈ sols(N)|I[x]=a.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A CN N is GIC iff every value in {a mathematical formula}values(N) is GIC.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The GIC closure of a CN N is the CN obtained from N by removing all the values that do not belong to a solution of N.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Problem 4</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Restoring GICGiven a CN N and its GIC closure {a mathematical formula}NGIC, given a constraint {a mathematical formula}c ∈ cons(N), recompute the GIC closure of N after the retraction of c from {a mathematical formula}cons(N).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this section, we address the issue of restoring GIC after the user decides to discard arbitrarily a decision that has been taken during a configuration process based on GIC.</a>
