<a href="#1" id="1">Let{a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 be compact and let K be a belief set and A be finitely representable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}K − Ais an AGM-relevance contraction operator iff there is a selection function Γ such that{a mathematical formula}K − A= ⋂ Γ (K ⊥ A).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Despite this fact, we can show several interesting results regarding the connection between the three notions (recovery, relevance, partial meet) in Boolean logics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Theorem 4.18</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider a Boolean logic{a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 such that for all{a mathematical formula}K,A ⊆ Lwhere A is finitely representable, it holds that{a mathematical formula}Cn(A)=Cn( ∅ )or{a mathematical formula}K ⊥ A ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, any partial-meet contraction operator is an AGM-compliant contraction operator.</a>

<a href="#8" id="8">A logic {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 satisfies the generalized upper-bound property iff for every {a mathematical formula}K ⊆ L, every {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ K and every finitely representable {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ L for which {a mathematical formula}A ⊈ Cn(X), there is an {a mathematical formula}X ′ such that {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ X ′ and {a mathematical formula}X ′ ∈ K ⊥ A.</a>

<a href="#11" id="11">Then, any partial-meet contraction operator is an AGM-compliant contraction operator.Obvious, by Lemma A.15 and the definitions.</a>
