<a href="#0" id="0">Consider a direct application of PDBs to Sokoban.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A natural abstraction is to keep only {a mathematical formula}k ′ of all k stones.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is admissible, since the cost of solving a subset of stones never exceeds the cost of solving the whole instance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We can construct a PDB which stores the shortest distance to the nearest abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since in Sokoban the goal state is defined implicitly, every placement of the {a mathematical formula}k ′ stones on the k goal squares is an abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">2 shows the abstract goal states for a toy instance with {a mathematical formula}k=4 and {a mathematical formula}k ′ =2.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We call this PDB the multiple goal state PDB (MPDB).</a>
