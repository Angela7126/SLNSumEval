<a href="#1" id="1">7d shows the performance of a {a mathematical formula}ToM4 agent playing ERPS against a {a mathematical formula}ToM3 opponent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Like the {a mathematical formula}ToM3 agent, the peak performance of the {a mathematical formula}ToM4 agent when playing against an opponent with learning speed {a mathematical formula} Λ j=0 shown in the figure indicates that the {a mathematical formula}ToM4 agent has no difficulty distinguishing agents that have learning speed zero from agents of a lower order of theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, the ability to make use of fourth-order theory of mind does not present an agent with advantages in ERPS beyond those of third-order theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The relation between the performance of a theory of mind agent and the predictability of his opponent ʼ s behaviour is also reflected in the results of the rock – paper – scissors – lizard – Spock game.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As predicted in hypothesis {a mathematical formula}HRPSLS, higher-order theory of mind agents perform more poorly in this game than in RPS and ERPS.</a>
