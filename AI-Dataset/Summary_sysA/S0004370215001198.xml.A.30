<a href="#0" id="0">An embedded coalition is a pair, {a mathematical formula}(C,CS), where C is a coalition, and CS is a coalition structure over A that contains C. That is, {a mathematical formula}CS ∈ Π A:C ∈ CS.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The set of all embedded coalitions will be denoted by EC.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The first dynamic programming algorithm for the coalition structure generation problem, called DP, was proposed by Yeh [93].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The DP algorithm depends directly on the following theorem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given a set of n agents, the dynamic programming algorithm, DP, computes an optimal coalition structure in{a mathematical formula}O(3n)time.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">There exists an optimal coalition structure{a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ such that{a mathematical formula} ∀ Ci ∈ CS ⁎ ,(Ci,v(Ci)) ∈ SCG.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Every coalition structure in {a mathematical formula}TCS is the result of merging some (if not all) of the coalitions in CS that are connected via solid edges.</a>
