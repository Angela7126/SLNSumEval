<a href="#0" id="0">It is defined by:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Cab is the value of the correlation between properties a and b on concept C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We think of the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n as the binary conjunction space, and of {a mathematical formula}x → Α as the prototype of the conjunctive concept Α .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We argue that if P does not specify all dimensions of {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n, then the weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → must be such that only those dimensions contributing to the concept are weighted.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then {a mathematical formula} Λ → =(0.4,0.3,0).</a>
