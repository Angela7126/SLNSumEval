<a href="#0" id="0">Their approach corresponds to using {a mathematical formula} ℓ -best-OWA-Winner, for some constant ℓ (however their model is a bit different because they derive utilities from distances between the agents, whereas in our case the utilities can be arbitrary).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let I be an instance of the Densest-K-Subgraph problem with graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) and positive integer K. From I we construct an instance {a mathematical formula}I ′ of Α -OWA-Winner, where the set of agents N is E, the set of items is {a mathematical formula}A=V ∪ {d1, … ,d ℓ − 2} (or V if {a mathematical formula} ℓ =2), and we seek a winner set of size {a mathematical formula}K+ ℓ − 2.</a>
