<a href="#1" id="1">Since the optimal sequence is infinite and the expected cost from each round onwards is stationary, the expected cost of using P can be expressed with the following equation:{a mathematical formula} Here, the first term is the fixed cost per round, the second term is the expected cost of obtaining any values, and the last term is the expected cost of continuing the search if necessary.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consequently:{a mathematical formula} The value {a mathematical formula}P=P ⁎ that minimizes {a mathematical formula}V(P) in (11) is the optimal reservation probability.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast to Proposition 1, Proposition 2 states that the optimal strategy when there is no cost for initiating a new search round ({a mathematical formula} Α =0) is to increment the reservation value by the smallest amount possible, such that the expected number of values obtained is minimized.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Here, the single reservation probability property is preserved to the extent of any number of agents already found, and all the remaining advantages of the method (e.g., distribution-independence) hold.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As evident in Section 6, increasing threshold search can also be useful in economic search settings where the searcher is not constrained to finding the best-valued agent.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This result is interesting, since increasing threshold search is by definition constrained by the need to find the best-valued agent.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In economic search settings, increasing threshold search can either be used as an alternative to traditional economic search methods (e.g., sequential search), possibly resulting in lower expected overall cost, or to directly augment those methods, making use of the threshold publication aspect as part of or alongside the regular search routine.</a>
