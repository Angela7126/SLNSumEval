<a href="#1" id="1">A function Φ over {a mathematical formula}K is called {a mathematical formula}( Α , Β , Λ )-smooth if for any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ K,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our main result in this section is the following, which shows that if each player (or agent of a player) uses such an update algorithm, the system quickly converges, in the sense that the value of the potential function {a mathematical formula} Φ (xt) quickly approaches the minimum {a mathematical formula} Φ (q), where {a mathematical formula}q=arg ⁡ minz ∈ K ⁡ Φ (z).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Implications of {a mathematical formula} Φ (xt) being close to {a mathematical formula} Φ (q) include {a mathematical formula}xt being an approximate equilibrium, which will be proved in Section 3.2.4, and achieving social efficiency, which will be given in Section 3.3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Theorem 6</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Any{a mathematical formula}x ∈ Ksuch that{a mathematical formula} Φ (x) ≤ Φ (q)+ Ε for any Ε must be a Δ -equilibrium for some{a mathematical formula} Δ ≤ 8bm Ε .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We consider the same function for the convergence purpose:{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}x ∈ K, where{a mathematical formula} with {a mathematical formula} ℓ ( ⋅ ) being the same function defined in (3).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">According to Proposition 1, Φ is a convex function.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We still assume that the cost functions satisfy the property in (4).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Now let us choose {a mathematical formula} Θ = Η Γ n Ε , and note that {a mathematical formula} Θ ≤ 1 by the assumption on Η .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">With this choice of Θ , we obtain{a mathematical formula} where{a mathematical formula} This implies that {a mathematical formula} Φ (x Τ +1) ≤ Φ (x Τ ) − Δ whenever {a mathematical formula} Φ (x Τ ) − Φ (q) ≥ 2 Δ / Θ , which completes the proof of Lemma 20.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Consider any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ K.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">First, to bound {a mathematical formula} Φ (x), recall that {a mathematical formula}ce(y) ≤ by for any y, so that we have{a mathematical formula} Since each player has a flow of amount {a mathematical formula}1n, we know that {a mathematical formula} ℓ e(x) ≤ 1 and hence{a mathematical formula} which implies that {a mathematical formula} Φ (x) ≤ bm2.</a>
