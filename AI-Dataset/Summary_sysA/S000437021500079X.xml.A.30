<a href="#1" id="1">compute a portfolio configuration of candidate solvers (which can be just a single solver) for each input problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This portfolio configuration is computed using a set of features extracted from the problem to be solved.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">gop, unlike these approaches, uses the same portfolio for all problems to be solved, which is generated for a given training data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table A.7 shows the candidate planners considered to compute the OSS portfolio for the sequential optimization track of the IPC 2011 in Section 6.1.1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The set of candidate planners used in Section 6.1.3 to assess the performance of the portfolios computed with gop in optimal planning is shown in Table A.8.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The OSS portfolio for the sequential satisficing track of the IPC 2011 has been configured in Section 6.2.1 with the set of candidate planners shown in Table A.9.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The assessment of gop to configure sequential portfolios in satisficing planning has been described in Section 6.2.3.</a>
