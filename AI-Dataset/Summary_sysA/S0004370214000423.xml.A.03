<a href="#5" id="5">Consequently, {a mathematical formula}AI is an independent set in {a mathematical formula}GCI.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">For instance, if we consider the independent set {a mathematical formula}{x1,x2,x3} (Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This way, it is possible to filter the domain of the variable {a mathematical formula}xa of the independent set as well.</a>
