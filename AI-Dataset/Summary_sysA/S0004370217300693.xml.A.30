<a href="#1" id="1">In this section, we compare Eva [43] and OLL [41] MaxSAT algorithms, that inspired the best performing solvers on industrial instances at MSE-2014, {a mathematical formula}eva500a and {a mathematical formula}mscg[42] respectively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The key point is how to transform {a mathematical formula} Φ k into {a mathematical formula} Φ k+1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">After analyzing both algorithms, we have observed that the underlying idea comes from the following observation: a MaxSAT formula {a mathematical formula} Φ n with n soft clauses and {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ n) ≥ e, {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ e ≤ n is MaxSAT reducible (Definition 5) to a formula {a mathematical formula} Φ n ′ + 〈 □ ,e 〉 with {a mathematical formula}n − e soft clauses and e empty clauses:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Where {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ n ′ )=cost( Φ n) − cost( 〈 □ ,e 〉 ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Section 4, we present the WPM3 algorithm, that identifies {a mathematical formula} Φ n with e greater than 1 and solve them to optimality.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In our algorithm the set A in an at-most constraint {a mathematical formula} 〈 A,k,w 〉 is ordered.</a>
