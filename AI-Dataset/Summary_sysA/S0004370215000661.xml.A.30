<a href="#0" id="0">In logic-based planning, the planner receives the description of the initial state, {a mathematical formula}sini, and a goal description, g, which comprises a set of grounded predicates that should be observed after plan execution [11].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using these elements, the planner searches for sequences of actions that would permit changes in {a mathematical formula}sini that are necessary to reach the goal g. This search is performed using a set of POs, {a mathematical formula}R, each of which codes the expected changes after executing an action.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A PO is represented as{a mathematical formula} where p is the precondition,{sup:1}a is the action, e is the effect, and P is a probability estimate, which indicates how likely the effect e will be obtained every time that p is observed in a state and action a is executed,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To reduce the time invested in learning, the system only generates POs when a plan cannot be generated due to missing POs or when the execution of a PO has an unexpected effect.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">5(b)) started appearing after some POs were generated from instructions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is expected because at the very beginning of the learning, the PO set is almost empty and some POs need to be generated before the planner can use them for planning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These new POs, which could have unexpected results, caused an increase in the unexpected effects.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The POs executed during each step of the plan were{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} In particular, the last PO (36), which moved the target cup two positions to the right, included the descriptor {a mathematical formula}em(0, âˆ’ 1) in its precondition, which did not change with the action.</a>
