<a href="#1" id="1">This leads to the definition of generalized aspects[4] as maximal sets of nonsingular configurations {a mathematical formula}(x,q) that can all be connected within Σ without crossing any singularity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">More formally, the set of nonsingular configurations of the robot is{a mathematical formula} This corresponds, e.g., to the four quarters of circle in the left hand side graphic of Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The proposed method for the generalized aspect computation relies on solving the following NCSP whose solutions are the nonsingular configurations of the robot:{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula} Σ ([x],[q]) be the solution set of this NCSP.</a>
