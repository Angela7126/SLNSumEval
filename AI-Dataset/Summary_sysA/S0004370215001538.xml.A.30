<a href="#0" id="0">With the exception of big switch approaches, like the one of Sanghi and Dowe [15], current systems are based on algorithmic approaches specifically designed to solve a special class of such problems and even only one specific test.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is an open question whether a general algorithmic approach for a diverse set of intelligence tests can be designed in principle.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Comparing the current situation of computer models which solve intelligence tests with the history of game playing, it took about 55 years before the rise of general game playing.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In other words, these cognitive approaches are not meant to build systems that are able to perform well (or perfectly) in some tasks (or even in intelligence test problems), but rather that perform in the same way humans do, solving problems that humans usually solve but also failing at problems where humans fail.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As a result, the analysis of this work has to be done in terms of the specialisation of the techniques that were used, their performance and the range of problems, hence raising important doubts about the use of intelligence tests for evaluating AI systems.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A crucial difference that makes systems distinctive is not only the kind of problems they solve, but also the great deal of techniques that have been used for solving the same or different intelligence tests.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Nonetheless this can also be seen as an opportunity of computer models, AI, and other approaches based on information theory, to help improving intelligence tests.</a>
