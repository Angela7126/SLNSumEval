<a href="#0" id="0">Let us examine the different methods of UB propagation between agents, according to their number of children.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When an agent has exactly one child, its upper bound UB is the same as that of its child's UB, which means that all agents within a chain in the pseudo tree share the same UB.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As defined above, the {a mathematical formula}Latest_Divider(Ai) is the latest ancestor of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai that has more than a single child, the {a mathematical formula}Latest_Divider(Ai) is the closest ancestor of {a mathematical formula}Ai, who divided the problem into sub-problems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, when agent {a mathematical formula}Ab (Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">1) assigns a value to a CPA, it is unaware of the constrain cost between its assignment and {a mathematical formula}Aa's assignment, from agent {a mathematical formula}Aa perspective.</a>
