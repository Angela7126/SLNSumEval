<a href="#1" id="1">Inspired by two observations: 1) the conflict between proximity and diversity requirements is aggravated with the increase of the number of objectives and 2) the Pareto dominance loses its effectiveness for a high-dimensional space but works well on a low-dimensional space, BiGE converts a given many-objective optimization problem into a bi-goal (objective) optimization problem regarding individuals' proximity and crowding degree, and then handles it using Pareto dominance in this bi-goal domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">BiGE treats an MOP with many objectives as a bi-goal optimization problem regarding minimizing the proximity of individuals towards the optimal direction and minimizing the crowding degree of individuals in the population.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Conversion from an MOP with a number of objectives to a bi-goal problem involves an integration of the objectives.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to make the integration feasible (i.e., to be able to deal with an MOP with non-commensurable objective functions), in BiGE each objective of individuals is normalized (with respect to its minimum and maximum values in the current population) before estimating their proximity and crowding degree.</a>
