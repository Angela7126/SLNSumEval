<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, the vector representation obtained by averaging the vectors of the words Vietnam and capital is very close to the vector representation of the word Hanoi in the semantic space of word embeddings.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our system obtained state-of-the-art results on multilingual All-Words Word Sense Disambiguation using Wikipedia as sense inventory, evaluated on the SemEval-2013 dataset [95], and on English All-Words Word Sense Disambiguation using WordNet as sense inventory, evaluated on the SemEval-2007 [111] and SemEval-2013 [95] datasets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This combination is based on the average similarity scores given by lexical and unified vectors for each sense pair.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, we evaluated our embedded representations on the word to sense semantic similarity task.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As explained above, our system is based on Semantic Similarity (see Section 6) for the sense clustering tasks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Lexical vectors were also computed for each Wikipedia page and the similarity between a Wikipedia page and each domain was calculated.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given that Nasari provides semantic representations for both concepts and named entities, this task was analogous to Word Sense Disambiguation (see Section 9.2) with the only difference being that in this task we only considered entity synsets as candidates.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We performed the evaluations on the same datasets as those used in Section 6.1.1 for word similarity and in Section 9.3.3 for Word Sense Disambiguation with WordNet as sense inventory.</a>
