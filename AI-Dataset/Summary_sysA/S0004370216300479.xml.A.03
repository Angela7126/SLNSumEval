<a href="#0" id="0">We say that an action theory {a mathematical formula}D is bounded by b if every executable situation is bounded by b, formally:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}D be a basic action theory.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We say that a basic action theory is effect bounded if every fluent {a mathematical formula}F ∈ F is effect bounded.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Observe that Z is not further substituted in {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We now show that verifying {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp properties against bounded action theories is decidable.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By induction hypothesis, such a {a mathematical formula} Φ A ′ exists.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In other words {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ is a domain-independent formula [1].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Now observe that, since the action theory is bounded, so is the extension of each fluent F at {a mathematical formula}q1 and {a mathematical formula}q1 ′ .</a>
