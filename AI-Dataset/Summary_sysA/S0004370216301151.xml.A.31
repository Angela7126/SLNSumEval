<a href="#0" id="0">If the resulting sequence of predicates is the same as the sequence of predicates in at least one meaning obtained from a correct denoting utterance, the learner's utterance is classified as having an error in form.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this case, the learner is judged to have chosen a correct meaning but an incorrect form to express that meaning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The goal of the teacher is to choose a possible correction with the same meaning as that intended by the learner.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A possible correction is chosen by the teacher by considering the set of denoting utterances whose meanings have the same sequence of predicates and choosing one such utterance using a measure of similarity to the learner's utterance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, if {a mathematical formula}(el1,sm1) corresponds to a denoting utterance for the situation, the teacher may choose la elipse pequena as a possible correction for el elipse pequeno.</a>
