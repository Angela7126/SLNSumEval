<a href="#0" id="0">The bi-goal evolution is implemented with two specific methods of estimating individuals' performance (i.e., proximity and crowding degree), and also with simple individual comparison strategies in the mating and environmental selection.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to make the integration feasible (i.e., to be able to deal with an MOP with non-commensurable objective functions), in BiGE each objective of individuals is normalized (with respect to its minimum and maximum values in the current population) before estimating their proximity and crowding degree.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the two combinatorial optimization problems, since the range of their Pareto front is unknown, we set the reference point slightly worse than the boundary values of the nondominated set with respect to the mixed population consisting of all the obtained solutions; that is, the points with 13,000 and 22 for each objective (i.e., {a mathematical formula}r=13,000m and {a mathematical formula}r=22m) are fixed for the knapsack and TSP problems, respectively.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Although all considered solution sets appear to converge into the optimal front (the upper and lower bounds of objective i in WFG's Pareto front are 0 and {a mathematical formula}2Ã—i, respectively), the six algorithms perform differently in terms of diversity maintenance.</a>
