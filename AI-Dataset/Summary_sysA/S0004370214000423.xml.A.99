<a href="#0" id="0">Overall, the greedy propagator of AtMostNValue takes a graph G as input, calls a function F to compute independent sets in G and then filters variable domains with a set of rules {a mathematical formula}R. Therefore, we introduce the notation {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 G|F|R 〉 to define such a family of propagators.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In [21], we employed a two-step search strategy that first finds a subset of z allowed values and then assign a value to every decision variable {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In case no solution exists, a backtrack fixes it to 0 and turns the constraint into its opposite i.e., {a mathematical formula}maximum(X) ≠ z, so that the approach remains exact.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, the good propagation of AllDifferent constraints only makes a difference once the AMNV filtering is strong enough, i.e., when {a mathematical formula}k>0.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It shows that MIP model fails to solve about half of instances on both data sets: It is not able to provide either lower bounds or upper bounds ({a mathematical formula}100% gap).</a>
