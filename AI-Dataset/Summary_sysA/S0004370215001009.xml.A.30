<a href="#0" id="0">The definition does not exactly define a probability distribution as it contains imprecise knowledge, but we can define a probability distribution consistent with the definition for those two random variables by the following assignments:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} From this one can compute the probability of for instance {a mathematical formula}P(DM=true):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}AV is an event space representing events concerning the random variables V;</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">New here is the definition of credal set specifications for a countable number of variables in the sense of Section 5.2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We define credal sets by a number of random variable definitions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Random variable definitions define credal sets for groups of finitely many random variables, such that the definition of each random variable depends only on a finite number of other ones.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Definitions have the form:{a mathematical formula} where each {a mathematical formula}Vi is a random variable label, {a mathematical formula}Xi is a parameter, {a mathematical formula}pi is a probability and {a mathematical formula} Φ i is a constraint.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A PCLP program defines a credal set over all random variables{a mathematical formula}V1,V2, … occurring in it.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The lower and upper probability bounds of a query q, concerning only the first n random variables, in a PCLP program, fulfilling the exact inference conditions, can be computed as:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}HereCis the credal set specification defined by the program (Lemma 4).</a>
