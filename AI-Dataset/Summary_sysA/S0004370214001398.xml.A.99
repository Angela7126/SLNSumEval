<a href="#0" id="0">To gain sufficient time for initializing and executing a hitting movement, the robot needs to be anticipatory about its human opponent's intention, which human players rely heavily on [2].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The prediction of the human partner's intention can be realized by modeling how the intention directs the dynamics of hitting movement [53].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the table tennis scenario, this Intention-Driven Dynamics Model (IDDM) leads to an online algorithm that, given a time series of observations, continually predicts the human player's intended target, i.e., where the human intends to shoot the ball [53], as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example in the case of human â€“ robot table tennis, the robot's hitting point can usually be precisely predicted 120 ms after the human player hits the ball [53], and, thus, an optimal policy would stop waiting and initiate a hitting movement.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In practice, we enforce that the robot takes a stopping action when the robot's hitting point can be reliably predicted by the vision system.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">7 shows that it is important for the robot to be anticipatory and to choose optimal action even before the human's intention can be accurately predicted.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Movement initiation requires an early decision on the type of action, such as a forehand or backhand movement, before the opponent has hit the ball.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Experimental results using real data and a simulated environment showed that the anticipatory action selection can be used for a robot table tennis player to enhance its performance against human players, where the robot decided the timing to initiate a selected hitting movement according to the prediction of the human opponent.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We concluded that anticipatory action selection substantially improves the robot's performance, and that uncertainties in prediction needs to be taken into account for optimal stopping.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">POMDPs had been shown to be suitable to formulate the anticipatory action selection problem by taking into account the uncertainties in prediction.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We also showed that existing algorithms for POMDPs, such as LSPI and MCP, can be applied to substantially improve the robot's performance in its interaction with humans.</a>
