<a href="#0" id="0">If this polynomial-time analysis does not solve the problem, an {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ algorithm is used to identify an optimal protein design.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To evaluate the efficiency of the CFN approach, we model the CPD problem using several combinatorial optimization formalisms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We compare the performance of the 0/1 linear programming and 0/1 quadratic programming solver cplex, the semidefinite programming based Boolean quadratic optimization tool biqmac, several weighted partial MaxSAT solvers, the Markov random field optimization solvers daoopt and mplp[80], and the CFN solver toulbar2, against that of a well-established CPD approach implementing {a mathematical formula}DEE/A ⁎ , on various realistic protein design problems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When the DEE algorithm does not significantly reduce the search space, the {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search tree can be too slow or memory demanding and the problem cannot be solved.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We assume, without loss of generality, that every CFN includes at least one unary cost function {a mathematical formula}wi per variable {a mathematical formula}i ∈ X and a nullary cost function {a mathematical formula}w ∅ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Several solvers were unable to solve any of the instances in the 9000 s allocated globally per problem for each approach (including any pre-processing used in the method such as DEE in the {a mathematical formula}DEE/A ⁎ approach).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Despite the compact associated models, neither cplex for the quadratic programming model, nor biqmac for the quadratic Boolean optimization model could solve any single instance in less than 9000 s. Similarly, most of the WPMS solvers failed to solve any instance, in either of the two encoding tested.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The simplest formal optimization problem underlying CPD looks for a Global Minimum Energy Conformation (GMEC) over a rigid backbone and altered side-chains (identity and conformation).</a>
