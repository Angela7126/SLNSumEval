<a href="#0" id="0">However, the level of detail and the many types of information required for successfully accomplishing robot tasks, such as exact times, 3D geometric information, kinematic structures and appearance models, are difficult to encode in purely symbolic form.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our knowledge base only has a rather shallow symbolic representation of general concepts, while most information about the robot, its environment and perceptions is merely a “ virtual knowledge base ” computed at runtime from the data structures of the robot's control program.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There is a wide range of aspects that contribute to the performance of a robot knowledge processing system, including the number of facts it contains, the coverage of relevant knowledge areas, the range of inference methods that are supported, the run time for common queries, the scalability regarding the amount of information stored, the usefulness of the computed results for robot tasks, etc.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In our case, however, the reified objects are more than just a changing value because they provide a memory of past states, they describe the source of this relation by their type, and allow to reason about multiple “ possible worlds ” , for example the perceived, desired and simulated world.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To quantify the performance in a common task, we have simulated the creation of a large number of object perceptions as described in Section 4.3, which are among the most complex structures in KnowRob.</a>
