<a href="#0" id="0">Let Π be a {a mathematical formula} Σ i-feasible coalition structure, and note that {a mathematical formula}val Σ i(v, Π )=val Σ i(v,Ci), where {a mathematical formula}Ci is the coalition in Π such that {a mathematical formula}ai ∈ Ci.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In its turn, {a mathematical formula}val Σ i(v,Ci) coincides with {a mathematical formula}val Σ (v,Ci), by construction of {a mathematical formula} Σ i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, check that {a mathematical formula}Ci is trivially a Σ -feasible coalition.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">On the other hand, if {a mathematical formula}Ci is a Σ -feasible coalition, then we can build a {a mathematical formula} Σ i-feasible coalition structure Π consisting of {a mathematical formula}Ci and all other agents as singleton coalitions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Again, we have that {a mathematical formula}val Σ i(v, Π )=val Σ (v,Ci).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, the value of any {a mathematical formula} Σ i-optimal coalition structure coincides with the maximum possible value of any Σ -feasible coalition including agent {a mathematical formula}ai.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the following, we shall denote this optimal value by {a mathematical formula}vci ⁎ , and we explicitly remark here that, because of Theorem 4.12 and the above characterization, {a mathematical formula}vci ⁎ can be computed in polynomial time.For each agent {a mathematical formula}aj ∈ N ∖ S, let {a mathematical formula} Σ j= 〈 G,S ∪ {aj}, Α j, Β j,0,0 〉 be the valuation structure such that {a mathematical formula} Α j(ai)= Β j(ai)=0, for each {a mathematical formula}ai ∈ S, and {a mathematical formula} Α j(aj)=x and {a mathematical formula} Β j(aj)=y.</a>
