<a href="#0" id="0">In general it can often be observed that solvers perform either very good or very bad on a specific family.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In addition to the application of preprocessing prior to solving, the actual selection of benchmarks might have an influence on the performance of solvers and hence on the rankings in terms of solved instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A ranking of solvers obtained by experiments might be skewed if certain families of instances are overrepresented in the benchmark set that underlies the experimental evaluation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast to the experiments conducted in the case of the best-foot-forward experiments above, in the following we are interested in the effects of applying different combinations of preprocessors in multiple rounds and assess the solving performance of preprocessors.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As illustrated by Table 15, the numbers of instances solved by preprocessing using a particular execution sequence is sensitive to the ordering of the preprocessing tools in the sequence.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the lower part of Table 18, the workflow implemented in QuBE-cert and ResQu is also based on Q-resolution proofs and certificates in terms of Skolem and Herbrand functions and thus is most closely related to DepQBF combined with QBFcert and ResQu.</a>
