<a href="#0" id="0">The theorem essentially says that, given a context structure {a mathematical formula}D and a clause system {a mathematical formula}S saturated under the {a mathematical formula}Hyper, {a mathematical formula}Pred, and {a mathematical formula}Succ rules, we can read off the consequences of the form {a mathematical formula}K ⊑ M from the sets {a mathematical formula}S(v) provided that {a mathematical formula}K ⊑ M is a query, the context v is complete (cf.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To ensure that each clause obtained by applying our consequence-based algorithm to {a mathematical formula}D is a logical consequence of {a mathematical formula}O, we require {a mathematical formula}D to be sound: in addition to the condition on {a mathematical formula} ∃ R.A-edges from Definition 8, the known literals in each context of {a mathematical formula}D must logically follow from the context's core — that is, {a mathematical formula}O ⊨ core(v) ⊑ L should hold for each context v in {a mathematical formula}D and each literal {a mathematical formula}L ∈ knw(v).</a>
