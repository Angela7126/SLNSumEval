<a href="#0" id="0">In order to study the effectiveness of our proposed approach for algorithm design, we configured SATenstein-LS on training sets from various distributions of SAT instances and compared the performance of the SATenstein-LS solvers thus obtained against that of several existing high-performance SAT solvers on disjoint test sets.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, although the design space of SATenstein-LS consists solely of SLS solvers, we have also compared its performance to that of high-performance complete solvers (listed in Table 6).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Table 9 compares the performance of SATenstein-LS solvers and four prominent complete SAT solvers (two for each distribution).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the other two industrial distributions (FAC and CBMC(SE)), the performance of the selected complete solvers was much better than that of either the SATenstein-LS solvers and any of our other local search solvers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To better understand the automatically-constructed SATenstein-LS solvers, we compared their automatically selected design choices to the design of the existing SLS solvers for SAT (the full active parameter configurations of the six SATenstein-LS solvers can be found in Table 16).</a>
