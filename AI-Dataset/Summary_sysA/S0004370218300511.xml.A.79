<a href="#0" id="0">Abstraction heuristic [12]Let Α be an abstraction with an associated abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">All the rest of SM&S abstractions in the hierarchy, {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i,0<i ≤ n, enable the desired trade-off between {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S 0 and {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S n. Each {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i is strictly more relaxed than the previous {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i − 1, so that the size of the abstract state spaces decreases at the expense of producing less informed heuristics {a mathematical formula}h Α SM&S i − 1(s) ≥ h Α SM&S i(s).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Opposite examples can be defined where the number of BDD nodes required to represent {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i(S) is exponentially larger than the number of nodes to describe S. However, the correspondence between the ADD that describes the M&S abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α 2 and the upper levels of any BDD describing a set of abstract states lets us prove some bounds on the size of BDDs describing any set of abstract states.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note, however, that even though {a mathematical formula}¬P ignores the perimeter for the initialization of abstract searches, it uses the perimeter for other purposes such as selecting one abstraction from the hierarchy (the one in which the perimeter is reduced enough) and to return the maximum between the heuristics derived from all the searches (including the perimeter and one or more abstract searches).</a>
