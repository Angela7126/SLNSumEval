<a href="#0" id="0">As well-known, {a mathematical formula}SROIQ-RL knowledge bases can be expressed in first-order (FO) logic [26], where every axiom {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ L Σ is translated into an equivalent FO sentence {a mathematical formula} ∀ x. Φ Α (x) where x contains all free variables of {a mathematical formula} Φ Α depending on the type of the axiom (see below).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Furthermore, he presented – exploiting a normal form of axioms – a fixed datalog program that gives a universal encoding of the proof systems associated with concrete DL knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K, where {a mathematical formula}K and the instance query are represented by a set of facts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In turn, the positive literals in {a mathematical formula}Sc, 〈 Α ,e 〉 must be derived via the materialization calculus, and the negative literals via contradiction proofs defined by the test mechanism mentioned at the beginning of Section 5.2 and previously detailed.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the translation of local programs, we also add the defeasibility deduction rules of {a mathematical formula}PD, defining the rules for overriding and defeasible propagation of the global knowledge: in particular, the following rule ovr-subc provides the condition for overriding of atomic inclusion axioms like the one considered in our example:{a mathematical formula} Propagation of defeasible atomic inclusion axioms is defined by the rule prop-subc:{a mathematical formula} In Step 3 of the translation, the final program {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD) results as the union of {a mathematical formula}PG(G) and all the local programs, including {a mathematical formula}PC(cultural_tourist,KtourD).Let us now consider what can be inferred from {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Similarly for {a mathematical formula}a ∈ NI Γ ‾ and the global interpretation {a mathematical formula}M ‾ .If {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ,e 〉 ∈ Χ (x): if Α is in normal form, then {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ,e 〉 ∈ Χ ′ (x); otherwise, let {a mathematical formula} Α ′ be the (single) defeasible axiom in the set obtained by exhaustively applying the rules in Table 2 to Α , then {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ′ ,e 〉 ∈ Χ ′ (x).For the first direction (i), we show that for all axioms</a>
