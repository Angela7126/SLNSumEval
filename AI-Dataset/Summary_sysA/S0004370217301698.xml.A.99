<a href="#0" id="0">In fact, we will see that RCC-5 can be represented in two different ways (which we denote RCC-{a mathematical formula}5set and RCC-{a mathematical formula}5 Ω − cat) that give rise to exactly the same computational problem (by Proposition 13).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, we will also see (in Sections 5 and 6.2) that there exists an RCC-5 constraint language {a mathematical formula}R such that RCC-{a mathematical formula}5set(R ∪ {{c}}) is NP-complete while RCC-{a mathematical formula}5 Ω − cat(R ∪ X) is polynomial-time solvable, where {a mathematical formula}{c} is a particular constant relation and X is an arbitrary finite set of constants.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, adding constant relations to constraint languages that are computationally equivalent (but represented differently) may lead to problems with different computational complexity.</a>
