<a href="#3" id="3">In this part of the trajectory, the cubic trajectory shows a load swing of {a mathematical formula}5 – 12 ∘ , while the learned trajectory controls the swing to under {a mathematical formula}4 ∘ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Path-following with reduced load displacement evaluation compares the load displacement and path-following errors of Algorithm 1 with two other methods: a minimal residual oscillations method described in Section 3.2, and path-following with no load displacement reduction.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The path-following only method creates minimum time path-following trajectories, by choosing actions that transition the system as close as possible to the reference path in the direction of the goal state with no consideration to the load swing.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We use three reference trajectories: a straight line, a two-line segment, and a helix.</a>

<a href="#8" id="8">Path-following error for Algorithm 1 remains close to the path-following only trajectory.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For both trajectories, the accumulated path-following error is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than for the minimal residual oscillations method.</a>
