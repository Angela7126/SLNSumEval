<a href="#0" id="0">Having defined the truth value of a constraint atom {a mathematical formula}C(X) in an interpretation I, an immediate consequence operator can be defined in the standard way:{a mathematical formula} Grounded models of this operator still represent the same intuitions: an interpretation I is grounded if it admits no unfounded sets, or said differently, if it contains no atoms without external support.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, I is grounded if it contains no non-empty set U of atoms such that {a mathematical formula}body(r)I[U:f] for each rule r with {a mathematical formula}head(r) ∈ U.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For arbitrary formula Φ in {a mathematical formula}LK, Q a possible world structure and I an interpretation, we define that Φ is satisfied with respect to Q and I (denoted {a mathematical formula}Q,I ⊨ Φ ) by the standard recursive rules of propositional satisfaction, augmented with one additional rule:{a mathematical formula} For objective formulas Φ , it holds that {a mathematical formula}Q,I ⊨ Φ if and only if {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Viewed from this perspective, {a mathematical formula}T is the singleton set consisting of one inference rule:{a mathematical formula} Surely, such an inference rule should be of no value, as it can only derive something that has been derived before!</a>
