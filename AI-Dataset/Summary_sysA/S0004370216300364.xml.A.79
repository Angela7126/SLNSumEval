<a href="#0" id="0">Regression analysis models assume that the bidding strategy of the opponent could be defined by a formula with unknown parameters; that is, the problem of estimating the bidding strategy of the opponent could be easily reduced to the regression analysis on the utility values of the received offers from the opponent in the agent's own utility space.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, according to the underlying scheme in which they are applied to extract the opponent's preferences, the existing state of the art opponent models (which use a common negotiation setting for estimating the preference order of the negotiation outcomes and are designed and implemented in the Genius framework [36], [37] in the ANAC tournaments) could be categorized into the following [38]:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the setting adopted in Experiment I (Section 5.1.1), the accuracy of this proposed model is evaluated together with other opponent models through a Pearson Correlation between the estimated and real bid utilities [38]:{a mathematical formula} where, {a mathematical formula}uOP is the real utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ is the estimated utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP( Ω → ) is the real utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space, and {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ ( Ω → ) is the estimated utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space.</a>
