<a href="#4" id="4">15 summarizes all the elements discussed so far to build maps of Web Regions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In particular, regions from the Web of Linked Data are obtained via formal specifications in the language {a mathematical formula}L (see the first arrow in Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">15).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A region is the portion of the Web of Linked Data that is navigated during the evaluation of a navigational expression and it is represented as a directed graph (as discussed in Section 4).</a>
