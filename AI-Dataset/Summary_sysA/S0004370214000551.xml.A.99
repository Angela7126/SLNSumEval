<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we propose two algorithms: Potential Search (PTS) and Anytime Potential Search/Anytime Non-Parametric {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ ({a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Next, we describe {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ , which is a non-parametric anytime search algorithm using the PTS evaluation function {a mathematical formula}u( ⋅ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Next, we give a different derivation of {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ , as a non-parametric improvement of the {a mathematical formula}ARA ⁎ anytime search algorithm.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this section we empirically evaluate the performance of PTS as a bounded-cost search algorithm, and {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ as an anytime search algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The benefits of {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ in this domain are very clear.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ dominates all other algorithms throughout the search.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Although not visible in the figure, we also report that {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ found an initial solution faster than {a mathematical formula}ARA ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This paper discussed two search problems: bounded-cost search, and anytime search.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In a bounded-cost search, once a solution of cost lower than a given cost is found, the search can halt.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Both PTS and its corresponding anytime algorithm {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ outperform competitive algorithms on a wide range of domains.</a>
