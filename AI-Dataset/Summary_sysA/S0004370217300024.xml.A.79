<a href="#0" id="0">A possibility result establishes that every aggregation rule belonging to a certain class of rules (typically defined in terms of certain axioms) is collectively rational with respect to all graph properties that satisfy a certain meta-property.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The first such axiom is an independence condition that requires that the decision of whether or not a given edge e should be part of the collective graph should only depend on which of the individual graphs include e. This corresponds to well-known axioms in preference and judgment aggregation [5], [17].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In social choice theory, an impossibility theorem states that it is not possible to devise an aggregation rule that satisfies certain axioms and that is also collectively rational with respect to a certain combination of properties of the structures being aggregated (which in our case are graphs).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, the aggregation rule F that returns the full graph in case all individual graphs satisfy {a mathematical formula} ◇ (p ∨ ¬p), and the empty graph otherwise, is model collectively rational but not world collectively rational.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, Example 14 can be used to show the strict implication in item (ii), since it concerns an aggregation rule that is frame collectively rational with respect to modal formula {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p but not model collectively rational with respect to the same formula.</a>
