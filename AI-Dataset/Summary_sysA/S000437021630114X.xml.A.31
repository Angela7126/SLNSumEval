<a href="#0" id="0">In symbolic search the operators are not applied over a single state but rather over sets of states.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Nevertheless, operators only need to be applied over states that satisfy the corresponding conditions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We take advantage of this by precomputing the subset of states relevant to a given TR prior to the image operation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Do our techniques improve{a mathematical formula}BDDA ⁎ ?</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Image computation methods improve {a mathematical formula}BDDA ⁎ as much as bidirectional symbolic uniform-cost search.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This reveals that the advantage of the new image computation methods is not limited to a particular algorithm.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">State-invariant constraints also help, but less than in bidirectional symbolic uniform-cost search.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The overall results again show that the use of state invariants helps to improve results of {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ as well.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, the benefits are not as stable as in the case of uniform-cost search.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Even though pruning invalid states ({a mathematical formula}MBDD100k) increases total coverage, it decreases the coverage in 9 domains with respect to the version without invalid state pruning ({a mathematical formula}M ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In order to find out whether the performance loss is caused by the abstract searches that generate the heuristic or the {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search, we analyze the quality of the heuristic used.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">One typical way to measure such quality is the heuristic value of the initial state.</a>
