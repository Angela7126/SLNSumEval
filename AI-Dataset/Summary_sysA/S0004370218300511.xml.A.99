<a href="#0" id="0">In the original state space, sets of states are represented as functions {a mathematical formula}f:S → {1,0}, in terms of binary variables {a mathematical formula}x=x1, … ,xn.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the same way, sets of abstract states in {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i= Α i ⊗ Π Υ i+1, … , Υ n are represented as characteristic functions {a mathematical formula}f:S Α SM&S i → {1,0}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An important decision is what variables (and variable ordering) should be used to represent sets of abstract states in {a mathematical formula}S Α SM&S i.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Opposite examples can be defined where the number of BDD nodes required to represent {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i(S) is exponentially larger than the number of nodes to describe S. However, the correspondence between the ADD that describes the M&S abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α 2 and the upper levels of any BDD describing a set of abstract states lets us prove some bounds on the size of BDDs describing any set of abstract states.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Proposition 4 bounds the size of a single layer of the BDD describing a set of abstract states in {a mathematical formula} Θ Α SM&S k. However, this result can easily be extended to all the upper layers in the BDD.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As we are assuming a linear merge strategy, all the M&S abstractions are built as the merge of an M&S abstraction and the atomic abstraction of another variable.</a>
