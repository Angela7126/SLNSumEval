<a href="#0" id="0">AfD obtains {a mathematical formula}S Α by selecting a subset of features from the original state space S with which it can predict the action that a human teacher has taken in a set of demonstrations H. Learning in {a mathematical formula}S Α can be significantly more efficient because a linear reduction in the number of features leads to an exponential reduction in the size of the state space.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The minimum number of samples in ADA, given a set of demonstrations H and parameter {a mathematical formula} Ε ≈ 0.1, is{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}miS,n is the mutual information vector on the original state space S, taking only a subset of n randomly chosen samples from all the samples in H. The subtraction and division are elementwise and the average function takes the average of the values of the resulting vector.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Because of the variability of mutual information, it is necessary to evaluate (4) several times for each possible n, each time with a different and independently chosen set of samples.</a>
