<a href="#0" id="0">The real advance here over previous work such as [19] is that there is no longer any need to make assumptions about what the other believes and prefers: the agent can now come to a decision using its own relative preferences between values, its own beliefs and the degree of risk it is prepared to take, whilst requiring no additional machinery: it uses only the AATS+V [19] based on its own beliefs, causal model and values [45].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Even where the action performed does affect values, as in [47], so that the intrinsic value of an action can be taken into account, what matters for the agent concerned is its own individual action, and so all transitions between the same pair of states containing that action will promote and demote the same values, as far as that agent is concerned.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, for our current purposes, we will consider all joint actions with the same action by the agent concerned leading to the same state to be equivalent, so that consideration can be limited to the different outcomes possible for a given action of the agent engaged in the reasoning, irrespective of how many joint actions reach each outcome.</a>
