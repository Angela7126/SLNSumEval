<a href="#0" id="0">Given a budget in terms of the maximum number of cross-system entity correspondences to be constructed, our goal is to 1) actively construct entity correspondences across the source and the target systems, and 2) make use of them for knowledge transfer from the source task {a mathematical formula}S to the target task {a mathematical formula}D. In the sequel, we denote by {a mathematical formula}X ⁎ ,i the ith column of the matrix X, and superscript {sup: ⊤ } the transpose of a vector or matrix, and use the words “ domain ” and “ system ” interchangeably.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the rest of this section, we first describe the idea of the extended matrix factorization method in the transfer learning manner {a mathematical formula}fTL by assuming a set of cross-system correspondences be constructed as input, and then present the high-level idea on how to design {a mathematical formula}ActiveLearn() to actively select entities for querying cross-system correspondences.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The proposed error-based active learning approach thus aims to select a set of queries {a mathematical formula}Q at each iteration to construct K more correspondences between the source and the target system in addition to the existing set of correspondences such that the resulting new CF model obtains lower generalization error than any other set of queries {a mathematical formula}Q ′ of K correspondences construction, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}C is the set of cross-system correspondences used in the current CF model, which can be empty.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From the figure, we can find that as {a mathematical formula}MTL aims to exploit cross-system entity correspondences to transfer knowledge from the source system to the target system, the computational time increases when the number of the constructed cross-system entity correspondences increases.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, when the proportion of the constructed entity correspondences is not larger than 20%, the computational time of {a mathematical formula}MTL is very close to its corresponding NoTransf method without correspondences, respectively.</a>
