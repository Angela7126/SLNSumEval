<a href="#1" id="1">Here, the evaluation of a negotiation issue value for the opponent is given by 1 minus the evaluation of that negotiation issue value for the agent (e.g., the models proposed by Jazayeriy et al.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">[14] and Zhang et al.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These models consider the hypothesis space as the preference order of the negotiation issues as well as evaluation values of each negotiation issue.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">They update the probability of each hypothesis using the Bayesian formula in a consecutive manner as each offer is received from the opponent through the negotiation session.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, the utility of the bids that agent A sends to itself (side A) and to the opponent (side B), 1) when applying POPPONENT, and 2) when applying No Model are shown Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the setting adopted in Experiment I (Section 5.1.1), the accuracy of this proposed model is evaluated together with other opponent models through a Pearson Correlation between the estimated and real bid utilities [38]:{a mathematical formula} where, {a mathematical formula}uOP is the real utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ is the estimated utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP( Ω → ) is the real utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space, and {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ ( Ω → ) is the estimated utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space.</a>
