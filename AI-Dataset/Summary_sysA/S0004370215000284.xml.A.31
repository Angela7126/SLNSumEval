<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}ar is the action that the rule represents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula} Φ r( Χ ) are the preconditions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When the action {a mathematical formula}ar is executed, only the rule r with preconditions present in the state will be applicable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} Ω r,i are the effects, which have an associated probability of {a mathematical formula}pr,i ∈ [0,1].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The sum of probabilities is always {a mathematical formula} ∑ ipr,i=1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Effects define the set of predicates that are changed in the state when the rule is applied.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An action has a set of parameters {a mathematical formula} Χ a, which represent the objects with which the action interacts.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula} Γ Φ is used to create the set of candidates that can be valid rule alternatives.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Each candidate is generated by making a copy of the current rules {a mathematical formula} Γ new and modifying one of the rules {a mathematical formula}r Φ ∈ Γ new, which is also in {a mathematical formula} Γ Φ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The preconditions {a mathematical formula}r Φ are changed by replacing a predicate that is changed by the excuse Φ with a predicate that is present in the current state {a mathematical formula}p ∈ s.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The aim is to check whether the predicates changed by the excuse are actually in the preconditions, or if any other predicates in the current state should be used instead.</a>
