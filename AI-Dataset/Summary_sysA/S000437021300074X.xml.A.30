<a href="#0" id="0">This is achieved by first defining directly on TET-feature values a discriminant function that turns a TET-feature into a predictive model (Section 3).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Based on this discriminant function a TET structure learning algorithm is developed that, strictly speaking, will discover a feature {a mathematical formula}(T,f) (T a TET, f a discriminant function defined on T), but from which in a trivial abstraction step we can extract the model-independent TET feature T (Section 5).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the preceding example we have already introduced the values of the TET feature (1) for the entities {a mathematical formula}a1, â€¦ ,a5 in Fig.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">These values refine the informal count-of-counts shown in Fig.</a>
