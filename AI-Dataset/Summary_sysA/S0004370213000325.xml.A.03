<a href="#0" id="0">The overall cost of a search round i is thus {a mathematical formula} Α + Β (j), where j is the number of agents that comply with {a mathematical formula}ri.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The optimal sequence and its expected cost is determined by {a mathematical formula}C(0).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that there always exists a value P for which the expected cost of using the infinite sequence is less than the expected cost of using a single search when {a mathematical formula} Β (j)>0.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The expected total cost when using this strategy is:{a mathematical formula} in which {a mathematical formula}P=F(r1).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The figure also shows the reservation values to be used in each search round when {a mathematical formula}N=20.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For large values of Α and all {a mathematical formula} Β (j) cost functions, the reservation probability is set such that the expected number of search rounds is close to 1 due to the substantial cost of initiating a new search round.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The total cost of the search is {a mathematical formula}V(xmin,0)(S).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The optimal strategy can be derived with the following dynamic programming formulation, in which {a mathematical formula}C(l,k) is the cost of continuing the search after using reservation value {a mathematical formula}xl and after a total of k agents have been found so far.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The expected cost of applying a strategy {a mathematical formula}S=[r1, … ,rm=xmax] is thus similar to (4), except that {a mathematical formula} Β (j) is replaced with the cost {a mathematical formula}V(j,ri − 1,ri) of conducting the optimal sequential economic search on j items whose values are between the last two reservation values used, {a mathematical formula}ri − 1 and {a mathematical formula}ri.</a>
