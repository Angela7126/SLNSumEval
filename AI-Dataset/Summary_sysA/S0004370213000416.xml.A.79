<a href="#0" id="0">In the first part of Section 3 we have associated with any language for integrity constraints {a mathematical formula}L a class of aggregation procedures that are collectively rational with respect to all formulas in {a mathematical formula}L. Once a set of issues {a mathematical formula}I is fixed, {a mathematical formula}CR[ − ] can therefore be viewed as an operator from the set of languages for integrity constraints (i.e., subsets of {a mathematical formula}LPS closed under conjunction and logical equivalence and containing ⊤ and ⊥ ) to subsets of the class {a mathematical formula}F of all aggregation procedures for {a mathematical formula}I.</a>
