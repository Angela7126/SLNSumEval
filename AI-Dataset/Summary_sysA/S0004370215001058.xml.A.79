<a href="#0" id="0">However, for a given chance constraint h, T is clearly less than or equal to the cardinality {a mathematical formula}Ah of the assignment space constrained by h. {a mathematical formula}Ah can be computed as the cartesian product of the domains of the decision variables in the policy tree that are constrained by h. Since the property discussed in Proposition 5 applies to each chance constraint {a mathematical formula}h ∈ C, to compute an {a mathematical formula}( Α , Θ )-solution set we may introduce the following Bonferroni's correction [16], which is free of correlation and distribution assumptions, while computing N.</a>
