<a href="#0" id="0">[25] presents a general theoretical framework for statistical logical learning based on dynamic propositionalization, where structure learning corresponds to inferring a suitable kernel on logical objects, and parameter learning corresponds to function learning in the resulting reproducing kernel Hilbert space.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This definition allows faster convergence during the training of the model: the classical Fuzzy FOL formulation directly depends only on one item over the set of groundings (the argmin element), whereas the average depends on all elements and allows parallel optimization during training.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We assume that a set of H functional constraints in the form {a mathematical formula}1 − Φ h(f)=0,0 ≤ Φ h(f) ≤ 1,h=1, … ,H are provided in order to describe how the query functions should behave.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Enforcing the constraints only over the samples of data, yields the following cost function:{a mathematical formula} Please note that for the sake of simplicity (and with abuse of notation), the same symbol Φ was used to refer to both the exact and empirical approximation functionals.</a>
