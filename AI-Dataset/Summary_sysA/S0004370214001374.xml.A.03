<a href="#0" id="0">In our formulation, the upper-level policy is represented by a search distribution over Ω , {a mathematical formula} Π ( Ω ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Subsequently, we sample the lower-level controller parameter using the upper-level policy {a mathematical formula} Ω [i] ∼ Π ( Ω |s[i]).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, model-free REPS produces biased policy updates as the expected reward {a mathematical formula}Rs Ω is evaluated using a single rollout.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For data collection, we observe the context {a mathematical formula}s[i] and sample the parameters {a mathematical formula} Ω [i] using the upper-level policy {a mathematical formula} Π ( Ω |s[i]).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Subsequently, we use the lower-level control policy {a mathematical formula} Π (x; Ω [i]) to obtain the trajectory sample {a mathematical formula} Τ [i].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note, that we use solely the artificial context-parameter samples {a mathematical formula}{s[j], Ω [j]}j=1M to update the policy as to use the expected reward for the REPS algorithm instead of a single sample estimate of the reward.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, the upper-level policy is given by a Gaussian, {a mathematical formula} Π ( Ω )=N( Ω | Μ , Σ ).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The target position {a mathematical formula}s=[x,y] is uniformly distributed in a specified range, and we learn a contextual upper-level policy {a mathematical formula} Π ( Ω |s).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We also evaluated GPREPS when learning the expected reward model directly {a mathematical formula}Rs Ω =f(s, Ω ) as a function of the context and parameters Ω with a GP model (denoted by direct).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Furthermore, we evaluated GPREPS without decomposing the experiment, and directly predict the reward {a mathematical formula}Rs Ω with a GP model using the policy parameter Ω and the context s as input (GPREPS (direct)).</a>
