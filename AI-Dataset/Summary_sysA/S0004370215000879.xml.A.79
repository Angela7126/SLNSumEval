<a href="#0" id="0">While the proof of Theorem 2 could exploit the specific definition of the payments for position-dependent slots and it is a fairly simple extension of [20], in this case the proof is more complicated because of the dependency of the cumulative probabilities of observation on the actual allocations and decomposes the regret of the exploitation phase in components due to the different allocations ({a mathematical formula}f ˜ instead of {a mathematical formula}f ⁎ ) and the different qualities as well ({a mathematical formula}q ˜ i+ instead of {a mathematical formula}qi).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{sup:17} In particular, the theoretical bounds reveal the dependency of (expected) regret on characteristic parameters of the auction (i.e., T, N, K, and {a mathematical formula}qmin, and Μ if the mechanism is randomized).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First we notice that adopting the value of the parameters identified in Theorem 2 we obtain an upper bound {a mathematical formula}O ˜ (T23) for the global regret {a mathematical formula}RTSW.In order to find values that better optimize the bound over {a mathematical formula}RTSW, let {a mathematical formula}e:=1 Λ min, then we first simplify the previous bound as{a mathematical formula} Taking the derivative of the previous bound w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First we notice that adopting the value of the parameters identified in Theorem 14 we obtain an upper bound {a mathematical formula}O ˜ (T23) for the global regret {a mathematical formula}RTSW.In order to find values that better optimize the bound over {a mathematical formula}RTSW, it is possible to use the procedure followed in the proof of Theorem 3 with {a mathematical formula}e:=1 Γ min:{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We start computing the per-step regret over the SW during the exploitation phase.First of all we introduce the following definition: {a mathematical formula}S ′ ={s ′ |s ′ ∈ {0,1}N, Π (i;f ⁎ (v ˆ )) ≤ K ⇒ si ′ =1}, i.e., the set of the random realization where the cSRP does not modify the bids of the ads displayed when the allocation function is {a mathematical formula}f ⁎ is applied to the true bids {a mathematical formula}v ˆ .We now provide the bound over the regret.</a>
