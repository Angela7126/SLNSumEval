<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}c,b: conjecture (c – current conjecture, b – new conjecture)</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">4 visualises the AIF structure available after proponent has offered a putative proof for a conjecture, c, based on lemmas {a mathematical formula}L1, {a mathematical formula}L2 and {a mathematical formula}L3.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Opponent's {a mathematical formula}GlobalCounter(m,c) performs a total of four updates to the AIF structure.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}ODefinition allows Opponent to offer an alternative definition, which requires update to the AIF structure not only to include the new definition, e, but also (i) the conflict with Proponent's definition and (ii) the inference from e to Opponent's reason, s, for thinking the counterexample holds.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For PiecemealExclusion(b), the revised conjecture, b is added to the AIF, and consequently {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {b}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This also adds C as an argument to the {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ framework, and to the abstract argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This is in conflict ({a mathematical formula}CA8 and {a mathematical formula}CA9) with the lemma, {a mathematical formula}L3, one of the premises of the abstract argument, Ω , representing the proposed proof, and hence Ω is no longer in the grounded extension (Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Having introduced the revised lemma, K, the Proponent now performs the ProofDone move to incorporate this new lemma into the proof structure.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The result of this move is to create a new rule of inference, {a mathematical formula}RA6, between the current lemmas ({a mathematical formula}L1, {a mathematical formula}L2, K) and the conjecture (C), this produces a new abstract argument {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ , which replaces Ω as the current proof (Fig.</a>
