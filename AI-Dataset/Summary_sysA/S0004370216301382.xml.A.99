<a href="#0" id="0">To evaluate the efficiency and the robustness of our CCEHC algorithm, we compare CCEHC against CCLS, Dist and DistUP on a broad range of WPMS benchmarks including the random, crafted and industrial benchmarks from the MAX-SAT Evaluation 2014 as well as four real-world application benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Experimental results clearly show that CCEHC generally performs much better than CCLS, Dist and DistUP, and thus establishes a new state of the art on SLS algorithms for solving WPMS.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also conduct more experiments to study the performance variability of SLS algorithms on selected instances.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The comparative results of CCEHC and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors DistUP, Dist and CCLS on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and four real-world application WPMS benchmarks are summarized in Table 4.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">According to the empirical results presented in Table 4, although CCEHC performs slightly slower than CCLS on the benchmark of advanced encryption standard and performs slightly slower than DistUP and Dist on the benchmark of cluster expansion, it is very apparent that, among these four competing SLS algorithms, our CCEHC algorithm performs best on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and two real-world application WPMS benchmarks (i.e., ‘ Computational Protein Design ’ and ‘ Pedigree ’ ).</a>
