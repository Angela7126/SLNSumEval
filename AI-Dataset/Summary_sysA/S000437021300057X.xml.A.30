<a href="#1" id="1">In a new TurKontrol(2) version, we do everything the same as TurKontrol(2) except we regard every worker as an anonymous worker of the same, average accuracy, {a mathematical formula} Γ ¯.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Specifically, we repeat the previous experiment using the same error coefficient, {a mathematical formula} Γ w, for each worker ʼ s improvement and ballot behavior (Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The answer {a mathematical formula}bwk that worker w with error parameter {a mathematical formula} Γ wk provides for a task using workflow k is governed by the following equations:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} As before, an underlying assumption is that given the workflow difficulty, {a mathematical formula}dk, and the true answer v, the {a mathematical formula}bwk ʼ s are independent of each other.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Δ encodes the assumption that workflows may not be independent of each other.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As before, we assume that every future worker is an average worker.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In other words, for a given workflow k, every future worker has an error parameter equal to {a mathematical formula} Γ ¯k=1W ∑ w Γ wk where W is the number of workers.</a>
