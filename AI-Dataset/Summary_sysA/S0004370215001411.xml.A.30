<a href="#0" id="0">An indefinite horizon Markov Decision Process with Imprecise Probabilities, also called a Stochastic Shortest Path MDP-IP (SSP MDP-IP) is a sequential decision process with states, actions, a cost function, a set of goal states and an initial state, like an SSP MDP, but with a transition probability function that can be imprecisely defined.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That is, an SSP MDP-IP is an extension of an SSP MDP where, instead of a probability distribution {a mathematical formula}P( ⋅ |s,a) over the state space S, there is a set of probability distributions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In practice, Value Iteration for SSP MDP-IPs is stopped when:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}S ′ is the set of states reachable from {a mathematical formula}s0 under some greedy policy Π w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Factored SSP MDP-IPFormally a Factored SSP MDP-IP is defined by {a mathematical formula} 〈 X → ,A,C,K,G,x → 0 〉 where A is defined as for any SSP MDP-IP, {a mathematical formula}X → is a vector of n state variables {a mathematical formula}(X1, … ,Xn), C is a factored cost function, {a mathematical formula}K is a set of factored transition credal sets (Definition 4.2), G is a set of goal states and {a mathematical formula}x → 0 the initial state.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For enumerated SSP MDP-IPs we assume state and action pair independence (Assumption 3.2).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the case of factored SSP MDP-IP, instead of assuming independence for single states we now assume independence for abstract states, i.e., a set of states that are defined by the partial assignment of {a mathematical formula}paa(Xi ′ ).</a>
