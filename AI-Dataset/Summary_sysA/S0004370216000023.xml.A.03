<a href="#0" id="0">Let K be a belief set and {a mathematical formula}S be a system of spheres centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Such definition makes use of the concept of {a mathematical formula}Sfiltration of a set of sentences B,{sup:6} where {a mathematical formula}S is a system of spheres centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ , for some given belief set K:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let K be a belief set and {a mathematical formula}S be a system of spheres centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, in the following counterexample we present a transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction function ÷ on a belief set K which is different from the {a mathematical formula}S filtration-based multiple contraction {a mathematical formula}÷S, for any system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .</a>
