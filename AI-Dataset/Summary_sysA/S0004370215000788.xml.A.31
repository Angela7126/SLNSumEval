<a href="#0" id="0">In Section 2, we formally introduce the problem of optimal ordering for sequential auctions (OOSA), and then we show how to learn regression models from historical auction data in Section 3 using standard machine learning methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Based on the learned models, our white-box optimization method and a black-box optimization are introduced to find the optimal ordering for OOSA in Section 4.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Extensive experiments are presented in Section 5 where we compare the performance of the two proposed optimization methods using both the learned models and the auction simulator.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We first give an overview in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">1 of the connection between the regression models and the optimization models for solving OOSA.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given historical auction data, a regression tree (or a LASSO linear regression function) is learned for each item type.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The regression tree (or LASSO) can be used to evaluate the values of selling different items based on the feature values that are computed on a given ordering of the items.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The learned regression trees (or LASSO functions) are then used in two ways to model the optimization problem OOSA: (1) Black-box optimization.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this paper, we use a best-first search heuristic to come up orderings of the items, and then use the learned regression trees (or LASSO) to compute the expected revenue of these orderings; (2) White-box optimization.</a>
