<a href="#0" id="0">In this section, we use the phrase “ constraint condition ” to denote how to assemble candidate features with specific relevant information.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Constraint conditions are employed to generate combined features and to capture local dependency information.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For every candidate feature, an appropriate constraint condition is selected for its assembly with relevant information to maximize the discrimination power.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Based on the constraint conditions, our feature assembly method summarizes the techniques used in feature combinations, thereby providing a more systematic way to assemble the candidate features.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Table 5, the weak performance of the collection constraint is because relation arguments (entity) are order sensitive, so the collective features cannot capture local dependency information in this situation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For example, in entity type and subtype, each collective feature (e.g., {person, location}) appears in both the positive and negative instances with almost identical distributions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish them using only this feature.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this study, we proposed a feature assembly method, where utilizing six constraint conditions, the assembled features can capture the local dependency from relation instances.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We also described the omni-word feature in detail.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Both the feature assembly method and omni-word feature can make better use of the information in a sentence.</a>
