<a href="#0" id="0">Temporally Controllable ActivityGiven an activity and associated plant, and given a Valid Control Policy, P, for the activity, the activity is Temporally Controllable by P in the duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u] if the activity is Temporally Feasible in this range, and if all trajectories for the activity are consistent with (generated by) P. A trajectory is consistent with, or generated by P if for every state {a mathematical formula}x(k) in the trajectory, the subsequent state {a mathematical formula}x(k+1) results from applying P to {a mathematical formula}x(k).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The executive's dispatcher component executes a QCP output by the plan compiler.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To execute a QCP, the dispatcher must successfully execute each control activity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The dispatcher accomplishes this by, in real time, monitoring plant state, and generating plant control inputs based on the appropriate QCP control policy for the current state and time.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This causes the state trajectory of the linearized sub-systems to reach activity goal regions at acceptable times.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this way, the dispatcher indirectly schedules start and finish events so that they are consistent with the temporal constraints of the QCP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This is a key difference between our dispatcher, and those of discrete activity execution systems [9], in which event times are set directly by the dispatcher.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Dispatchable Executing QCPGiven a Plant Model (Definition 1), a QCP (Definition 19) that is dispatchable according toTheorem 1, and the current statex, suppose that each activity{a mathematical formula}aiin the set of currently executing activities is Temporally Controllable in the duration range{a mathematical formula}[li,ui]for the current state according toLemma 5.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let N be the Simple Temporal Network formed by combining the temporal constraints of the QCP before execution, with the duration range temporal constraints{a mathematical formula}[li,ui]for the currently executing activities.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If N is dispatchable[9], then a trajectory and schedule exist that satisfy successful execution of the QCP.</a>
