<a href="#0" id="0">These structural relationships among data samples imply their underlying data group/cluster relations (obtained using a standard graph based clustering algorithm on the similarity graph estimated by our HML-RF model), as well as the specific tag concept structures of individual samples (predicted using the discovered semantic neighbourhoods encoded in the tree structures of HML-RF).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We made these observations: (1) The layer number of tag hierarchy can affect the results of data structure discovery by our HML-RF model; (2) The NUS-WIDE tags may lie in multiple abstractness layers, which leads to better discovered cluster structure than that by two layers; (3) The performance starts to get saturated from five layers and appending further more layers has little effect on data structure discovery, probably due to that over specific tags have little influence on data structure.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These findings imply the effectiveness and robustness of HML-RF in accommodating tag hierarchies of various structures and qualities.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These observations and analysis demonstrate the superiority of our HML-RF in instance-level tag completion, owing to its favourable capability in jointly learning heterogeneous visual and tag data and thus more accurate semantic visual structure disclosure.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 8, Table 7 show the comparative results for tag completion on the NUS-WIDE image dataset [10], where the available tags are more sparse ({a mathematical formula}0.48%) as compared to the TRECVID MED 2011 video dataset ({a mathematical formula}3.5%).</a>
