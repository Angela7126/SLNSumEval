<a href="#1" id="1">Table 4 presents detailed numbers of solved instances for each benchmark family in the set eval2012r2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the original set eval2012r2 solvers with built-in preprocessing outperform solvers that do not have built-in preprocessing, as shown in Table 3.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 8 shows the rankings of the solvers for each of the seven randomly sampled benchmark sets according to the numbers of solved instances.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 12 shows the number of instances solved by each execution sequence.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As illustrated by Table 15, the numbers of instances solved by preprocessing using a particular execution sequence is sensitive to the ordering of the preprocessing tools in the sequence.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Furthermore, the total number of instances solved by preprocessing and by solving is different for the two benchmark sets.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the set AADDBBCC, 104 instances were solved by preprocessing (third line in Table 15) and 104 by the best solver (first line in Table 17), which gives 208 solved instances in total.</a>
