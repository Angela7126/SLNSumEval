<a href="#1" id="1">The matrix in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">1 gives structure to the research landscape in the field of integrated AI and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We believe that it is the research questions at the intersections of the rows and columns in this matrix that characterize this field.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Coming with a well-defined set of such questions would be an important first step to define a much needed science of integrated AI and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The papers in this Special Issue contribute to this process, by addressing an interesting sample of questions across such a landscape.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Six of the contributions in this Special Issue have the acquisition or representation of knowledge as their center of gravity.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">These are highlighted in blue in Fig.</a>
