<a href="#0" id="0">1, the learning framework consists of four steps: 1) Base training: training a baseline system using annotated data and base features; 2) Processing: using the baseline system to annotate a large amount of raw sentences and obtain auto-labeled data; 3) Feature bucketing: performing feature transformation from base features to meta features; 4) Final training: training a new system with both the base and meta features.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The key step of the framework is feature bucketing, in which we use a transformation function to group the base feature instances from automatically annotated data into clusters, and define a set of meta features based on the clusters.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on the above work, we defined a set of base feature templates listed in Table 1, where h, d refer to the head, the dependent respectively, c refers to d's sibling or child, +1 ( âˆ’ 1) refers to the next (previous) word, w and p refer to the surface word and part-of-speech tag respectively, {a mathematical formula}dir(h,d) is the direction of the dependency relation between h and d, {a mathematical formula}[wp] refers to w or p, and {a mathematical formula}dir(h,d,c) is the directions of the relation among h, d, and c. For example, for the words {a mathematical formula}h=ate, {a mathematical formula}d=with, and {a mathematical formula}c=fish in Fig.</a>
