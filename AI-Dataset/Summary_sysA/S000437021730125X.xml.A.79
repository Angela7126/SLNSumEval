<a href="#0" id="0">We provide an upper bound on the number of times the algorithm selects a suboptimal expert set for a given problem, which depends on the target accuracy level and the true qualities (Theorem 4.2).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The output of the algorithm will be the subset {a mathematical formula}St and predicted opinion {a mathematical formula}y ˆ t for each task t. The predicted opinion {a mathematical formula}y ˆ t is decided based on an aggregation function (AGGREGATE) in Definition 4.1 with noisy opinions {a mathematical formula}y ˜ (St) collected from the expert set {a mathematical formula}St as input.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since the optimization problem involves cost minimization and quality updates are the same:{a mathematical formula} Since {a mathematical formula}i ∉ S(c ˆ i), the selected set {a mathematical formula}S(c ˆ i) satisfies the lower confidence bound too (exploitation round with bid {a mathematical formula}c ˆ i) and thus for the rest of the tasks, only {a mathematical formula}S(c ˆ i) is selected and thus we have, {a mathematical formula}Ait(c ˆ i,c − i) ≤ Ait(ci,c − i).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By safely, we mean that with qualities known perfectly, GA algorithm has a candidate solution of cost less than or equal to any candidate solution containing r with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ) and there is no need to consider expert r for the future tasks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If an expert r does not belong to{an inline-figure}for some task t in CCB-SE, then, with known qualities, GA algorithm has a candidate solution of cost less than or equal to any candidate solution containing r with probability{a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ).With true qualities, in GA algorithm, the elements {a mathematical formula}1, … ,k precedes r due to {a mathematical formula}cka ˆ k − ≤ cra ˆ r+ with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ).As {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,k} meets the accuracy constraint with LCB, they meet it with true qualities also (with high probability).</a>
