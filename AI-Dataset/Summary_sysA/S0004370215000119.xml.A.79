<a href="#0" id="0">The weak Ε -core for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ requires that the payoff vector be efficient.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To find an efficient payoff vector, we need to know the exact value of {a mathematical formula}V(CS ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since finding its exact value is NP-hard, it is natural to utilize an approximate, semi-optimal solution against the weak Ε -core for {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We introduce a new solution concept called the weak Ε -core{sup:+}, which can be obtained by an approximate value of {a mathematical formula}V(CS ⁎ ), and define it as follows.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since the nucleolus always exists and is uniquely determined, we focus on the weak least core [20] for the optimal coalition structure and the weak least {a mathematical formula}core+, i.e., the solution concepts with the least value Ε with which they are guaranteed to exist.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Assume there exists a payoff vector y such that it is not in the weak least core (for the optimal coalition structure), but in the weak nucleolus (for the optimal coalition structure).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}y ′ be a payoff vector from the weak least core.</a>
