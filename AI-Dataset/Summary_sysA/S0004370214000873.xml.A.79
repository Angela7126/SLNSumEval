<a href="#0" id="0">Observe that {a mathematical formula} Β ′ is consistent, hence each of {a mathematical formula} Α ′ and {a mathematical formula} Β ′ is a {a mathematical formula}K/H formula and renH formula.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a consequence, each of them also belongs to {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∨ , ∃ ], and {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ , ∃ ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, both {a mathematical formula} Α ′ and {a mathematical formula} Β ′ can be computed in time polynomial in the size of Α .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By construction, Α is consistent iff {a mathematical formula} Α ′ ∧ Β ′ is consistent.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If any of {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∨ , ∃ ], or {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ , ∃ ] would satisfy ∧ BC, since each of these languages satisfy CO, we would have {a mathematical formula}P=NP.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The non-representability results for KROM, HORN, {a mathematical formula}K/H, renH, AFF, {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∃ ], {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∃ ], {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∃ ] come directly from the corresponding non-representability results for ∨ BC.</a>
