<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, the language DDNF satisfies the property called {a mathematical formula} ∧ C, i.e., there exists a polytime algorithm that maps every finite set of formulas {a mathematical formula} Σ 1, … , Σ n from DDNF to a formula of DDNF that is equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Σ 1 ∧ … ∧ Σ n which appears to be contradictory with the statement on the time complexity of computing {a mathematical formula} Φ Μ DNF stated at the end of Section 4.1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By Definition 5, to prove that {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊕ R Ψ is an enabling form of Φ for a, we prove that {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊕ R Ψ is a set of {a mathematical formula}R-states enabling for a, i.e., every {a mathematical formula} Ψ i in {a mathematical formula} Ψ (a) is known in every {a mathematical formula}R-state in {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊕ R Ψ , and {a mathematical formula} ⋃ Γ ∈ Φ ⊕ R Ψ BS( Γ )=BS( Φ ).</a>
