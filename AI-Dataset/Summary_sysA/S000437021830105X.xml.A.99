<a href="#0" id="0">First we will show that deciding the satisfiability of a general {a mathematical formula}ILPb task is in NP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We do this by mapping an arbitrary task {a mathematical formula}T= 〈 B,SM, 〈 E+,E − 〉 〉 to an ASP program whose answer sets can be mapped to the solutions of T. This program will be satisfiable if and only if T is satisfiable and as the program is aggregate stratified, checking whether the program is satisfiable is in NP.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, if we can construct such a program then we will have proved that deciding satisfiability for {a mathematical formula}ILPb is in NP.For each {a mathematical formula}Ri ∈ SM we define a new atom {a mathematical formula}in_hRi.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Also, let {a mathematical formula}meta(Ri) be the rule {a mathematical formula}Ri with the additional atom {a mathematical formula}in_hRi added to the body.We define the meta encoding {a mathematical formula}Tmeta as follows:{a mathematical formula}For any answer set A, let {a mathematical formula}M − 1(A)={Ri|Ri ∈ SM,in_hRi ∈ A}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}A ∈ AS(Tmeta) if and only if {a mathematical formula}(A\{in_hRi|Ri ∈ SM}) ∈ AS(B ∪ M − 1(A) ∪ {:-note.|e ∈ E+} ∪ {:-e.|e ∈ E − }).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">(This can be seen by using the splitting set theorem, with {a mathematical formula}{in_hRi|Ri ∈ SM} as the splitting set.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">)Hence {a mathematical formula}A ∈ AS(Tmeta) if and only if {a mathematical formula} ∃ H ⊆ SM such that {a mathematical formula}H=M − 1(A), {a mathematical formula}(A\{in_hRi|Ri ∈ SM}) ∈ AS(B ∪ H) and A respects the examples.Hence {a mathematical formula}Tmeta is satisfiable if and only if {a mathematical formula} ∃ H ⊆ SM such that {a mathematical formula} ∃ A ∈ AS(B ∪ H) such that A respects the examples.</a>
