<a href="#0" id="0">This allows us to show, for instance, that System {a mathematical formula}A is sound and complete for the inference of arbitrary CI statements from sets of saturated CI statements relative to both the class of all binary probability measures and the class of all discrete probability measures.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}I(A,B|C) be a CI statement, and let {a mathematical formula}F ∈ F be a real-valued function such that {a mathematical formula} ⊨ FaI(A,B|C).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that {a mathematical formula} Δ F(V)=0, for each {a mathematical formula}V ∈ L(A,B|C).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The proof goes by downward induction on {a mathematical formula}L(A,B|C).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By Proposition 7, we have {a mathematical formula}L(A,B|C)= ⋃ W ∈ W(I(A,B|C))[C,W¯].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence, for the base case, we must prove that {a mathematical formula} Δ F(W¯)=0, for each {a mathematical formula}W ∈ W(A,B|C).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}W={a,b} ∈ W(I(A,B|C)), with {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A and {a mathematical formula}b ∈ B.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Now, {a mathematical formula}I(a,b|C ∪ (A − {a}) ∪ (B − {b})) is derivable from {a mathematical formula}I(A,B|C) using weak union and symmetry.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Furthermore, {a mathematical formula}I(a,b|W¯) is derivable from {a mathematical formula}I(a,b|C ∪ (A − {a}) ∪ (B − {b})) using strong union, since {a mathematical formula}C ∪ (A − {a}) ∪ (B − {b}) ⊆ W¯.</a>
