<a href="#0" id="0">In general, a basic action theory {a mathematical formula}D is a set of sentences consisting of (free variables understood as universally quantified from the outside):</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Step (a) expands P. In step (b), owing to the fact that sensing actions do not change fluent values (by our first assumption tailored to Bayesian conditioning), {a mathematical formula} Φ [do(a, Ι )] is equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Φ [ Ι ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Following [5], perhaps the simplest extension to make all this precise is to assume that deterministic actions such as {a mathematical formula}move(x) now have companion action types {a mathematical formula}move(x,y) in {a mathematical formula}L. The intuition is that x represents the nominal value, which is the number of units that the agent intends to move, while y represents the actual distance moved.</a>
