<a href="#0" id="0">On the other hand, termination of a program is proved by showing that the new natural number constants introduced by the loops and used in the smallest macro expressions are well-defined, which in logic means that the resulting theory {a mathematical formula} Π PX → is consistent, thus there is a model where the new constants are mapped to natural numbers.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula} Π PX → is equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Π OuterX → ∪ {Q=0,R=X}.</a>
