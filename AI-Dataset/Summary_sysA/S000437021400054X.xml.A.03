<a href="#0" id="0">For an interpretation I to be an answer set of a logic program Π , the FLP answer set semantics only requires I to be a minimal model of the FLP reduct {a mathematical formula}f Π I.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Under the FLP answer set semantics, Π is identified with {a mathematical formula} Π ′ and I is an FLP answer set of Π if and only if it is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This FLP answer set has a circular justification similar to that of {a mathematical formula} Π 2 in Example 2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">I is an FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 1, but it is not a well-justified FLP answer set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Observe that when {a mathematical formula}I ˆ is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ , I may not be an FLP or a well-justified FLP answer set of Π , and even not be a model of Π .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let {a mathematical formula}I ˆ be an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ and I be its projection on Π .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">( ⟹ ) Let I be an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set of Π with {a mathematical formula}l ∈ I.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">So I is also an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">( ⟸ ) Let {a mathematical formula} Π 1 have an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set I.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore, if Π has no FLP or well-justified FLP answer set, then {a mathematical formula} Π 1 has no FLP or well-justified FLP answer set.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, p trivially belongs to every FLP or well-justified FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If Π has an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set I, then p belongs to the FLP or well-justified FLP answer set {a mathematical formula}I ∪ {p} of {a mathematical formula} Π 2.</a>
