<a href="#0" id="0">This assumption is reasonable as the effect of agents working in a team is captured by the compatibility function and their distance in the weighted synergy graph, so the variables representing their individual capabilities ({a mathematical formula}Ci,Cj) are independent.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this way, neighbor teams are generated from the current best estimate {a mathematical formula}Abest so as to effectively explore the space of possible teams of size n. The value of the neighbor team {a mathematical formula}vneighbor is computed with Evaluate, and the team is accepted or rejected based on the criteria of the approximation algorithm (e.g., simulated annealing uses a temperature schedule).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Specifically, let O be the set of observations, where {a mathematical formula} ∀ A ∈ A2,3, {a mathematical formula} ∃ oA,1, … ,oA,M such that each {a mathematical formula}oA,m is an observation of the performance of the team A at the task.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since any subset of agents will attain a performance value at the task, and the synergy function {a mathematical formula}S is computed from the pairwise synergy function {a mathematical formula}S2, the observation set O is sufficient for learning.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, {a mathematical formula}A2 provides information about the shortest distance between pairs of agents and the agents ʼ capabilities using the pairwise synergy function {a mathematical formula}S2 (Definition 3.7).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, there are multiple solutions for any pairwise synergy (increasing capabilities versus decreasing distances), and {a mathematical formula}A3 provides information about the overall structure of the graph using the synergy function {a mathematical formula}S (Definition 3.8), and provides additional constraints to the learning problem.</a>
