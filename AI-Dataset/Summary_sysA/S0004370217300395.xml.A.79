<a href="#0" id="0">For all {a mathematical formula}DLN subsumptions and assertions Α , {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Α holds iff {a mathematical formula}KB Σ ⊨ Α , where Σ is any set of normality concepts that contains at least the normality concepts that explicitly occur in {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α }, and {a mathematical formula}KB Σ is a classical knowledge base obtained as follows (recall that {a mathematical formula}KB=S ∪ D):</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, under the refined semantics, the restriction of {a mathematical formula}DLN to N-free knowledge bases is almost rational with respect to the postulates in Table 4; the only difference is that CM applies only to consistent normality concepts, as discussed in the previous section.</a>
