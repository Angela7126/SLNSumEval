<a href="#0" id="0">We created 100 problem instances for each parameter setting and compared the outcomes of four mechanisms (TTCR, TTCR-SS, ACDA, and PLDA-MQ) and a trivial mechanism that assigns each student to her initial endowment school, i.e., it always returns {a mathematical formula}X ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is clear that {a mathematical formula}(s,c ″ ) ∈ ChS(X ′ ∪ {(s,c ″ )}) holds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the procedure of Lemma 8, when calculating {a mathematical formula}ChC(X ′ ∪ {(s,c ″ )}), {a mathematical formula}(s,c ″ ) is selected before {a mathematical formula}(s ′ ,c ′ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the calculation of {a mathematical formula}ChC(X ′ ), when {a mathematical formula}(s ′ ,c ′ ) is selected, {a mathematical formula}f ˆ (Y ∪ {(s ′ ,c ′ )})=0 holds since {a mathematical formula}X ′ =ChC(X ′ ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the calculation of {a mathematical formula}ChC(X ′ ∪ {(s,c ″ )}), when {a mathematical formula}(s,c ″ ) is selected, {a mathematical formula}f ˆ (Y ∪ {(s,c ″ )})=0 also holds since {a mathematical formula}|Xc ″ ′ |<qc ″ and {a mathematical formula}|Xc ′ ′ |>pc ′ hold.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then {a mathematical formula}(s,c ″ ) ∈ ChC(X ′ ∪ {(s,c ″ )}) holds; {a mathematical formula}X ′ is not HM-stable.Third, assume {a mathematical formula}X ′ is HM-stable but not PL-nonwasteful, i.e., there exist {a mathematical formula}(s,c) ∈ X ′ and {a mathematical formula}(s,c ′ ) ∈ X ∖ X ′ such that {a mathematical formula}(s,c ′ ) ≻ s(s,c), {a mathematical formula}|Xc ′ ′ |<qc ′ , {a mathematical formula}|Xc ′ |>pc, and {a mathematical formula}(s,c ′ ) ≻ PL(s,c) hold.</a>
