<a href="#0" id="0">Abstraction heuristic [12]Let Α be an abstraction with an associated abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula} Α 1 and {a mathematical formula} Α 2 be two abstractions of a given state space Θ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, abstract state 1 of {a mathematical formula} Π 1 ⊗ Π 2 represents states in which package 2 is in the truck and package 1 is at L. The abstraction in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For each abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α i, we perform a backward uniform-cost search {a mathematical formula}UCSi on its abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α i.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After constructing a perimeter around the goal, the search frontier is relaxed into an abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Α 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, each phase i consists of a backward uniform-cost search in the abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α i initialized with the perimeter frontier of search {a mathematical formula}i − 1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Algorithm 3 can be adapted to compute the ADD representation of the M&S abstraction function (that maps states in S to abstract states in {a mathematical formula}Sn Α ) by assigning to terminal nodes the id of each abstract state instead of their heuristic value.</a>
