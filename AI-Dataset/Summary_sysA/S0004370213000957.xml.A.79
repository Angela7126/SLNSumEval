<a href="#0" id="0">This result yields immediate correspondence of all operator-based semantics of an ADF Ξ with the respective semantics of its standard logic program {a mathematical formula} Π ( Ξ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let{a mathematical formula} Ξ =(S,L,Cin)be an abstract dialectical framework and{a mathematical formula} Π ( Ξ )its standard logic program.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then Ξ and{a mathematical formula} Π ( Ξ )coincide on all semantics based on their approximation operators.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We begin with the simplest semantics: recall that for {a mathematical formula} Θ =(A,R) a set E of arguments is a stable extension iff {a mathematical formula}E=U Θ (E), so the following is immediate.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For AFs {a mathematical formula} Θ =(A,R), the definition of its standard logic program can be simplified to the following:{a mathematical formula}Note that the positive body is empty in general since there is no notion of support in classical Dung-style AFs.</a>
