<a href="#0" id="0">We use AI planning as a general framework to tackle the temporal voltage control problem in an active distribution network.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Section 5 we present the necessary fundamentals of power systems, with emphasis on the voltage control problem for distribution systems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The decision variables are the tap ratios of transformers, the status of the capacitors and reactors and the level of power demand that can be shed from the network, while the network has to respect the voltage constraint:{a mathematical formula} where N is the total number of busbars present in the network.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore the AC voltage control problem is a BTMP.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, in the AC voltage control domain, the {a mathematical formula}Vdep variables are the tap settings which are changed when the planner applies an action to step a transformer up (or down).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By contrast, the AC Voltage Control problem is in the top right quadrant.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This arises in the AC voltage control problem in the following way.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We have addressed the problem of AC voltage control by extending the planner popf2, to popf-tif, along two dimensions: Timed Initial Fluents on one dimension and integration with a specialised power flow equation solver on the other.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The steady state AC power flow for the busbar k is then given by:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Vk is the complex voltage {a mathematical formula}Vkej Δ k and j is the complex square root of − 1.</a>
