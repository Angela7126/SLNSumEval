<a href="#0" id="0">The goal is to achieve a belief state in which {a mathematical formula} Φ G holds, i.e., {a mathematical formula}b ⊨ Φ G.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An action a is applicable given the initial belief state {a mathematical formula}bI and an action – observation sequence {a mathematical formula}a¯,o¯ if a is applicable in {a mathematical formula} Τ (bI,a¯,o¯).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For {a mathematical formula} Φ =¬p, the proof is identical.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula} Φ = Φ 1 ∧ Φ 2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The same holds for {a mathematical formula} Φ = Φ 1 ∨ Φ 2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, {a mathematical formula}s ⊨ rga( Φ ) iff a is applicable in s and {a mathematical formula}a(s) ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, the regression of observations that were received throughout the execution of an action sequence may involve variables that appear in {a mathematical formula} Ω a,o, yet are not relevant for any primitive proposition in Φ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It implies that following an observation o via action a, we can conjoin the regression of {a mathematical formula} Ω a,o to the initial state independently of the condition Φ we are checking.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, once the regression of {a mathematical formula} Ω a,o is conjoined with the initial state, we can simply ignore this observation in future regressions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As the regression of the formula {a mathematical formula} Ω a,o → Φ makes the decomposition of the regression operator more complex, regression over deterministic actions avoiding the observations decomposes conveniently.</a>
