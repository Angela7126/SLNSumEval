<a href="#0" id="0">After that, we present experimental results for both the original SimStudent and the extended SimStudent trained with problem sets used by real students in learning algebra, and show that the extended SimStudent is able to achieve performance comparable to the original SimStudent without requiring domain-specific knowledge as input.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It will fail when the perceptual information learner cannot find one path that covers all demonstrated steps, or the operator sequence learner cannot find one operator function sequence that explains all records.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since previous research on algebra problem solving has pointed out that computational parsimony is an important factor in a quality cognitive model of human problem solving [28], when faced with a new task, the learning algorithm uses the existing grammar from previous tasks to build the smallest number of most probable parse trees for the new records.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to further understand how transfer learning affects learning efficiency, we carried out a second experiment where the previous grammar is not a subset of the current grammar.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to understand the behavior of the proposed model, we designed three sequences of learning tasks of increasing difficulties.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A careful inspection shows that without feature focus and transfer learning, the base learner was not able to acquire a grammar rule with a non-terminal symbol generally corresponding with the feature “ coefficient ” , though it does learn to identify positive coefficients (like many novice students).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In order to both reduce the amount of prior knowledge engineering needed for SimStudent and to build a better model of real students, we present a novel approach that integrates the representation learner into SimStudent.</a>
