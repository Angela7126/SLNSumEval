<a href="#0" id="0">Even worse, {a mathematical formula}(1,2) is not less informative than any of the answers {a mathematical formula}Q(D ′ ) for {a mathematical formula}D ′ ∈ 〚 D 〛 which are of the form {a mathematical formula}{(1,2),(3,n)} for different values n. Indeed, under the closed world semantics, the answer {a mathematical formula}{(1,2)} contains additional information that no tuple except {a mathematical formula}(1,2) is present.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that this definition requires that both the input database D, and the answer A, be interpreted under the same semantics {a mathematical formula} 〚 〛 .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The intuition behind the ‘ enough objects ’ condition is that for every such renaming f of elements of the active domain, {a mathematical formula}f(D) is a legitimate database, and D and {a mathematical formula}f(D) agree on formulae that only mention constants preserved by f.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We look at certain information contained in sets {a mathematical formula} 〚 x 〛 and prove that, as expected, it is represented at the object level by x itself, and at the knowledge level by {a mathematical formula} Δ x, defining the semantics of x.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If it does not, it simply means that the semantics {a mathematical formula} 〚 〛 ′ of query answers was chosen incorrectly.</a>
