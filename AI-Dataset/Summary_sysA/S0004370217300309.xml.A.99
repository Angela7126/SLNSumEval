<a href="#0" id="0">Our results provide some support for this rational: in more than 70% of the observations in all the examined Boolean circuits systems, the health state has converged to a Ε -stable value (using the AUC metric) without requiring any diagnosis that is not of minimal cardinality.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using the Euclidean distance metric, almost all the observations (more than 90%) needed only to compute minimal cardinality diagnoses to obtain a Ε -stable health state.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, in most cases, limiting the DA to find only minimal cardinality diagnoses seems to be a reasonable choice.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, a high-quality health state can be found with only a subset of all minimal cardinality diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 13, Table 14 show the ratio of minimal cardinality diagnoses (where 1 corresponds to all minimal cardinality diagnoses) required on average, to reach a Ε -stable health state using AUC and Euclidean metrics respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As can be seen, even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1, only a fraction of the minimal cardinality diagnoses are needed to reach a Ε -stable health state.</a>
