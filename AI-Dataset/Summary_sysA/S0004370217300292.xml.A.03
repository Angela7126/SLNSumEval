<a href="#0" id="0">So, by moving all buyers of type i from vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ to vendor j, we still have an assignment that is consistent to p in which the utilities of buyers and vendors do not change.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We claim that this price vector together with the consistent assignment x that assigns the buyers to vendor {a mathematical formula}j ⁎ is an equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, the only reason that may prevent vendor j from increasing its price is that there is a buyer of type i assigned to j in x and another vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ such that {a mathematical formula}vij − q¯j=vij ′ − q¯j ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then, the only reason that may prevent vendor j from increasing its price is that there is a buyer of type i assigned to j in x and another vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ such that {a mathematical formula}vij − q¯j=vij ′ − q¯j ′ .</a>
