<a href="#0" id="0">Observe that the definition establishes that in a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[T,S] the source S cannot be in any place in T. A discussion considering the reasons for having this restriction is included in Section 9.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although our contraction operator can produce a change that is not minimal with respect to the number of credibility objects in the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, the change is minimal as discussed in [27].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, we will define a function {a mathematical formula}Rl((A,B),C) that given a credibility tuple {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ Cl(C), returns a set of agent identifiers that represent the reliability of {a mathematical formula}(A,B) with respect to {a mathematical formula}C. Recall that the function Sources returns a set of agent identifiers (Definition 16) and that {a mathematical formula}C(A − B) represents the set of all paths from A to B.</a>
