<a href="#0" id="0">These three challenges, communication, joint action, human-aware execution, structure the research in human – robot interaction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, if the human says “ this ” without the robot tracking what the human points at, no 〈 HUMAN1 pointsAt ... 〉 fact is possibly available in the knowledge base, and the robot falls back on the anaphora resolution step alone.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As HATP is a generic symbolic task planner and does not enforce any abstraction level for the planning domain, we have designed a planning domain made of top-level tasks whose semantics are close to the one used in the human – robot dialogue: the planner domain effectively contains concepts like Give, table, isOn.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This leads to an effective mapping between the knowledge extracted from the situation assessment or the dialogue, and the planner.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">They would need to be accounted for when grounding human – robot interaction.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have presented in this paper an instance of a complete deliberative architecture designed for social robots.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">While most of its sub-components have been independently presented in other publications, we offer here for the first time a perspective on the model of integration of these components into a coherent and consistent system for social human – robot interaction.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Human – Robot Interaction is and will remain a challenging field for Artificial Intelligence.</a>
