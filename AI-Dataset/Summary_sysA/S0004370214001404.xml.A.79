<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, we also consider the problem {a mathematical formula}Ver Σ (S,F) of verifying a given extension, i.e., testing whether a given set S is a Σ -extension of F. This problem typically occurs as a subroutine of a reasoning procedure.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The first conjunction in (1) ensures that the resulting set of arguments is conflict-free, that is, whenever we accept an argument a (i.e., {a mathematical formula}va evaluates to true under a model), all its attackers cannot be selected any further.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Secondly, in [36] the authors provide a smart traversal of the search space such that one can avoid deleting sets from {a mathematical formula}SL, i.e., in each step one can decide whether the current candidate is preferred or not, by only using previously computed preferred labelings (see Algorithm 4).</a>
