<a href="#2" id="2">In this section we provide an algorithm to compute the strategies available to {a mathematical formula}D when v is the current vertex and signal s has been generated by the alarm system.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The algorithm operates in such a way that the sequence of targets corresponding to the expansions made to obtain {a mathematical formula}Qv,tk is a covering route for that set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As a result, Algorithm 4 generates at most {a mathematical formula}|T(s)| covering routes.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this case, the only guarantees that can be provided for each covering route {a mathematical formula}r ∈ CLmax, once the algorithm terminates are:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We focus on the problem of finding the best patrolling strategy given that we know the best signal – response strategy for each vertex v in which {a mathematical formula}D can place.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The algorithm always terminates by the deadline for only {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ {0.75,1.00}.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We report experimental results only for {a mathematical formula} Ε ∈ {0.05,0.25}.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}T(s)=VTSP;</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">By construction of the SRG-v instance, there is a covering route starting from v and visiting all the targets {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T(s), each within its penetration time.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}OPTTSPoracle.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This makes the number of expansions performed by the algorithm {a mathematical formula}O(|T(s)|2).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We conjecture that the problem is {a mathematical formula}FNP-hard.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This is because the number of edges increases as Ε increases and so the number of covering sets increases approaching {a mathematical formula}2|T|.</a>
