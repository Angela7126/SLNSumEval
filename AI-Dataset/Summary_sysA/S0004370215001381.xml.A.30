<a href="#0" id="0">Based on the mapped values, we define meta feature templates in {a mathematical formula}FM for dependency parsing.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The meta feature templates are listed in Table 2, where {a mathematical formula}fb is a base feature of {a mathematical formula}FB, {a mathematical formula}hp refers to the part-of-speech tag of the head and {a mathematical formula}hw refers to the surface word of the head.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The number of the new features is small.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The number of the possible values of {a mathematical formula}Pfb is at most {a mathematical formula}6×N(TB), where {a mathematical formula}N(TB) refers to the number of the base feature templates that is small.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus it is possible to have {a mathematical formula}6×N(TB) for the first type, {a mathematical formula}6×N(TB)×N(POS) for the second type, and {a mathematical formula}6×N(TB)×N(WORD)×N(POS) for the third one, where {a mathematical formula}N(POS) refers to the number of part-of-speech tags and {a mathematical formula}N(WORD) refers to the number of words.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We remove any meta feature related to word form if the word is not one of the Top-K{sup:13} most frequent words in the training data.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This method can further reduce the size of the feature sets.</a>
