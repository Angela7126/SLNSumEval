<a href="#0" id="0">If l is on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}tl, l can obviously be interpreted as true and Lemma 7 is supported.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Otherwise, l and also {a mathematical formula}tl is on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}s9 or {a mathematical formula}s10.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Without any loss of generality, we can interpret l as true also in such a case.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The reason is that another literal sensor representing the complementary literal {a mathematical formula}l â€¾ can never be on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}tl.</a>
