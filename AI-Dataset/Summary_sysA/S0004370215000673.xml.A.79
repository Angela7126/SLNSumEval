<a href="#1" id="1">The correspondence between the proposed minimal model semantics and rational closure suggests the possibility of defining variants of rational closure by varying the three ingredients underlying our approach, namely: (i) the properties of the preference relation <: for instance just preorder, or multi-linear or weakly-connected; (ii) the comparison relation on models: based for instance on the rank of the worlds or on the inclusion between the relations <, or on a special kind of formulas satisfied by a world, as in the logic {a mathematical formula}Pmin[19]; (iii) the choice between fixed or variable interpretations.</a>
