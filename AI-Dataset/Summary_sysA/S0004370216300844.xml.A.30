<a href="#0" id="0">For{a mathematical formula} Μ ∈ {unionCite,fusionCite},{a mathematical formula}Cautious H-Index Manipulation( Μ )is W[1]-hard parameterized by k even if the compatibility graph is a clique.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, the reduction is a parameterized reduction from Independent Set parameterized by ℓ to Cautious H-Index Manipulation parameterized by k since {a mathematical formula}k= ℓ − 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that no article in W cites another article in W and, hence, for any part P in a partition of W, we have {a mathematical formula}unionCite(P)=fusionCite(P).Let us prove the correctness of the reduction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Assume first that {a mathematical formula}(H, ℓ ) is a yes-instance and let S be an independent set of size ℓ in H. Then, merging all articles of S into one article in the Cautious H-Index Manipulation instance is valid since the compatibility graph G is a clique.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In contrast, we now show that {a mathematical formula}H-Index Manipulation( Μ ) is fixed-parameter tractable for any citation measure {a mathematical formula} Μ ∈ {sumCite,unionCite,fusionCite} if the compatibility graph is a clique.</a>
