<a href="#0" id="0">Define {a mathematical formula} ⪯ Μ to be equal to ⪯ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Clearly, in this case {a mathematical formula} ⪯ Μ satisfies (IR1) – (IR4).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, since ⪯ is Horn compliant, so is {a mathematical formula} ⪯ Μ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally for faithfulness, since Μ is inconsistent, by (H*2), {a mathematical formula}[H ⁎ Μ ]= ∅ and therefore {a mathematical formula} ⪯ Μ is trivially faithful with respect to {a mathematical formula}H ⁎ Μ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence the theorem is true when Μ is inconsistent.Assume now that Μ is consistent.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">An immediate consequence of the above result is that, for any consistent Horn formula Μ , there is only one smallest Μ -world (in terms of cardinality); namely the world {a mathematical formula}w Μ as defined in Proposition 5.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consequently, given the definition of the basic ranking ⪯ associated with a Horn belief set H, if {a mathematical formula}H+ Μ ⊢ ⊥ , then {a mathematical formula}min ⁡ ([ Μ ], ⪯ ) is a singleton.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In terms of computational complexity, in [13] it has been shown that Horn satisfiability, as well as the computation of {a mathematical formula}w Μ (if Μ is satisfiable), can be accomplished in linear time.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence the overall time complexity of A1 is also linear.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As discussed above, the “ maximalist ” behaviour of basic Horn revision (as stated in Corollary 2), may not be a desirable feature in some cases.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Therefore in this section we introduce a second Horn revision operator, denoted ⋆ , which we call canonical Horn revision.</a>
