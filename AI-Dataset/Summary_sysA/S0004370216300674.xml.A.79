<a href="#0" id="0">Clearly, MSP is the optimization problem that needs to be solved at each recursive step k of Simon's RTCM procedure — Algorithm 1, line 3, “ find all minimal substructures {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊆ S. ” But MSP is clearly an optimization problem that subsumes CSDP, which we know from Theorem 1 that is NP-Complete by a reduction from ENCD.In fact, an instance of {a mathematical formula}ENCD ′ (as an optimization variant of ENCD) that can be reduced to MSP is as follows: given a bipartite graph {a mathematical formula}G(V1 ∪ V2,E) that bears the complement structural property (cf.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By Definition 1 (no subset of equations has fewer variables than equations), and Definition 2 (number of equations is the same as number of variables), it is easy to see that conditions (a) and (b) above hold iff {a mathematical formula}S is a complete structure.</a>
