<a href="#0" id="0">Abstraction [12]Let Π be a planning task with state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Π =(S,L,T,s0,S ⋆ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An abstraction of Θ is a surjective function {a mathematical formula} Α :S → S Α mapping {a mathematical formula}S to a set of abstract states, {a mathematical formula}S Α .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">After constructing a perimeter around the goal, the search frontier is relaxed into an abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Α 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Abstract searches are used to explore the state space outside the perimeter.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, the abstraction will typically consider states in the perimeter equivalent to other states, so the information is not perfect anymore.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The algorithm initializes the first search in {a mathematical formula} Θ Α 0 with the set of goal states.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, each phase i consists of a backward uniform-cost search in the abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α i initialized with the perimeter frontier of search {a mathematical formula}i − 1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Algorithm 3 can be adapted to compute the ADD representation of the M&S abstraction function (that maps states in S to abstract states in {a mathematical formula}Sn Α ) by assigning to terminal nodes the id of each abstract state instead of their heuristic value.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This perimeter corresponds to a regression search in the original state space, so that no abstraction is used to relax the search yet.</a>
