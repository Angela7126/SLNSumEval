<a href="#0" id="0">Given a CNF formula Φ and a clause C, what is the complexity of deciding whether C is an empowering implicate for Φ ?</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A clause C is called 1-provable with respect to a CNF formula Φ , if {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ ¬C ⊢ 1 ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A clause C is thus 1-provable if it is an implicate of C and the fact that C is an implicate can be proved using unit propagation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let Φ be a CNF formula and let{a mathematical formula}C=l1 ∨ ⋯ ∨ lkbe an implicate of Φ which is not empowering.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let Φ be a nonempty satisfiable CNF formula (i.e.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">it has at least one nonempty clause) and let C be an empowering implicate for Φ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then any implicate{a mathematical formula}C ′ of Φ subsuming C is empowering for Φ (this in particular includes the case when{a mathematical formula}C ′ is prime).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If Φ is not satisfiable, then the proposition of the theorem is trivial.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let us assume that Φ is a satisfiable prime quadratic CNF formula.By Lemma 3.2 it is enough to consider prime implicates as candidates for empowering implicates.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Because Φ is a prime CNF formula, it must contain all the unit prime implicates.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Hence, if any other prime implicate should be added to Φ to make it propagation complete, it must be a quadratic clause which is produced by resolving two other quadratic clauses.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The problem of testing whether a given CNF formula Φ has an empowering implicate is in NP.</a>
