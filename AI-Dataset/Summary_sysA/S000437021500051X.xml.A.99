<a href="#0" id="0">We first retrieve the already moved objects {a mathematical formula}Ocoll that collided the largest number of times with a robot's hand or grasped object when trying to find a geometric instance of a:{a mathematical formula} where nbColl is the function that returns the number of collisions that were detected between the robot's hand and object o, and collisions that were detected between the object grasped by the robot and object o, and {a mathematical formula}Omoved is the set of objects that have been moved by hybrid actions of P. The statistics used for evaluating nbColl are gathered during the generation of target poses (which precedes motion planning) when the preconditions of {a mathematical formula}ai are evaluated.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the present section, we evaluate the effect of propagating geometric constraints on the global search process, i.e., combining the symbolic search space and the geometric search space.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As in the previous experiments, our planning system looks for feasible plans without considering any optimization criterion.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">So, the planning process stops, as soon as the planner finds a feasible plan (see line 6 in Algorithm 1).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Without constraint propagation, the algorithm has to perform exhaustive geometric backtrack search before trying another symbolic action.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Because of the large branching factor, this process is intractable, if the branch contains more than 4 or 5 actions.</a>
