<a href="#0" id="0">In order to evaluate how the deep feature learner could affect future learning of an intelligent agent, in this paper, we integrated this deep feature learning algorithm into SimStudent[11], an agent that learns problem-solving skills by example and by feedback on performance.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The original SimStudent relies on a hand-engineered representation that encodes an expert representation given as prior knowledge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This limits its ability to model novice students.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The extended SimStudent first acquires the representation of the problems using the deep feature learner.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As we have mentioned above, SimStudent is able to acquire production rules in solving complicated problems, but requires a set of operator functions given as prior knowledge.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Some of the operator functions are domain-specific and require expert knowledge to build.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In contrast, the feature learner acquires deep features that are essential for effective learning without requiring prior knowledge engineering.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In order to both reduce the amount of prior knowledge engineering needed for SimStudent and to build a better model of real students, we present a novel approach that integrates the representation learner into SimStudent.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">9 shows a comparison between a production rule acquired by the original SimStudent and the corresponding production rule acquired by the extended SimStudent.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As we can see, the essential change is that the coefficient of the left-hand side (i.e., -3) is included in the perceptual information part in the extended production rule.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore, the operator function sequence no longer needs the domain-specific operator, “ get-coefficient ” .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Then the question becomes how can the algorithm learn to include -3 into the perceptual information part.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To achieve this, we extended the perceptual learning algorithm as described below.</a>
