<a href="#0" id="0">We cover the identification of conflicts during search, conflict analysis & refinement for {a mathematical formula}uC, and clause learning, in this order.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">After any search step, how to navigate directly to the known conflict states?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">And actually, how to directly identify the components of such states, which may be (and is, for one of our {a mathematical formula}uC refinement methods) relevant to the learning?</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We now tackle the refinement step in Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2, for the dead-end detector {a mathematical formula}uC.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given {a mathematical formula}R[s] where all {a mathematical formula}t ∈ R[s] are dead-ends, how to refine {a mathematical formula}uC on {a mathematical formula}R[s] to recognize all these dead-ends?</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let C be any set of atomic conjunctions, let s be a state, and let{a mathematical formula}G ⊆ F.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then{a mathematical formula}uC(s,G)= ∞ if and only if there exists{a mathematical formula}c ∈ Csuch that:</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let C be any set of atomic conjunctions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let{a mathematical formula}S ˆ be a set of dead-end states, and let{a mathematical formula}T ˆ be its neighbors with the{a mathematical formula}uC-recognized neighbors property.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let{a mathematical formula}x ⊆ F.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let C be any set of atomic conjunctions.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let{a mathematical formula}S ˆ be a set of dead-end states, and let{a mathematical formula}T ˆ be its neighbors with the{a mathematical formula}uC-recognized neighbors property.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Compared to the baselines, DFS without learning has basically the same coverage as search with {a mathematical formula}h1, which makes sense as both use the same dead-end detector throughout.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let C be any set of atomic conjunctions.</a>
