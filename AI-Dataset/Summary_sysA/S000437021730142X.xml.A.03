<a href="#0" id="0">An inherent computational problem of conceptual blending is to find a common ground, called generic space, between the two input concepts [27].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These constitutive elements can be organised in a conceptual integration network, i.e., the network of all input spaces, generic spaces and blend spaces together with the selective projections that model a particular blending process.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The blending theory in principle allows for any finite number {a mathematical formula}S ≥ 2 input specifications, but in the implementation we use {a mathematical formula}S=2 for simplicity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Each transition is represented by a fact {a mathematical formula}exec( Γ ,s,t), where t is an iterator and Γ is a transition operator that removes or renames elements in the input specifications (see Sec.</a>
