<a href="#0" id="0">We say a coalition of agents {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ I can perform a task {a mathematical formula}tj if every skill required to perform the task is owned by some agent in the coalition, so {a mathematical formula}S(tj) ⊆ S(C).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We denote the set of tasks a coalition C can perform as {a mathematical formula}T(C).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">CSGA CSG is the coalitional game Γ in a coalitional skill domain, where the players are the agents of the coalitional skill domain, and the characteristic function of a coalition is the value of the tasks that coalition can perform: {a mathematical formula}v Γ (C)=u(T(C)).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For any coalition {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ I we have {a mathematical formula}(v1+v2)(C)=v1(C)+v2(C).</a>
