<a href="#0" id="0">The analysis of the case where bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information is an instance of the case where the auctioneer needs to calculate her expected-benefit-maximizing strategy given the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, as given in Section 3.2, for {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this case, the auctioneer will simply choose the subset {a mathematical formula}Rauc associated with the maximum value according to the first column in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since all elements in the first column, except for {a mathematical formula}( ∅ , ∅ ), decrease equally due to the increase in the value C, the auctioneer will keep on using this strategy for any setting with greater C values until her expected benefit is less than {a mathematical formula}u( ∅ , ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this section we extend the equilibrium analysis to the case of using mixed strategies.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The nature of the mixed-strategy perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium in our model is necessarily such that while the auctioneer randomizes between the different pure strategies the bidders keep using a pure strategy.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is due to the fact that if the auctioneer discloses the value x of X then the dominating strategy for each bidder is to bid her expected private value, as before, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} Similarly, when a value is not disclosed, the dominating strategy for the bidders is to bid their expected individual private value, based on their belief of the strategy used by the auctioneer (and consequently the probability they assign to each value {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X when information is not disclosed).</a>
