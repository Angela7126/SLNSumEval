<a href="#1" id="1">The group betweenness centrality of a set of nodes {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ V is defined as a function {a mathematical formula}cgb:2V → R such that:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Σ st(S) is the number of shortest paths from s to t passing through at least one node in S (if {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S or {a mathematical formula}t ∈ S then {a mathematical formula} Σ st(S)=0).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this subsection we will construct an efficient algorithm for computing the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure for unweighted graphs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Specifically, in such graphs, the number of nodes on the shortest path between s and t is equal to the distance between s and t, denoted by {a mathematical formula}d(s,t).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{sup:12} In other words, we have: {a mathematical formula}| Ψ (p)|=d(s,t).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Using the above equation, we are able to compute a parameterized betweenness centrality for weighted graphs {a mathematical formula}cfg ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Specifically, for a node v, we compute {a mathematical formula}cfg ⁎ (v) by iterating over all other nodes and summing their contributions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">More formally:{a mathematical formula} where the value of the function {a mathematical formula}g Δ ⁎ depends solely on the number of nodes lying on the shortest paths between s and v.</a>
