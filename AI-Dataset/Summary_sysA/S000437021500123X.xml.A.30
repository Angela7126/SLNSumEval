<a href="#0" id="0">To create a plan to find the magazine, Dora must reason about two entities that do not yet exist in its relational map: the magazine and the room that object is in.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This incompleteness in knowledge requires open-world planning â€” that is, planning that takes into account the fact that new entities may become known to the robot during plan execution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given the initial relational map, the planner hypothesizes extensions to it.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To create these extensions, the planner has assumptive actions it can take, each making one or more assumptions about instance knowledge.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The planner selects a sequence of assumptive actions that are likely to be true according to default knowledge, and which enable goal achievement.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The planner does not make task-irrelevant assumptions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the case of Q1 and Q2, this means updating the relational map.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For Q3 and Q4, it means updating the default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, Dora can plan and verify explanations that lead to updating of both instance and default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For example, the search action has the precondition that the robot must be in the room which it plans to search: (= (is-in ?a) ?p) and (= (in-room ?p) ?r).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">But when planning in partially explored environments, we do not yet know to which room a place node belongs.</a>
