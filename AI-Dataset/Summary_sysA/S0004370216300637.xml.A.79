<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}A be a model in which {a mathematical formula} ∀ xPix is true, and {a mathematical formula} ∀ x¬Ab Α x is true for all {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ X, while the extension of the remaining predicates is determined by applying the rules in {a mathematical formula} Σ ↑ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Assume towards contradiction that X is not a minimal exception set for {a mathematical formula}vi, and that {a mathematical formula}X ′ ⊂ X is.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, X is not an acceptable exception set for {a mathematical formula}vj.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this case there is a negative path from {a mathematical formula}vj to itself of which no element is in X.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since this path is a contradicting set relative to {a mathematical formula}vj, it follows that X is not an acceptable exception set for {a mathematical formula}vj.</a>
