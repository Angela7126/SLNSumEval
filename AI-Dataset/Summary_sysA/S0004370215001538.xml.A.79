<a href="#0" id="0">Extending the parallel from the history of general game playing to computer models solving intelligence tests, the composition of an inventory of problems and the proposal of some criteria to compare the different systems is a crucial step.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We hope that our work can be a starting point towards a more systematic and general treatment of computer models solving intelligence tests and towards the development of (more) general intelligent systems passing arbitrary intelligence tests.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Taking this perspective, item difficulty can be either explained completely independent of humans by means of algorithmic information theory or based on the assumed complexity of the cognitive processes and representations necessary to solve a test item.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">He thought that the choice of geometric-analogy problems was suitable because: (i) “ problems of this type require elaborate processing of complex line drawings ” , (ii) “ the form of problems, [ … ] more speculative, [ … ] presents an interesting paradigm of ‘ reasoning by analogy ’ ” , and (iii) “ problems of this type are widely regarded as requiring a considerable degree of intelligence for their solution and in fact are used as a touchstone of intelligence in various intelligence tests ” [10].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When we began our investigation we soon realised that computer models addressing intelligence tests have different purposes and applications: to advance AI by the use of challenging problems (this is the Psychometric AI approach), to use them for the evaluation of AI systems, to better understand intelligence tests and what they measure (including item difficulty), and, finally, to better understand what (human) intelligence is.</a>
