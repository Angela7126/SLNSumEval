<a href="#0" id="0">In that setting, the question is whether an imputation for {a mathematical formula} Π ¯ exists which is stable — formally, this amounts to use {a mathematical formula}{ Π ¯} in place of {a mathematical formula}CS(G) in Equation (1).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To address this problem, actually with {a mathematical formula} Ε <0 (as the case {a mathematical formula} Ε =0 reduces to CS-Core-NonEmptiness), we recall the characterization of Lemma 3.9: the least coalition structure core value of Γ is at most Ε if, and only if, (i){a mathematical formula}|CS-opt( Γ )|=1, and (ii){a mathematical formula} Π ∈ CS-opt( Γ ) implies {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ CS-opt( Γ Π ,- Ε ) and {a mathematical formula}CS-core( Γ Π ,- Ε ) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, we need just to show that (i) and (ii) can be checked in polynomial time over lines.Indeed, by Claim 6.2, the optimal social welfare can be computed in polynomial time, in fact, together with a feasible coalition structure {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ CS-opt( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By iteratively applying the transformation, the problem can be equivalently formulated as the problem of checking whether a pair {a mathematical formula}( Π ′ ,x ′ ), which can be built in polynomial time, belongs to the coalition structure core of the game {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ .</a>
