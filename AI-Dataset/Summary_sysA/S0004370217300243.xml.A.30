<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}t:L → R − , i.e., the time cost of driving through a given path,</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, {a mathematical formula}LS ⁎ represents the optimal path for S, defined as{a mathematical formula} Considering this, a SR problem can be easily translated into a GCCF problem, as each feasible set of riders is indeed a feasible coalition and {a mathematical formula}v( ⋅ ) provides its coalitional value.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence, {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ represents the optimal coalition structure which maximises the social welfare (i.e., minimises the total cost) for the system.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, the computation of the optimal path in Equation (3) is NP-hard [31], which would not be solvable in realistic scenarios.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}Ad(CS)Given a coalition structure CS, {a mathematical formula}Ad(CS) is the set of coalitions in CS that contain at least one driver, i.e., the set of cars.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Formally, {a mathematical formula}Ad(CS)={S ∈ CS|S ∩ D ≠ ∅ }.</a>
