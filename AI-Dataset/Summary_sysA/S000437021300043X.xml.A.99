<a href="#0" id="0">The significance of this perspective is that the satisfiability problem of a given belief formula with respect to the class of belief-function structures is equivalent to that with respect to the class of probability-function structures.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So we can translate the complexity of satisfiability problem with respect to the class of belief-function structures into that of satisfiability problem with respect to the class of probability structures, which follows directly from the well-known result in [18] with respect to the class of Boolean algebras as well as the representation theorem for distributive lattices (Theorem A.2 in Appendix A).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In Section 5, we show that the complexity of deciding whether a belief formula is satisfiable with respect to the class of belief-function structures on distributive lattices (especially on those structures for many non-classical logics) is NP-complete.</a>
