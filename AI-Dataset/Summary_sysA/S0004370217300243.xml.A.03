<a href="#0" id="0">The set of all coalition structures is {a mathematical formula} Π (A).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the other hand, when the size of the coalitions is limited to k members, such an algorithm has polynomial time complexity [39], since the coalitions are {a mathematical formula}O(nk)[29].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}t:L → R − , i.e., the time cost of driving through a given path,</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}Ad(CS)Given a coalition structure CS, {a mathematical formula}Ad(CS) is the set of coalitions in CS that contain at least one driver, i.e., the set of cars.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, we define {a mathematical formula} Θ S= − ∞ if any of the constraints is violated.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Assume that {a mathematical formula}a2 and {a mathematical formula}a3's time constraints satisfy Proposition 3.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}DIV(G,1,k)={{a1},{a2},{a3}}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}DIV(G,2,k)={{a4},{a1,a2},{a1,a3}}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}DIV(G,3,k)={{a1,a4},{a1,a2,a3}}</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}DIV(G,4,k)={{a1,a2,a4},{a1,a3,a4}}</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">On the other hand, we vary the width of the time window {a mathematical formula} Θ i for each agent.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We further investigate the impact of time constraints on the performance of SR-CFSS by varying the {a mathematical formula} Θ i's radius, as discussed in Section 6.2.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To this end, we first compute the optimal solution of a SR problem without time constraints on random instances with {a mathematical formula}n ∈ {30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100} and {a mathematical formula}|D| ∈ {10%,50%,80%}, and we use our algorithm to compute a kernel-stable payoff vector.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Since we consider Constraint 2, {a mathematical formula}ai can be the only driver of any coalition containing both {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}aj.</a>
