<a href="#0" id="0">An operator or action o is classical (or deterministic) if {a mathematical formula}effects(o) contains just one conjunction of literals.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A planning domain {a mathematical formula}D=(L,O) is classical if every operator in O is classical.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A planning problem {a mathematical formula}P=(D,S0,G) is classical if D is classical and there is just one initial state, i.e., {a mathematical formula}S0={s0} for some {a mathematical formula}s0 ∈ S.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this case we will dispense with {a mathematical formula}S0 and write {a mathematical formula}P=(D,s0,G).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">On the other hand, many of the problems have solutions that differ only slightly from the shortest path, and NDP2's performance is “ only ” exponential in the length of that path, and so NDP2's indirect use of FF's heuristic function enabled it to solve some of the planning problems all the way up to size 66, even though MBP could not solve any problems larger than size 21.</a>
