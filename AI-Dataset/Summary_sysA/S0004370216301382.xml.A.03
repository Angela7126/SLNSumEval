<a href="#0" id="0">In this subsection, we conduct extensive experiments of our CCEHC algorithm and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors, i.e., DistUP, Dist and CCLS on all testing benchmarks, i.e., the MSE2014_WPMS_Random, MSE2014_WPMS_Crafted and MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmarks and four real-world application WPMS benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Table 2 presents the comparative results of our CCEHC algorithm and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors DistUP, Dist and CCLS on the MSE2014_WPMS_Random benchmark.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The comparative results of CCEHC and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors DistUP, Dist and CCLS on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and four real-world application WPMS benchmarks are summarized in Table 4.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, the results of VBS present that CCEHC are complementary to WPM-2014 on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and the pedigree benchmark, which indicates that the combination of SLS algorithms and complete algorithms could achieve better performance on solving industrial WPMS instances.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hard clause weighting scheme: The CCEHC algorithm employs a clause weighting scheme that only works for hard clauses to diversify the search, while the CCLS algorithm does not use any clause weighting schemes.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Time to activate the hard clause weighting scheme: The CCEHC algorithm activates the hard clause weighting scheme when there is no HCSCCD variable, while Dist does that when no decreasing variable exists.</a>
