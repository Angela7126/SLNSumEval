<a href="#0" id="0">Theorem 1 gives an analytical solution of {a mathematical formula}x ⁎ in an ideal situation when the values of {a mathematical formula} Λ ⁎ and {a mathematical formula} Η ⁎ are given.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{sup:2} This bisection method can estimate {a mathematical formula} Λ ⁎ in logarithm time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Clearly, by Theorem 2, if {a mathematical formula}s1 ˆ ≤ s1, the estimator {a mathematical formula} Λ ˆ is no less than {a mathematical formula} Λ ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Otherwise, {a mathematical formula}s1 ˆ >s1 means {a mathematical formula} Λ ˆ < Λ ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Together with the monotonicity given in Theorem 2, a bisection approach can be employed to calculate {a mathematical formula} Λ ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">2 and Theorem 4, the difference between the unknown globally optimal solution of Problem (1) and ours is upperbounded by a multiple of the underlying error term {a mathematical formula} ‖ e ⁎ ‖ 2.</a>
