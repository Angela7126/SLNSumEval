<a href="#0" id="0">Our experimental comparison shows that the algorithms perform differently in each case.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The exact algorithms based on the backward induction are significantly better in the offline setting, where they are able to find the optimal strategy very quickly compared to the sampling algorithms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In some cases, our novel algorithm ({a mathematical formula}DO Α Β ) solves the game in less than 2% of the time required by the standard backward induction algorithm.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, the exact algorithms are less competitive in the online setting.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In contrast, the approximative sampling algorithms can perform very well in the online setting and find good strategies to play within a few seconds, however, they are not well-suited for offline solving of games.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When extracting strategies from {a mathematical formula}DO Α Β , we proceed exactly as in the case of {a mathematical formula}BI Α Β : either a double-oracle is initialized and solved for a certain matrix game and we keep the equilibrium strategies from the final restricted game, or the strategy is extracted from the serialized alpha-beta algorithms as before.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We compare the sampling algorithms in the game variants in the order of the presented tables.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The differences in the performance of the sampling algorithms are relatively small between each other.</a>
