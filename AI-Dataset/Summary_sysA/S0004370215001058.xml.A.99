<a href="#0" id="0">In Section 8.4 we will generate approximate ({a mathematical formula} Α , Θ )-solution sets using Definition 7 for the first two problems and show numerically that, with probability greater than or equal to Α , the approach we discussed generates solution sets that satisfy chance constraints in the model with a margin of error Θ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The number of Monte Carlo runs was set to guarantee a margin of error of {a mathematical formula} Θ /10 with a confidence level of 0.9, in such a way as to ensure an approximation error negligible with respect to the chosen Θ . SSLSP instances can be solved to optimality by using a deterministic equivalent mixed integer linear programming model [30].</a>
