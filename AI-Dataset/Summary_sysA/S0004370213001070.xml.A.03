<a href="#0" id="0">To show that the optimal strategy selection problem is NP-hard, we shall design a family of polytree-shaped limids over binary variables such that for each instance {a mathematical formula}z1, … ,zn of the partition problem there is a limid in the family whose size is polynomial in b (the size of the partition problem) and satisfies {a mathematical formula}max Δ E[U| Δ ] ⩾ 0 if and only if {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1nzi Δ i/z=1 for some solution Δ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, {a mathematical formula} ∑ iE[Vi| Δ ]= − ∑ i=1nzi Δ i/z, which equals minus one if and only if the strategy Δ is a yes-solution to the partition problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The next lemma shows that for any partition problem the expected utility of a strategy differs from (5) by at most {a mathematical formula}2 − 9b.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">According to the lemma above, the absolute difference between the expected utility of a strategy Δ and the value of the function f evaluated at the point {a mathematical formula} ∑ izi Δ i/z is less than {a mathematical formula}2 − 9b.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">According to Lemma 1, for any strategy Δ we have that {a mathematical formula}E[U| Δ ]>f( ∑ i=1nzi Δ i/z) − 2 − 9b.</a>
