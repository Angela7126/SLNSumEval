<a href="#0" id="0">Bridge ruleGiven {a mathematical formula}i,i1, … ,in ∈ I, a bridge rule from{a mathematical formula}i1, … ,into i is an expression of the form {a mathematical formula}i1: Φ 1, … ,in: Φ n → i: Φ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A bridge rule can be seen as an axiom spanning between different logical theories (the local knowledge bases); it restricts the set of possible DFOL models to those in which {a mathematical formula}i: Φ is a logical consequence of {a mathematical formula}i1: Φ 1, … ,in: Φ n.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We call {a mathematical formula}i1: Φ 1, … ,in: Φ n the premises of the rule and {a mathematical formula}i: Φ the conclusion.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The distinction between local and global assumptions is necessary to correctly characterise the notion {a mathematical formula} ⊨ BR of DFOL logical consequence where, as we have seen in Proposition 6, the deduction theorem only holds with complete formulas or local assumptions.</a>
