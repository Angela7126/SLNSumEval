<a href="#0" id="0">Consider a global function of the form{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Φ i(v) denotes the share of player i in the global potential function in outcome v. An intuitive and simple version of {a mathematical formula} Φ i(v) was proposed for the simplified version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game in a former paper [8]:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, this is the state with the lowest social welfare out of all PNEs, because in the stable state the utility of a player in state {a mathematical formula}Tl is lower than the utility of a player in state {a mathematical formula}Fl.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, the maximal payoff that player i will be willing to secure for player j is {a mathematical formula}Ci.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, if player i that is currently in state {a mathematical formula}T1, deviates from F to T, then eventually the social welfare will increase.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">4b).Note that the social welfare of the initial outcome is {a mathematical formula}8 ⋅ 2 − 6 ⋅ C; this is due to the fact that each player has at least two neighbors taking the action and there are six players with strategy {a mathematical formula}vi=T.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The social welfare of the outcome yielded by Algorithm 2 is {a mathematical formula}8 ⋅ 2 − 4 ⋅ C, which is higher.</a>
