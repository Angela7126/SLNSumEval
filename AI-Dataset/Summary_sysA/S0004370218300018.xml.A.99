<a href="#0" id="0">As well-known, {a mathematical formula}SROIQ-RL knowledge bases can be expressed in first-order (FO) logic [26], where every axiom {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ L Σ is translated into an equivalent FO sentence {a mathematical formula} ∀ x. Φ Α (x) where x contains all free variables of {a mathematical formula} Φ Α depending on the type of the axiom (see below).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">With the characterization of justified clashing assumptions at hand, we can devise a refutation algorithm for {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ c: Α resp.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}K ⊨ Α that finds a justified CAS-model {a mathematical formula}ICAS of {a mathematical formula}K in which the query does not hold.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As the axiom Α amounts to a universal sentence {a mathematical formula} ∀ x. Φ Α (x) resp.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula} ∀ x. Φ Α (x,c), it is sufficient to consider named models relative to the individual constants in {a mathematical formula}K and fresh (Skolem) constants for the negated query.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, he presented – exploiting a normal form of axioms – a fixed datalog program that gives a universal encoding of the proof systems associated with concrete DL knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K, where {a mathematical formula}K and the instance query are represented by a set of facts.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In turn, the positive literals in {a mathematical formula}Sc, 〈 Α ,e 〉 must be derived via the materialization calculus, and the negative literals via contradiction proofs defined by the test mechanism mentioned at the beginning of Section 5.2 and previously detailed.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the translation of local programs, we also add the defeasibility deduction rules of {a mathematical formula}PD, defining the rules for overriding and defeasible propagation of the global knowledge: in particular, the following rule ovr-subc provides the condition for overriding of atomic inclusion axioms like the one considered in our example:{a mathematical formula} Propagation of defeasible atomic inclusion axioms is defined by the rule prop-subc:{a mathematical formula} In Step 3 of the translation, the final program {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD) results as the union of {a mathematical formula}PG(G) and all the local programs, including {a mathematical formula}PC(cultural_tourist,KtourD).Let us now consider what can be inferred from {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD).</a>
