<a href="#0" id="0">We first prove that M has an equilibrium given {a mathematical formula}KB and {a mathematical formula}I, for any knowledge base configuration {a mathematical formula}KB= 〈 kb1, … ,kbn 〉 for M and input {a mathematical formula}I for M.We prove this by induction on the number of contexts of M, making use of the following simple observation: if M does not have cycles, then there exists some {a mathematical formula}i ∈ {1, … ,n} such that {a mathematical formula}refr(j,i) does not hold for any {a mathematical formula}j ∈ {1, … ,n} and {a mathematical formula}r ∈ BRj, where {a mathematical formula}refr(j,i) holds precisely when r is a bridge rule of context {a mathematical formula}Cj and {a mathematical formula}i:b occurs in the body of r. It is quite easy to see that if this condition is violated then a cycle necessarily exists.Let {a mathematical formula}n=1.</a>
