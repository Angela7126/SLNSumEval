<a href="#0" id="0">Then the cost of a path s with respect to X is defined as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} ℓ e(X) is the amount of flow passing through edge e, defined as{a mathematical formula} A useful property of the choice vector X is that as each player i chooses path s with probability {a mathematical formula} Π i,s=xi,sn, the expected value of each {a mathematical formula}Xi,s is exactly {a mathematical formula}xi,s, which implies that {a mathematical formula}E[Xi]=xi for each i and {a mathematical formula}E[X]=x.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As in [29], we assume that the cost functions satisfy the property that for any {a mathematical formula}y ∈ [0,1] and any {a mathematical formula}e ∈ E, {a mathematical formula}ce(0)=0, {a mathematical formula}ce(1) ≤ 1, {a mathematical formula}ce ′ (y) ≥ A>0 and {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ ce ″ (y) ≤ B, where {a mathematical formula}A,B are positive constants.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:11} By Lemma 4 of [29], for constants {a mathematical formula}a=A and {a mathematical formula}b=B+1 defined accordingly, the cost functions satisfy the condition that{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then we can conclude that their distributions at step t are all the same,{sup:12} which basically can be described by the flow {a mathematical formula}xit of player i, due to the law of large number as the number of agents is huge.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, the settings for the two definitions of the game also match.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this case, each player's algorithm becomes the multiplicative updates algorithm, and according to Proposition 15 we can choose{a mathematical formula} which gives us{a mathematical formula} Although we stated above the convergence bounds in terms of the number of episodes, by incorporating the sizes of the episodes, it follows that the number of steps needed for convergence is at most{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Nevertheless, there are natural cases when such approximate equilibrium is meaningful.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As mentioned in Proposition 13, for classes of cost functions with small B, small {a mathematical formula}Bmn can be obtained to give meaningful Δ -equilibria.</a>
