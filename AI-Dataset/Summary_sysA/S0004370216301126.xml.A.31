<a href="#0" id="0">Proof</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By Theorem 1, any sequence of IR deals must converge to an efficient state, independently from the specific payment scheme in use.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As we are using the Knaster payment scheme, any state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) reached during negotiation will satisfy {a mathematical formula} Π (i)=exi(A) − Ex(A)/n for each agent i.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence, we are bound to converge to a state {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ) with an efficient allocation {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ where {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (i)=exi(A ⁎ ) − Ex(A ⁎ )/n.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is exactly the kind of outcome we would have obtained had we used the Knaster procedure, which we have seen to always be proportional (see Section 3.1).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Proof</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We first show that the following invariant will be true for every state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) and every agent i, provided that agents only negotiate IR deals using the GUPF:{a mathematical formula} Our proof proceeds by induction over the number of deals negotiated.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As we assume that initial equitability payments have been made, claim (2) will certainly be true for the initial state {a mathematical formula}(A0, Π 0).</a>
