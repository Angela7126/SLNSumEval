<a href="#0" id="0">We observe that when we are looking for an Ε bounded solution, we can reuse the old path cost {a mathematical formula}v(s) for an underconsistent state s (selected for expansion), as long as {a mathematical formula}g Π (s)+h(s) ≤ Ε ⋅ (v(s)+h(s)).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This stems from the fact that for an underconsistent state s selected for expansion, {a mathematical formula}v(s)+h(s) is a lower bound on the solution cost through s, as {a mathematical formula}v(s) holds previous shortest path cost (from {a mathematical formula}sstart) and {a mathematical formula}h(s) is a consistent heuristic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the current path to s (from {a mathematical formula}sstart) satisfies the bound on {a mathematical formula}v(s)+h(s), any state {a mathematical formula}s ′ that uses {a mathematical formula}v(s) to compute its {a mathematical formula}g(s ′ ) will never underestimate the actual solution cost by more than the Ε factor.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Now, as no other states have been truncated, {a mathematical formula}g Π (s) is computed by adding the action costs from {a mathematical formula}sstart to s following the bp pointers for each state in the path (check in line 9, Algorithm 2 is never true).Assume that the path is given by {a mathematical formula} Π (s0=sstart, … ,sk=s).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This optimization ensures that D* Lite does need not to alter the Key values of states that already in OPEN (i.e., no reordering required), and also that the Key values of newly generated states maintain the lower bound on the total path cost (note that, {a mathematical formula}h(slast,sstart) ≤ c ⁎ (slast,sstart)).</a>
