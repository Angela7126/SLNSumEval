<a href="#0" id="0">Third, having gone through an ‘ AI Winter ’ , researchers have not only become more adept at divining what techniques and representations are likely to be promising, they have also made substantial inroads into the science of both AI and Robotics — contributions to this special issue clearly showcase this.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">One would expect that this research line leverages the rich AI tradition in knowledge representation and ontologies.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The applicability of a given AI technique, designed to provide a certain cognitive ability, to robotics may depend on its ability to address one or more of the above challenges.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In general, cognitive abilities and robotic challenges can be organized in the matrix shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This Special Issue is essentially the first of many steps that we believe are needed to get AI and Robotics to be more aligned and co-mingled with ideas, techniques and methods, formal and otherwise.</a>
