<a href="#0" id="0">Given a state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S, time t and {a mathematical formula}k ≥ 1, we define the {a mathematical formula}Value function capturing the expected cumulative future reward by using k sequential pieces of advice, starting at state s at time t. That is, given that the task had terminated (i.e., {a mathematical formula}t ∉ T), no future reward is possible.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that the SAR task is remarkably different from the warehouse operation task in several aspects: (1) SAR task's termination time is usually unknown during task execution; (2) Unlike the fully stochastic process in which orders arrive at the warehouse system, the target objects in SAR are revealed by the robots themselves.</a>
