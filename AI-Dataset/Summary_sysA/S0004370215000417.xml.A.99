<a href="#0" id="0">The convex hull of the problem with 3 nodes, {a mathematical formula}P3, was found using the lrs{sup:2} algorithm.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this case, it transpires that {a mathematical formula}P3 consists of 17 facets; 9 lower bounds on the variables' values, the 3 limits on each node having one parent set, 4 cluster constraints, and a single extra constraint:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The constraints based on the convex hull of the 4 node BN polytope can be added to the problem initially or used as cutting planes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the case where they are used as cutting planes, they can be searched for whenever a solution needs separating or only when no efficacious cluster constraints can be found.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As before, cycle finding with a maximum length of 6, followed by the sub-IP if necessary is used with the convex hull constraints added as cutting planes only when efficacious cluster cuts are not found.</a>
