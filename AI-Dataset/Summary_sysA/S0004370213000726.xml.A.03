<a href="#0" id="0">First let us recall that a formula Φ is unit refutation complete if for every implicate C of Φ we have that {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ ¬C ⊢ 1 ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We shall show that C is an implicate of Φ if and only if {a mathematical formula}C ′ is an empowering implicate of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ with {a mathematical formula}x¯ as the empowered literal.Let C be an implicate of Φ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">C is clearly an implicate of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ , and hence also {a mathematical formula}C ′ is an implicate of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From Theorem 4.2 it follows that there is an empowering 1-provable implicate {a mathematical formula}C Φ of Φ with an empowered literal ℓ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this way we shall obtain a resolution proof of a clause {a mathematical formula}C ′ ⊆ C Φ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note also that formula {a mathematical formula} Φ n is anti-Horn (i.e.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In case W does not contain a perfect matching {a mathematical formula} Φ W is not unit refutation complete and thus it is not propagation complete as well.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The CNF formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ =A1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ Aq has no unit clauses and thus unit propagation will not derive anything from it.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let us consider implicate {a mathematical formula}H1 from Example 5.3 and let us show how it can be derived by resolutions from formula {a mathematical formula} Φ W.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus {a mathematical formula}H1 is indeed an empowering implicate of {a mathematical formula} Φ W.</a>
