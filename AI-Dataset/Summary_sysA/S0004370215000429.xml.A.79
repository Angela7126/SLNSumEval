<a href="#0" id="0">Roth's theorem [20], one of the main results in the area, states that for the hypergraph formed by the arithmetic progressions in {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,n}, that is {a mathematical formula}Hn=(Un,Sn), where {a mathematical formula}Un={1,2, … ,n} and elements of {a mathematical formula}Sn being of the form {a mathematical formula}(d ⋅ i+c) for arbitrary {a mathematical formula}d,c, the discrepancy grows at least as {a mathematical formula}120n1/4.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We prove the surprising result that {a mathematical formula}127645, the length of the longest completely multiplicative sequence of discrepancy 3, is also the maximal length of a multiplicative sequence of discrepancy 3, which is not the case for {a mathematical formula}C=1 and {a mathematical formula}C=2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It can be checked in a similar way that the other possibility of {a mathematical formula}x1 being − 1 also leads to a contradiction.The first eleven elements of the sequence (3) form a discrepancy 1 sequence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Reasoning similar to the one above shows that there exists a unique longest completely multiplicative ±1 sequence of discrepancy 1 which has nine elements:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, under the conditions of the proposition, {a mathematical formula}| ∑ i=1jai| ≤ C − 1, and the sequence can be extended arbitrarily.</a>
