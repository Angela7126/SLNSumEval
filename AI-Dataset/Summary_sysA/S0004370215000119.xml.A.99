<a href="#0" id="0">The weak Ε -core is defined for a particular coalition structure that may or may not be not optimal, relaxes only the non-blocking condition with parameter Ε , and efficiently distributes the rewards that the coalition structure earns.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the other hand, the weak Ε -core{sup:+} does not specify a particular coalition structure beforehand.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It then relaxes the efficiency condition of the weak Ε -core (for the optimal coalition structure), in addition to the non-blocking condition, and efficiently distributes the reward that the dual solution provides.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, the sum of the elements in the payoff vector, i.e., the sum of the rewards distributed to agents, can be less than the value of the optimal coalition structure, but the difference must be at most {a mathematical formula} Ε ⋅ n, where n is the number of agents.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The weak Ε -core for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ requires that the payoff vector be efficient.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To find an efficient payoff vector, we need to know the exact value of {a mathematical formula}V(CS ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since finding its exact value is NP-hard, it is natural to utilize an approximate, semi-optimal solution against the weak Ε -core for {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
