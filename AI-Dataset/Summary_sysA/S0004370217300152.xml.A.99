<a href="#0" id="0">Note that we necessarily have {a mathematical formula}I(Dji) ∩ A+= ∅ since {a mathematical formula}Dji ∈ A+ and {a mathematical formula}A+ is an embedded sequence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, we have {a mathematical formula}I(Dji) ⊆ A − which means that {a mathematical formula} Ω A<0 for all {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I(Dji); hence, the objective function of problem (34) increases as variable {a mathematical formula}vA decreases.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We want to prove that there exists an optimal solution of problem (34) such that {a mathematical formula}vA ≤ max ⁡ {lA,u} for all {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I(Dji).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I(Dji).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assume first that there exists no set {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ A(x,y) such that {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊂ A.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In that case, Equations (18), (19), (20), (21), (22) do not include any constraint of type {a mathematical formula}vA ′ ≤ vA.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, since the objective function increases as variable {a mathematical formula}vA decreases, we know that there exists an optimal solution such that {a mathematical formula}vA=lA ≤ max ⁡ {lA,uA}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Assume now that there exists {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ A(x,y) such that {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊂ A.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">First, we want to prove that imposing {a mathematical formula}vA ≤ max ⁡ {lA,u} does not impact on variable {a mathematical formula}vA ′ .</a>
