<a href="#0" id="0">The definition does not exactly define a probability distribution as it contains imprecise knowledge, but we can define a probability distribution consistent with the definition for those two random variables by the following assignments:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} From this one can compute the probability of for instance {a mathematical formula}P(DM=true):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This has to be done in such a way that the probability measure P of the original probability space assigns a probability to each event concerning the random variable {a mathematical formula}Vi as well.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula} Ω V is the sample space of the random variables V defined as the Cartesian product of the random variables' ranges:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}AV is an event space representing events concerning the random variables V;</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assume the first two random variables in the sample space have as range the set {a mathematical formula}{sun,rain} and {a mathematical formula}C1={(0.2,{sun,rain}),(0.8,{sun})}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Definitions have the form:{a mathematical formula} where each {a mathematical formula}Vi is a random variable label, {a mathematical formula}Xi is a parameter, {a mathematical formula}pi is a probability and {a mathematical formula} Φ i is a constraint.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The {a mathematical formula} Φ i are constraint definitions using the {a mathematical formula}Vi as placeholder for the random variables.</a>
