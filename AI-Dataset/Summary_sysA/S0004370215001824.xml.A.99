<a href="#0" id="0">The method we apply to obtain these solvers is a portfolio tuning approach ISAC++ which generalizes both tuning of individual solvers as well as combining multiple solvers into one solver portfolio.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a side-effect of our work on MaxSAT, we found a way to improve instance-specific algorithm configuration (ISAC) [28] by combining the original methodology with one of the latest and most efficient algorithm portfolio builders to date.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In fact, when analyzing MaxSAT Evaluation results in greater detail, we find that our method generated parameterizations that no other solver could solve before, within the competition settings.</a>
