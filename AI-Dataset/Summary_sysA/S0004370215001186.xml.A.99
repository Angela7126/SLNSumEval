<a href="#0" id="0">This simplicity does not come by chance, rather, it is necessary and desired by the researchers: the problems to be approached are themselves so complex that whichever factors of complexity can be reduced (or at least postponed), the reduction is always welcome.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So, it is common practice that geographical space is reduced to a two-dimensional grid, and all social relations between agents are condensed into one more or less structured abstract relation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">10 shows the results for configurations with a number of networks ≥ 3 (since less networks lead to much worse results in terms of convergence speed).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These plots reveal two types of situations: the typical runs, in which the number of encounters doesn't vary much, and some “ outlier runs, ” which present some interesting dynamics, as we will see later on.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">20 shows that for 2 networks the results in terms of number of encounters for the context switching approximate those for context permeability.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It is still important that we get comparable results because we are introducing a temporal component that was never explored before in these types of opinion dynamics models: the fact that the agents can become active in different networks at different points in time.</a>
