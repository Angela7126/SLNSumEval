<a href="#0" id="0">We then use an unsupervised method by which these general appliance models can be tuned to the specific appliance instances in a previously unseen household using only aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We provide a method by which the general appliance models can be tuned to the appliances within a specific household using only aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In Section 3 we describe how these general models can be tuned to specific appliance instances using only aggregate data from the test house.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We introduce the notation:{a mathematical formula} to represent the parameters of the general model of an appliance type as defined in the following paragraphs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">More formally, this tuning process directly corresponds to learning the parameters {a mathematical formula} Θ (n) for an appliance instance n in a household, given the appliance type's general model Θ and the household's aggregate data x.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, this process effectively identifies windows of aggregate data during which only an appliance matching its general model changes state.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It then fits distributions to the HMM parameters of each appliance instance to build a general model for each appliance type.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also developed a method by which general appliance models can be tuned to the specific appliance instances in a household given only aggregate data as would be collected by a smart meter.</a>
