<a href="#0" id="0">One track for Sequential Portfolio Solvers: A portfolio solver is a solver that combines different (sequential) SAT algorithms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It may have, e.g., run multiple solvers in a time-slicing manner on a given SAT instance, or selected one solver out of a set of given ones (e.g., determined by a machine-learning approach based on some metric) to tackle the problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This section provides the solver rankings of SAT Challenge 2012, highlighting the best-performing solvers that were awarded, as well as a discussion of the detailed results of each track.</a>
