<a href="#1" id="1">Given an MCS M, an inconsistency explanation of M is a pair {a mathematical formula}(E1,E2) of sets {a mathematical formula}E1,E2 ⊆ br(M) of bridge rules, such that for all {a mathematical formula}(R1,R2) where {a mathematical formula}E1 ⊆ R1 ⊆ br(M) and {a mathematical formula}R2 ⊆ br(M) ∖ E2, it holds that {a mathematical formula}M[R1 ∪ cf(R2)] ⊨ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By {a mathematical formula}E±(M) we denote the set of all inconsistency explanations of M, and by {a mathematical formula}Em±(M) the set of all pointwise subset-minimal ones.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For a pair {a mathematical formula}R=(R1,R2) of sets of bridge rules compatible with M and a set U of contexts we say that R is U-headed iff {a mathematical formula}r ∈ (R1 ∪ R2) implies {a mathematical formula}Ch(r) ∈ U.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">For every {a mathematical formula}tr ∈ TR14(M) it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ tr since {a mathematical formula}I ′ consistently encodes S.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For every {a mathematical formula}tr ∈ TR25(M) ∪ ⋯ ∪ TR27(M) it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ tr since {a mathematical formula}I ′ is conflict-free and {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊭ BHEX(tr).</a>
