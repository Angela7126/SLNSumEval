<a href="#0" id="0">Given {a mathematical formula}s ∈ SA, the transition function {a mathematical formula}s ′ = Ξ (s,A) is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} We say that A is executable if {a mathematical formula}SA ≠ ∅ or, equivalently, if{a mathematical formula} Sets of actions that are not executable do not play any role in our analysis as they will never appear in executable plans (see below for the exact definition).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We can estimate this term with the product {a mathematical formula} Ω ⋅ |C| where Ω is the maximum number of formulas in any schema that shares the same relation and {a mathematical formula}|C| is the cardinality of the template's component set {a mathematical formula}C. We deduce that all safety checks for individual schemas (both the instantaneous and the durative ones) have a computational complexity of the order of {a mathematical formula}M ⋅ |A| ⋅ Ω ⋅ |C|, where M is the maximum number of formulas appearing in any schema and {a mathematical formula}|A| is the total number of schemas.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consequently, this is the computational complexity of Corollary 74, Corollary 98 that only involve safety checks.</a>
