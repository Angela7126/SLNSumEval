<a href="#0" id="0">Given an algorithm {a mathematical formula}A with configuration space Θ and a distribution of instances with feature space {a mathematical formula}F, an EPM is a stochastic process {a mathematical formula}f:I ↦ Δ (R) that defines a probability distribution over performance measures for each combination of a parameter configuration {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ Θ of {a mathematical formula}A and a problem instance with features {a mathematical formula}z ∈ F.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To construct an EPM for an algorithm {a mathematical formula}A with configuration space Θ on an instance set Π , we run {a mathematical formula}A on various combinations of configurations {a mathematical formula} Θ i ∈ Θ and instances {a mathematical formula} Π i ∈ Π , and record the resulting performance values {a mathematical formula}yi.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We denote the subset of training data points in region {a mathematical formula}Rm as {a mathematical formula}Dm.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To construct a regression tree, we use the following standard recursive procedure, which starts at the root of the tree with all available training data points {a mathematical formula}D={(x1,y1), … ,(xn,yn)}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The hyperparameter optimization based on a data points takes time {a mathematical formula}O(h ⋅ a3).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We ran each of these configurations on all of the P problem instances in each of our instance sets (with P ranging from 604 to 2000), generating runtime data that can be thought of as a {a mathematical formula}M×P matrix.</a>
