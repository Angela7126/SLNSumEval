<a href="#0" id="0">Consider the {a mathematical formula}M-based residual set given in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A diagnosis model defined with these residuals is diagnosable when both fault signatures and residual orderings are used (without orderings, faults {a mathematical formula}Re1+, {a mathematical formula}Re2+, and {a mathematical formula}Re3+ have all the same signatures and cannot be distinguished from one another).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that the definition of local diagnosability for a diagnosis submodel is equivalent to the definition of diagnosability for a diagnosis model (Definition 16).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For a set of diagnosis submodels, local diagnosability is not a strong enough condition to ensure global correctness.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The problem is that for two different diagnosis submodels, {a mathematical formula}Si and {a mathematical formula}Sj, there may be some faults {a mathematical formula}fi ∈ Fi and {a mathematical formula}fj ∈ Fj, such that both {a mathematical formula}fi and {a mathematical formula}fj produce the same effects on {a mathematical formula}Ri.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">That is, a diagnosis submodel {a mathematical formula}Si is globally diagnosable if all the faults {a mathematical formula}Fi are distinguishable from every other fault in F, i.e., all other faults in S, using only the residuals in {a mathematical formula}Ri.</a>
