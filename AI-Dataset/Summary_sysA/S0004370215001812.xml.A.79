<a href="#0" id="0">Since checking the non-emptiness of the core (when all coalitions are feasible ones) is in {a mathematical formula}co-NP[44], the proof basically reduces to show that the value {a mathematical formula}SWopt( Γ ), whose knowledge is required to define the payoff associated with the grand-coalition in {a mathematical formula} Γ ˜ Δ , can be computed in polynomial time by exploiting an NP oracle.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, the proof of the membership of CS-Core-Membership in {a mathematical formula}co-NP over the class {a mathematical formula}CK(R) (and, hence, over {a mathematical formula}CKsa(R)) is a simple adaptation of the result derived in the setting where all coalitions are allowed to form [9] — see the proof of Theorem 4.1.Then, consider the remaining results to be shown on the class {a mathematical formula}CKsa(R).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, we need just to show that (i) and (ii) can be checked in polynomial time over lines.Indeed, by Claim 6.2, the optimal social welfare can be computed in polynomial time, in fact, together with a feasible coalition structure {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ CS-opt( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Assume that{a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ is a coalition structure in{a mathematical formula}CS-opt( Γ |i).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, there is a coalition structure Π over G such that{a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ = Π |i.</a>
