<a href="#0" id="0">The exact algorithms based on the backward induction are significantly better in the offline setting, where they are able to find the optimal strategy very quickly compared to the sampling algorithms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In some cases, our novel algorithm ({a mathematical formula}DO Α Β ) solves the game in less than 2% of the time required by the standard backward induction algorithm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the exact algorithms are less competitive in the online setting.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast, the approximative sampling algorithms can perform very well in the online setting and find good strategies to play within a few seconds, however, they are not well-suited for offline solving of games.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We compare all of the approximative sampling algorithms and {a mathematical formula}DO Α Β as a representative of backward induction algorithms, because it was clearly the fastest algorithm in all of the considered games.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the game with stochastic point card sequence, OOS, UCT and RM make approximately {a mathematical formula}10×103 iterations in the 1 second time limit in the root of the game.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Exp3 is slightly slower with {a mathematical formula}8×103 iterations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The best algorithm in this game variant is RM, which wins against all other sampling algorithms and wins most often against {a mathematical formula}DO Α Β and Exp3.</a>
