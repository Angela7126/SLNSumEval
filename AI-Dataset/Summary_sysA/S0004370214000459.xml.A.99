<a href="#2" id="2">In this section, given a family of monotone Boolean functions {a mathematical formula}fn in NP, we first encode them — via the Tseitin transformation [59] — by means of polynomial-size CNFs, which are used to construct a sequence of OWL 2 QL-ontologies {a mathematical formula} Σ fn and Boolean CQs {a mathematical formula}qfn such that{a mathematical formula} where the database instance {a mathematical formula}D Α is determined by Α .</a>
