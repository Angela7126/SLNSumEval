<a href="#1" id="1">In this study, we assume that the agent can only provide one piece of advice at a time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The operator is not obligated to accept the agent's advice, namely, she does not have to perform the suggested actions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the warehouse operation task, using a subject group of Computer Science students, the results show that the 2-MYAO heuristic, deployed by the W-AID2 agent, significantly outperforms the 1-MYAO heuristic deployed by the W-AID1 agent, which in turn significantly enhanced human operator's performance compared to the baseline condition of no advising agent.</a>
