<a href="#0" id="0">If Γ is taken as a small number, for example {a mathematical formula} Γ =0.05, applying Dempster ʼ s rule to aggregate the above two discounted BDs (22) and (23) will lead to the following result:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This result makes sense but is not precise, because the aggregated result of the two pieces of evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 with no ignorance at all still includes a belief degree of 0.0256 allocated to the frame of discernment showing a degree of global ignorance, even though the degree 0.0256 is rather small.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is easy to show that for any {a mathematical formula} Γ >0 the result generated by combining (22) and (23) using Dempster ʼ s rule will always lead to similar imprecise results in the sense that the combined degree of belief in {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C} will always be positive.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As discussed before, the PCR5 rule is not a probabilistic reasoning process, so the result it generates is not a probability, nothing to say that the specificity of each piece of evidence has already been changed even before the PCR5 rule is applied.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As such, there is a question as to how to interpret what the results generated by PCR5 actually mean.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By looking at the final result shown in the last row of Table 4, one obvious concern is that a large portion of the final result is generated as global ignorance with {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5({A,B,C})=0.3506, as shown in the last row and last column of Table 4.</a>
