<a href="#0" id="0">Third, having gone through an ‘ AI Winter ’ , researchers have not only become more adept at divining what techniques and representations are likely to be promising, they have also made substantial inroads into the science of both AI and Robotics — contributions to this special issue clearly showcase this.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This Special Issue is based on an open call to both the AI and Robotics communities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:6} The 18 contributions to this special issue illustrate how AI methods and techniques addressing a given cognitive ability can be extended to address some of our four robotic challenges.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One approach that has been suggested is to define a list of problem statements for integrated AI and Robotics [39].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This Special Issue is essentially the first of many steps that we believe are needed to get AI and Robotics to be more aligned and co-mingled with ideas, techniques and methods, formal and otherwise.</a>
