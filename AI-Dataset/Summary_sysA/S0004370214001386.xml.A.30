<a href="#0" id="0">Recall that the state space spanned by A* in MAPF is exponential in k (the number of agents).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By contrast, in a single-agent pathfinding problem, {a mathematical formula}k=1, and the state space is only linear in the graph size.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">CBS solves MAPF by decomposing it into a large number of constrained single-agent pathfinding problems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Each of these problems can be solved in time proportional to the size of the map and length of the solution, but there may be an exponential number of such single-agent problems.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A constraint is a tuple {a mathematical formula}(ai,v,t) where agent {a mathematical formula}ai is prohibited from occupying vertex v at time step t. During the course of the algorithm, agents will be associated with constraints.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A consistent path for agent {a mathematical formula}ai is a path that satisfies all its constraints.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Likewise, a consistent solution is a solution that is made up from paths, such that the path for any agent {a mathematical formula}ai is consistent with the constraints of {a mathematical formula}ai.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A conflict is a tuple {a mathematical formula}(ai,aj,v,t) where agent {a mathematical formula}ai and agent {a mathematical formula}aj occupy vertex v at time point t. A solution (of k paths) is valid if all its paths have no conflicts.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A consistent solution can be invalid if, despite the fact that the individual paths are consistent with the constraints associated with their agents, these paths still have conflicts.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Node N in the CT is a goal node when {a mathematical formula}N.solution is valid, i.e., the set of paths for all agents has no conflicts.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">MA-CBS serves as a bridge between CBS and other optimal MAPF solvers, such as A*, {a mathematical formula}A*+OD[45] and EPEA* [15].</a>
