<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, each resulting portfolio has been evaluated over the whole collection of planning tasks defined in the IPC 2011 (training set).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The results of this analysis are shown in Table 2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From the table, it results that the same performance (measured in coverage and time) is achieved for all the sequential portfolios derived using all sets of training problems but the first one (which consists just of those problems that were solved by at most one planner).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence, since the number of variables depends on the number of solvers and the 3S MIP task which considers 52 candidate solvers was solved quickly, we hypothesize that the number of candidate time values t (where solvers solve an instance) in our training data set is too small and in general, this value is much higher.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, we have performed an additional experiment with the aim of analyzing the correlation between the number of candidate time values t for each candidate solver and the time required to solve the MIP task.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This additional experiment consists of generating models using the formulation proposed by 3S and the input data defined in the design of MIPSat but considering more candidate time values t (in the discrete range {a mathematical formula}[1,5000]) for each candidate solver.</a>
