<a href="#0" id="0">We prove that for a non-PC CNF formula with s occurrences of literals there always exists a resolution proof of length {a mathematical formula}O(s) of some empowering implicate.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the other hand, we construct examples of CNF formulas where a resolution proof of length {a mathematical formula} Ω (s) is needed for any empowering implicate, which means that {a mathematical formula} Θ (s) is an asymptotically tight bound for this problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The following proposition shows that not only can we find a 1-provable and empowering implicate as in Theorem 4.2 but we can also derive some empowering implicate by a resolution derivation of linear length with respect to the number of literals occurring in given formula.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the first phase we take all unit clauses from {a mathematical formula}¬C Φ and perform unit resolutions only over the variables from {a mathematical formula}C Φ .In the second phase we continue with refutation proof without using unit clauses from {a mathematical formula}¬C Φ and we do not resolve over variables from {a mathematical formula}C Φ at all.Let us now assume that</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In [19] (and in many papers and books that followed) it was shown that pigeon hole principle formulas on {a mathematical formula}n(n+1) variables and {a mathematical formula}O(n3) clauses ({a mathematical formula}PHPn) have minimal resolution refutation of size {a mathematical formula}cn for some {a mathematical formula}c>0.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The lower bound on the length of a resolution refutation of a {a mathematical formula}PHPn formula is only superpolynomial with respect to the length of the formula.</a>
