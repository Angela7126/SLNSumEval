<a href="#1" id="1">The former looks at fixed points in the cell space and measures changes of those points, while the latter treats an MRS as a system of particles, and studies the motion for each particle.Distributed Planning:It is possible to fulfill the Flow operation by parallel execution of locomotion paths planned per each individual module: for instance, the PacMan algorithm by Butler and Rus [24] can be utilized for generating surface-moving systems, and is applicable to unit-compressible systems like the ‘ Crystalline ’ module, in which paths of modules are planned in parallel using the depth-first search strategy and path conflicts are resolved in the actuation phase to let modules flow among obstacles or even climb up them (also see the Gradient-based solution method in Section 2.2.2 for more details on PacMan).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Fitch and Butler [48] employed distributed dynamic programming for planning an individual locomotion path for each module, where modules use local constant-time search and a module-locking scheme in order to ensure physical integrity of the robot, while following their paths toward the goal of locomotion which has been specified by a simple bounding box.Hierarchical Planning:Flow can be considered as a two-level planning problem: at the higher level gross locomotion of the modular robot's body is planned, and at the lower level detailed local movements of modules, coordination of their actions and conflict resolution issues are addressed.</a>
