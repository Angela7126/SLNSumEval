<a href="#0" id="0">More specifically, we present a linear time preprocessing algorithm that reduces an AtMost-NValue constraint C with k holes to a consistency-equivalent AtMost-NValue constraint {a mathematical formula}C ′ of size polynomial in k. In fact, {a mathematical formula}C ′ has at most {a mathematical formula}O(k2) variables and {a mathematical formula}O(k2) domain values.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using standard techniques in the analysis of exponential time algorithms (see, e.g., [33, Chapter 2] and [35, Lemma 2.3]), it suffices to find a value {a mathematical formula}c>1 for the base of the exponential function bounding the running time, that we will minimize, such that{a mathematical formula} or, equivalently, such that{a mathematical formula} It now suffices to find the unique positive real root of {a mathematical formula}x2 − x − 1, which is {a mathematical formula} Φ =1+52<1.6181, to determine the optimal value of c for this analysis.Since the size of the search tree is {a mathematical formula}O( Φ k) and the number of operations executed at each node of the search tree is {a mathematical formula}O(k2), the running time of the branching algorithm can be upper bounded by {a mathematical formula}O( Φ kk2).</a>
