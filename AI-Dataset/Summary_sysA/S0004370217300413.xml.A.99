<a href="#0" id="0">If we apply game-theoretic analysis to such systems, then the main questions to be answered about such systems are not just “ what computations might the system produce? ” , but rather, “ what computations might the system produce if the constituent programs act rationally? ” If we interpret acting rationally to mean choosing strategies (for resolving non-determinism) that are in Nash equilibrium, then this question amounts to asking “ which of the possible computations of the system will be produced in equilibrium? ” Further, if we use temporal logic as the language for expressing properties of our multi-agent and concurrent system (as is standard in the computer aided verification community [20]), then we can also interpret this question as “ which temporal logic formulae are satisfied by computations arising from the selection of strategies in equilibrium? ” We refer to this general problem as equilibrium checking[75].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">At this point, it is useful to remind ourselves that one of the reasons for using srml specifications is that they allow a succinct representation of models that capture the possible (infinite) computations of a distributed, concurrent, and multi-agent (computer) system.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For technical reasons, however, in some cases it is useful to explicitly refer to the Kripke structure – i.e., transition system – that is induced by an arena {a mathematical formula}A=(N, Φ ,m1, … ,mn); such a structure we denote by {a mathematical formula}KA, which may in general be exponential in the size of A.</a>
