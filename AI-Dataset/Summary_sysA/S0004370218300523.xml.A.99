<a href="#0" id="0">Let K be an inconsistent knowledge base and{a mathematical formula}GKthe MIS-graph of K. Then a subset R of K is a minimal correction subset of K if and only if R is a minimal Y-dominating set of{a mathematical formula}GK.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let K be a knowledge base with a soft constraint {a mathematical formula}C. Then the degree of inconsistency of K in the presence of {a mathematical formula}C, denoted {a mathematical formula}Idr(K|C), is defined as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Essentially, {a mathematical formula}Idr(K|C) is the minimal number of formulas that have to be removed from K to break all the minimal inconsistent subsets of K in the presence of constraint {a mathematical formula}C.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let K be a knowledge base with a hard constraint {a mathematical formula}H=(P,Q) and 품 a formula of K. Then the degree of responsibility of 품 for the inconsistency of K in the presence of {a mathematical formula}H, denoted {a mathematical formula}dr(K, 품 |H), is defined as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first item of this proposition shows that only formulas involved in a minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|Q[C]-dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK|H may be considered as causes of the inconsistency in a knowledge base in the presence of a mixed constraint {a mathematical formula}(H,C).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This accords with that only formulas involved in minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|Q[C]-dominating sets of {a mathematical formula}GK|H have to bear nonzero responsibilities for the inconsistency of a knowledge base with the constraint in the context of the measure {a mathematical formula}dr(K, 품 |H,C).</a>
