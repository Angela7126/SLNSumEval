<a href="#0" id="0">By {a mathematical formula}At( Π ) we denote the set of atoms occurring in a program Π .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">there is an input answer set A of {a mathematical formula} Π D w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We are given that X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π A.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We are given that X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π A.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consequently, X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π A and therefore a constraint answer set of Π .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus any set X of atoms is an answer set of Π iff it is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}X+is an answer set of Π ,</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By Proposition 11, it follows that X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π (Q) ′ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">From Proposition 5, it follows that {a mathematical formula}M+ is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π Ξ .</a>
