<a href="#0" id="0">The primary contribution of this article is a new model called SHARP (Stochastic Human behavior model with AttRactiveness and Probability weighting) that mitigates these three limitations: (i) Modeling the adversary's adaptive decision making process, SHARP reasons based on success or failure of the adversary's past actions on exposed portions of the attack surface; (ii) Addressing limited exposure to significant portions of the attack surface in initial rounds, SHARP reasons about similarity between exposed and unexposed areas of the attack surface, and also incorporates a discounting parameter to mitigate adversary's lack of exposure to enough of the attack surface; (iii) Addressing shortcomings of existing models in learning the adversaries' weighting of probabilities, we incorporate a two parameter probability weighting function in existing human behavior models.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While researchers often use imputation and sampling techniques to fill missing data due to participant attrition [78], [36], [23], for our repeated measures study of comparing human behavior models this may result in extremely biased estimates of the modeling parameters due to the influence of the retained participants' game plays and therefore may generate biased defender strategies.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Due to the differences in animal densities, if we start from a uniform mixed strategy, it would leave many of the targets of high animal density to be attacked in round 1 (as evidenced from other human subject experiments conducted in the past [66]) and that would result in a defender utility which is much lower than the cumulative utility for any of our models over five rounds (see Section 12 for details).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given that this strategy performs worse in one round than the cumulative average expected defender utility of all the other models, it demonstrates the point that the performance of SUQR without probability weighting is worse than any of the other models that include probability weighting.Notice that the reason this SUQR pure strategy performs so poorly is that it leaves 16 out of 25 targets completely exposed, and among these targets are ones with animal densities 4 and 5.</a>
