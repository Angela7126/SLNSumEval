<a href="#1" id="1">From the actions of line 14 in Algorithm 2 this implies that there exists an admissible set {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊃ S s.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A further, significant difference is that CAYCred selects an argument to be PRO arbitrarily while Algorithm 3 uses a heuristic rule to choose which BLANK argument to expand the search structure.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">So, the expected running time is improved: empirical confirmation being provided by the experiments reported in Section 6.4.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As to the UNDEC label, the objective is to discriminate, and then to avoid, those arguments that previously failed to be in an admissible set with the current PRO arguments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To accomplish this let us first define the set of critical total value orders, denoted by {a mathematical formula}U ′ , which is basically a subset of the set of all specific audiences {a mathematical formula}U.</a>
