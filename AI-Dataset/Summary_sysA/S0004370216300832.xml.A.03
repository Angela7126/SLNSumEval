<a href="#0" id="0">Local search algorithms for weighted MaxSAT can be used to solve PMS, as PMS can be encoded into weighted MaxSAT, by setting the weight of each soft clause as 1 and that of each hard clause as the number of soft clauses plus 1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although many local search techniques for SAT are also effective for solving MaxSAT, local search algorithms for PMS do not benefit that much from the techniques for SAT, mainly due to the fact that it contains both hard and soft clauses.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on these ideas, we develop two local search algorithms for PMS called Dist and DistUP, the latter of which is an improved version of the former for industrial PMS instances.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We present in detail three new local search ideas for PMS in Section 3, and present the Dist algorithm in Section 4.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Previous local search algorithms for PMS also utilize the {a mathematical formula}score property to pick variables.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Previous local search algorithms for PMS utilize the score property, which can be seen as a weighted sum of hard score and soft score in the form of {a mathematical formula}A â‹… hscore(x)+sscore(x), where A is a positive integer number.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Results on Industrial PMS Benchmark:Table 3 summarizes the experimental results of local search solvers on the industrial PMS benchmark.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also note that Dist is the only local search solver that performs better than all complete solvers on crafted PMS instances, as witnessed by the results of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2014.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">But the performance of Dist is worse than core-based complete solvers on industrial instances, although it represents a significant improvement over previous local search solvers.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, for industrial PMS instances, although Dist significantly outperforms other local search solvers, its performance is still unsatisfactory, and there is an obvious gap between the performance of Dist and state-of-the-art complete solvers.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Additionally, we also compare DistUP with Dist and a state-of-the-art complete solver on industrial Weighted PMS instances from the MaxSAT Evaluation 2014.</a>
