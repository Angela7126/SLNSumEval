<a href="#4" id="4">As with the algorithmic teaching guidance in Experiment 1, we observe that heuristic teaching guidance is more effective in getting humans to provide more useful examples in the sub-condition with {a mathematical formula}r=8, where the optimal teaching sequence is longer (Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Looking closer at the examples chosen by participants, we see that their interpretation of the teaching guidance is in line with the borderline heuristic.</a>
