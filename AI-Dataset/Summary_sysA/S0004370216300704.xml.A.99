<a href="#0" id="0">To induce a qualitative model with respect to a certain attribute {a mathematical formula}Ai, we first compute the PDQ PD for the entire learning set: for each example, we compute the set of dependent values {a mathematical formula}D and find the total ordering of attribute values {a mathematical formula}Ai as explained in the previous two sections.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In a real world scenario, the researchers studying the effect of treatments do not know the model and thus work in the reverse direction: they measure the genetic parameters, carry out the experiment, and compile the data (Table 2) with a goal of learning the relation between the treatment and the genetic markers (Table 1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We again built a qualitative tree from the entire data set, taking the PDQ PD as the class variable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The resulting model explains a qualitative relation between mortality and the attribute {a mathematical formula}Ai, assuming ceteris paribus: how does the risk change if we change {a mathematical formula}Ai but keep all other attributes' values fixed.</a>
