<a href="#0" id="0">In this section, we elaborate the three models proposed for term translation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">They are the (A) term translation disambiguation model, (B) term translation consistency model and (C) term unithood model respectively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These suggest that the consistency of term translation is topic-sensitive.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The same terms may be translated in a different consistency pattern in different topics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore we calculate the translation consistency strength of a source term {a mathematical formula}tf based on topic distributions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We can also integrate the three models into SMT one-by-one with the term counting feature.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, we can only integrate the term translation disambiguation model into SMT as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also compared our term translation consistency model against another two models.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The term translation consistency model outperforms the baseline by 0.72 BLEU points.</a>
