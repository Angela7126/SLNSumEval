<a href="#0" id="0">It can be seen that stable semantics yields two extensions {a mathematical formula}{a,d} and {a mathematical formula}{b,c} for {a mathematical formula}F2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since c and d do not occur together in an extension there is an implicit conflict and thus {a mathematical formula}F2 is not analytic (for stable semantics).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the naive extensions of {a mathematical formula}F2 are given by {a mathematical formula}{a,d}, {a mathematical formula}{b,c}, {a mathematical formula}{c,d}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus c and d are not in an implicit conflict here, and the af is easily seen to be analytic for naive semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Indeed, by definition of naive semantics, two arguments occur together in a naive extension if and only if there is no attack between them and they are not self-attacking.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus not every af is analytic for naive semantics, but it is quite easy to see that every af can be turned into an equivalent analytic one over the same arguments, by just connecting the self-attacking arguments to any other argument.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Coming back to our example and to stable semantics, the question remains whether {a mathematical formula}F2 can be turned into an equivalent analytic one?</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This immediately means that for stage semantics there is an implicit conflict between {a mathematical formula}x¯ and {a mathematical formula}FC (argument a to be precise).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This also means that for semi-stable semantics there are no implicit conflicts between {a mathematical formula}x¯ and any argument from {a mathematical formula}FC.It remains to show that F indeed is analytic for semi-stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To this end we still need to investigate possible implicit conflicts between {a mathematical formula}FX and Y, between {a mathematical formula}FC and Y, as well as between {a mathematical formula}FX and {a mathematical formula}FC, and among arguments from {a mathematical formula}FC, as well as among arguments from Y.As mentioned before the range of any semi-stable extension will cover Y and {a mathematical formula}x¯ and either all of {a mathematical formula}FC or all of {a mathematical formula}FX.</a>
