<a href="#0" id="0">TRAMP seeks to learn action models in the target domain by transferring knowledge from source domains, assuming action models in source domains are already created by experts and can be transferred to the target domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Intuitively, we show the framework of TRAMP in bridging source and target domains based on the Web and the plan traces {a mathematical formula}T in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">TRAMP takes as inputs sets of action models from multiple source domains {a mathematical formula}{A1, â€¦ ,An}, bridges source and target domains based the Web and the plan traces, and outputs action models {a mathematical formula}A for the target domain.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This formalism is about transferring models from source domains and learning action models in the target domain.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, for each source domain {a mathematical formula}Di, we can encode the action models {a mathematical formula}Ai with a list of formulas {a mathematical formula}Fi.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For each action model set {a mathematical formula}Ai from source domain {a mathematical formula}Di, we encode {a mathematical formula}Ai with a set of formulas {a mathematical formula}Fi as is done by Step 3 of Algorithm 2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We would like to further compare TRAMP to another state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithm t-LAMP which explores transferring between source and target domains based on plan traces.</a>
