<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, if the PO in (3) is used in a task that also requires other actions, e.g., leaving a box on a table, a descriptor such as {a mathematical formula}ontable(box) will also be needed in the state representation but neglected in the PO of opening a door.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is because the descriptor {a mathematical formula}ontable(box) is not relevant to opening the door.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This degrades the accuracy of the estimate as learning proceeds, where it is worse for larger values of m, which makes the estimate biased toward c. To avoid this problem, we propose using a variable m, which comprises an estimate of the number of instances {a mathematical formula}n ˆ ∅ that still need to be experienced before we can consider the estimate as confident,{a mathematical formula} Eq.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is achieved by expanding the set {a mathematical formula}Rn as:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Rbasic is a set of POs with preconditions that include a single descriptor in addition to those that should change with the action, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}pchange ⊆ pexe is the set of descriptors that should change when the PO is executed, and {a mathematical formula}dj, {a mathematical formula}j=1, … ,|D+| is a descriptor from the list {a mathematical formula}D+, which contains the individual descriptors observed in the states before the execution of the action in the positive instances (5).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To perform this experiment, we defined planning problems where the goal position was in the upper left corner of the grid but different initial situations were used to demonstrate how a PO is generated from instructions and refined from unexpected effects.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A major feature of the proposed method that allows correct POs to be found is our development of an efficient approach that permits the robot to determine unchanged causative conditions as well as the actions that lead to the observed changes.</a>
