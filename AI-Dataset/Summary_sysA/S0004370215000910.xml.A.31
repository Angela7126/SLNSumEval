<a href="#0" id="0">This review aims to introduce AI researchers to the law as a rich test bed and important application field for logic-based AI research, with a particularly marked concern for logical models of legal argument.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a test bed, the law provides real, documented examples instead of artificial toy examples, and as an application field it may result in AI applications from which society as a whole, not just industry or consumers, can benefit.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">At first sight, one might think that such testing and application boils down to the use of techniques for knowledge representation and automated deduction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Once a legal text and a body of facts have been clearly represented in a formal language, the legal conclusions would follow from that representation as a matter of deduction.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, this view is too simplistic.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For one thing it ignores that law is not just a conceptual or axiomatic system but has social objectives and social effects, which may require that a legal rule is overridden or changed.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, legislators can never fully predict in which circumstances the law has to be applied, so legislation has to be formulated in general and abstract terms, such as ‘duty of care’, ‘misuse of trade secrets’ or ‘intent’, and qualified with general exception categories, such as ‘selfdefence’, ‘force majeure’ or ‘unreasonable’.</a>
