<a href="#0" id="0">The main activity in the competition is evaluation of state-of-the-art planners by running them on a set of planning problems and comparing their performance with some specific metrics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">1 shows the number of planners that solved a particular number of problems considering the whole benchmark, that is, those that were reused according to the procedure described in Appendix D and the new problems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">3 shows the evolution of the number of problems solved by all entrants in the time interval {a mathematical formula}(0,1800]s. Although selmax performs worse than a number of planners at the start, it performs as well as merge-and-shrink at the end of the interval and moderately better than lmcut and fd-autotune.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, the following planners were distinguished by their performance in the sequential optimal track of IPC-2011:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, we first show how the number of problems solved evolved over time in the range {a mathematical formula}(0,1800]s. Owing to the large number of participants in this track, Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">13 (page 101) shows the maximum memory required by all entrants in this track as a function of the number of problems solved by each of them.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Table 6 shows the final score for each planner, along with the number of problems solved and the success rate.</a>
