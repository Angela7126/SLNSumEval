<a href="#0" id="0">A model I of a normal logic program Π is an answer set under the standard answer set semantics if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(T Π I( ∅ ))if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − ))if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The conditions listed in Corollary 1 for an answer set of a normal logic program do not apply to a logic program with first-order formulas, because in the latter case the fixpoint {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) (resp.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − ))) would be a first-order theory instead of a set of ground atoms (e.g., see Example 7).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, these conditions suggest that instead of requiring each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I be included in {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )), answer sets of a logic program Π with first-order formulas can be defined by requiring that each{a mathematical formula}A ∈ Iis true in the fixpoint{a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − ))under the constraints{a mathematical formula}¬I − ; i.e., for each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I, {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This leads to the following principal definition.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In [27]'s formalism, ground aggregate atoms are essentially of the form{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}ai is a constant and each {a mathematical formula}Fi is a conjunction of ground atoms; an interpretation I satisfies A if {a mathematical formula}OP{ai|I satisfies Fi,1 ≤ i ≤ m} ⪰ b evaluates to true.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By Theorem 4, I is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}f Π I.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus I is a minimal model (standard answer set) of P in which A is true.The above proof shows that deciding whether a positive disjunctive logic program P has a standard answer set in which a given ground atom A is true can be reduced to deciding the existence of ordinary FLP resp.</a>
