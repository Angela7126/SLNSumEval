<a href="#0" id="0">The analysis of the self-interested case follows the equilibrium concept.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Specifically, since findings of agents are a priori uncertain, we use Bayesian Nash equilibria.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:8} A solution in this case is a set of search strategies, where each agent's strategy maximizes its own individual expected utility given the search strategies used by the other agents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The set of strategies available for each agent potentially includes engaging in search to some extent or completely avoiding search.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since it is possible that in the end none of the agents will actually engage in the search, in equilibrium, we define the agents' utilities for such cases as {a mathematical formula}v0.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">From the individual agent's point of view, when being self-interested, disclosing a “ good ” value that was obtained along the search is not beneficial, as this will likely discourage the other agents from resuming their search.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, the exchange of information in this case is mandatory and does not depend on the agents' desire, due to the justifications given in Section 2.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this case, as we prove in the following paragraphs, the agent's strategy needs to take into consideration not only the best value obtained so far, as in the “ no communication ” case, but also the remaining number of potential search periods.</a>
