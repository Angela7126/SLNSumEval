<a href="#0" id="0">The instances are not too hard â€“ Instances that none of the participating solvers can solve in the given time limit do not provide any information about the relative performance of the competing solvers.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is possible to solve such problems by solving the incrementally generated instances independently, however this might be very inefficient compared to an incremental SAT solver, which can reuse knowledge acquired while solving the previous instances (for example the learned clauses and variable activity statistics).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to make CryptoMiniSat adaptive, the top 5 parameter configurations were experimentally determined and then a classifier has been trained with benchmark problems from the previous SAT Competitions to select the best configuration for the problem at hand.</a>
