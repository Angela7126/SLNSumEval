<a href="#0" id="0">In order to sample the next state, three different methods are considered for choosing a value for each probability parameter {a mathematical formula}pi, subject to a set of constraints Φ : (1) the use of the same parameter values computed in the Bellman update called minimax_parameter_choice; (2) computing a random legal parameter value at each step during the trial called rand_parameter_choice; (3) computing a predefined legal parameter value only once called predefined_parameter_choice.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It should be noted that, after computing Equation (26), {a mathematical formula}Qt+1(x → ,a) and {a mathematical formula}Vt+1(x → ) end up having real values, different from the resulting ADD computed by SPUDD-IP backup (Equations (20) and (21)), where {a mathematical formula}QDDt+1(X → ,a) and {a mathematical formula}VDDt+1(X → ) are ADDs that represent the corresponding values for the complete set of states.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Notice that the size of CredalSetVerticesHash will be the number of credal sets for the predefined_parameter_choice method and less or equal to this number for the rand_parameter_choice method, given the fact that not all the states will be visited.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, in the worst case scenario the size is equal to {a mathematical formula}n ⁎ 2maxa,Xi ⁡ |paa(Xi)| ⁎ |A| (Equation (16)).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since we are considering binary variables and assume closed and convex credal sets, the number of vertices for each credal set is equal to 2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, the space required by CredalSetVerticesHash is proportional to a constant times {a mathematical formula}n ⁎ 2maxa,Xi ⁡ |paa(Xi)| ⁎ |A|.</a>
