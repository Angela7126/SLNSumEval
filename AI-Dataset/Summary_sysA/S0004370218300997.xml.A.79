<a href="#0" id="0">We denote the social welfare of the coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A) by {a mathematical formula}SW(P) (see, e.g., [35]):{a mathematical formula} When we need to explicitly identify the edges of the social network E (with the corresponding weight function) in a social welfare computation, we will write {a mathematical formula}SW(P,E).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As in case 1, since our k-cut is minimal we obtain a coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare.Case 3: there are more than {a mathematical formula}k − 1 negative edges.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The algorithm then finds the optimal coalition structure, denoted {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ , in the temporary graph (line 2), which is possible to do in polynomial time according to Corollary 2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The algorithm concludes that the optimal edges to add to G are all the edges that are within a coalition in {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ (line 3), and the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare in G after adding the edges in {a mathematical formula}E+ is {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to prove the correctness, we first show that {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare in G, after adding the edges in {a mathematical formula}E+.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Indeed, given a coalition structure P in {a mathematical formula}G ′ , every edge from {a mathematical formula}E+ ′ within a coalition {a mathematical formula}C ∈ P contributes {a mathematical formula}2 − Α to the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For a social network with general negative and positive weights,K-C-Membershipis co-NP-complete, for every fixed{a mathematical formula}k>2.First we show membership in co-NP by showing that the complement problem, i.e., determining that P is not a member of the k-coalitions-core, is in NP.</a>
