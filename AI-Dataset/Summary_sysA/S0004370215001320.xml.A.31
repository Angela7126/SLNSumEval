<a href="#0" id="0">The second module (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">1.2) interprets the visual data obtained from the first module and processes this information to infer the observed human intentions (the goal).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This module represents the core of our framework because it is responsible for identifying and extracting the meaning of human motions by generating semantic rules that define and explain these human motions, i.e., it infers human behaviors such as reach, take, pour, and cut.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">At this point, the system evaluates whether the input information provided can be used to infer the observed human activity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It should be noted that this is the step where most systems fail [6].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For example, if we only have objects such as bread, knife, and cucumber during the training stage, then the system will be limited to only accepting these values in order to infer human activities correctly.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, we enhance our system by the inclusion of a knowledge base, which means that if we have new objects such as pancake and spatula during the testing stage, then the system can look for their corresponding class and infer the human activity associated with that class.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, if the evaluation fails, the system will use its knowledge base to obtain an alternative and equivalent state for the system that contains instances of the desired class.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This represents a very important advantage of our system, as with the knowledge base means that we do not need to recompute the semantic rules every time we meet a new situation, i.e., the generated rules will even be preserved in different scenarios (see Section 4).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the next step, we tested the information obtained from module 1 (see Section 7.1), i.e., from the automatic segmentation of human motions and object properties.</a>
