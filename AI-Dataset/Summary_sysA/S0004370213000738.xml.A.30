<a href="#0" id="0">In theory, the approximation allows for the application of hypervolume-based MOEAs to optimization problems with an arbitrary number of objectives.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While there exist comparisons of approximation-based algorithms with other MOEAs [2], the effects of replacing the exact hypervolume calculation with an approximation algorithm on the overall performance of MOEAs have not been investigated in isolation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Apart from [36], there has been no empirical comparison of state-of-the-art MOEAs in which the exact hypervolume computation has been replaced by an approximation while fixing the other components of the algorithm.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The next section introduces the problem of determining the least hypervolume contributor.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We briefly review results on Monte Carlo approximation of the least hypervolume contributor as well as the exact hypervolume algorithm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this section, we summarize an exact algorithm and two approximation schemes for calculating the contributing hypervolume.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We compared the MO-CMA-ES using an approximation of the least hypervolume contributor to the results of the original MO-CMA-ES with exact hypervolume computation.</a>
