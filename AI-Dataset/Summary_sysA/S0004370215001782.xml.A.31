<a href="#0" id="0">These suggest that the consistency of term translation is topic-sensitive.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The same terms may be translated in a different consistency pattern in different topics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore we calculate the translation consistency strength of a source term {a mathematical formula}tf based on topic distributions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Although these two models are better than the baseline and the “ CountFeat ” method as shown in Table 12, they are worse than our term translation consistency model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our model outperforms the “ Cons-Count ” model by up to 0.33 BLEU points.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This suggests that the strategy of capturing information of how terms are consistently translated in the training data is better than the strategy of counting the times of a term being consistently translated in a test set on the fly.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The term translation consistency model outperforms the baseline by 0.72 BLEU points.</a>
