<a href="#0" id="0">When the solution of a BTMP requires the integration of the planner and an external solver, we have an instance of a two-dimensional problem class with controllable and uncontrollable variables on one axis and {a mathematical formula}Vdep and {a mathematical formula}Vspecial variables on the other.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">12 shows this two-dimensional space, divided into four regions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Classical temporal and metric planning problems occupy the bottom left quadrant, as they require neither uncontrollable variables nor external solvers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The Simple Voltage problem discussed in Section 4 is in the top left quadrant, being an instance of a BTMP but not requiring any external solver integration.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this paper we have defined a new class of problems, Bounded Trajectory Management Problems (BTMPs), and introduced AC voltage control as an instance of this class.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We have addressed the problem of AC voltage control by extending the planner popf2, to popf-tif, along two dimensions: Timed Initial Fluents on one dimension and integration with a specialised power flow equation solver on the other.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Electrical loads and generation profiles are modelled using TIFs, and the network voltage must always remain within bounds.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Actions can change the configurations of network components, causing the voltage to increase or decrease at the busbars.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To provide heuristic information in the presence of TIFs we add a lookahead mechanism that allows the planner to calculate the effect of the next TIF on the maintenance of the trajectory constraints.</a>
