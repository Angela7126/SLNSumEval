<a href="#0" id="0">Inspired by two observations: 1) the conflict between proximity and diversity requirements is aggravated with the increase of the number of objectives and 2) the Pareto dominance loses its effectiveness for a high-dimensional space but works well on a low-dimensional space, BiGE converts a given many-objective optimization problem into a bi-goal (objective) optimization problem regarding individuals' proximity and crowding degree, and then handles it using Pareto dominance in this bi-goal domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">BiGE treats an MOP with many objectives as a bi-goal optimization problem regarding minimizing the proximity of individuals towards the optimal direction and minimizing the crowding degree of individuals in the population.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">BiGE estimates the proximity (denoted as {a mathematical formula}fpr) of an individual p in the population by summing its value in each objective:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}fk(p) denotes the objective value of individual p in the kth objective, and m is the number of objectives.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An individual with high density in the bi-goal space does not mean that it is worse than individuals with low density but rather that there are some other individuals having similar proximity and crowding degree with it in the population (cf.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The HV results of BiGE with them are given in Table 8, where the result of the algorithm with {a mathematical formula}(0.5,1.5) is repeated for comparison.</a>
