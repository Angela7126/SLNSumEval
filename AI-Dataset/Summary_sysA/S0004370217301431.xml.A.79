<a href="#0" id="0">Building a strong plan Σ from a strong schedule for the TNU is analogous to the plain temporal planning case: each pair of corresponding {a mathematical formula} 〈 siast,sjaet 〉 ∈ Χ is a step of Σ , the time for the step is {a mathematical formula} Μ (siast) and, if a is controllable, the duration is {a mathematical formula} Μ (sjaet) − Μ (sjast).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this section, we present our compilation technique, which can be used to reduce any planning instance P having duration uncertainty into a temporal planning instance {a mathematical formula}P ′ in which all actions have controllable durations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The first step is to identify the set of variables {a mathematical formula}L ⊆ V that appear as effects of uncontrollable actions and are executed at a time depending on the end of the action.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Specifically, we first fix the maximal duration u as the only allowed duration for {a mathematical formula}a ′ and then add appropriate effects and conditions during the action to capture the uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The effects {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ are partitioned in two sets {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ l and {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ u to capture possible values within the uncertain action execution duration.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the translated instance R, all the conditions are also satisfied because the conditions are imposed via the Χ function that only checks that both the variable and its shadow fulfill the original condition.No conflicting effects are possible because of the conditions added in {a mathematical formula}Ca ′ E that prevents any modification of the interested shadow variables during the uncertainty intervals.Similarly, let</a>
