<a href="#0" id="0">A major breakthrough has been achieved by solving the long open problem of calculating certificates for a solver's result, leading to elegant approaches based on the analysis of resolution proofs [1], [19], to name one example.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In addition to the application of preprocessing prior to solving, the actual selection of benchmarks might have an influence on the performance of solvers and hence on the rankings in terms of solved instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since Bloqqer ( “ B ” ) and sQueezeBF ( “ D ” ) have different characteristics, we additionally selected the sequence {a mathematical formula}(A2D2B2C2)6 where the ordering of these two preprocessors is swapped and still Bloqqer is executed before Hiqqer3p ( “ C ” ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We did not consider the sequence {a mathematical formula}(A2D2C2B2)6 where only Bloqqer and SqueezeBF are swapped since, according to the results shown in Table 12, the execution ordering {a mathematical formula}(ADCB) solved one instance less than the execution ordering {a mathematical formula}(ADBC) in the sequence {a mathematical formula}(A2D2B2C2)6 we selected.</a>
