<a href="#0" id="0">In general, a weak strategy is a function that maps each assignment to uncontrollable durations satisfying {a mathematical formula} Γ (Y → u) (i.e.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The strategy imposes a relation between the controllable time points and the uncontrollable durations: {a mathematical formula}X → c=f¯(Y → ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If such a relation is expressible as a formula in a theory {a mathematical formula}T we can check whether {a mathematical formula}f¯ is a weak strategy for a given temporal problem by checking the existence of a point in {a mathematical formula} Γ (Y → u) that violates the free constraints.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">A linear strategy is such that the value of every controllable time point is obtained as a linear combination of {a mathematical formula}Y → u.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The problem of synthesizing a linear strategy is then equivalent to the problem of finding a suitable matrix A and vector {a mathematical formula}c → .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since the problem is weakly controllable, let {a mathematical formula}g(Y → ) be any weak strategy.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The algorithm then tries to build a linear strategy that uses uncontrollable durations in {a mathematical formula}p → only.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A possible linear strategy in this simplex is {a mathematical formula}f1=A1 ⋅ Y → u+c → 1 as follows.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A possible linear strategy in this simplex is {a mathematical formula}f2=A2 ⋅ Y → u+c → 2 as follows.</a>
