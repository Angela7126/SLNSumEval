<a href="#0" id="0">Note that we do not constrain {a mathematical formula}ph to be necessarily a sense of h and let it represent an arbitrary Wikipedia page; for instance, we allow the hypernym lemma person to be linked to the Wikipedia page Individual which is not a sense of person in Wikipedia.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, consider the Wikipedia page Aristotle and its hypernym lemma teacher.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, given the set {a mathematical formula}W âŠ‚ P of Wikipedia pages which have at least one category in common with p and share the hypernym lemma with it, we select the most frequent hypernym across these.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Pages which do have a corresponding page in English and whose hypernyms all coincide with those found in English (i.e., have the same hypernym aligned across languages).</a>
