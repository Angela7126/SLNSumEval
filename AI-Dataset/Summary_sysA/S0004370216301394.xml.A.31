<a href="#0" id="0">A common active learning heuristic is to choose the point that you are most uncertain about for the next experiment.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As before we use a GP on the log joint probability.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">At any given point in this GP we have an associated posterior variance of the GP.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, this variance corresponds to the uncertainty of the log joint probability whereas our objective is in learning the joint probability – which is a multiplicative factor away from the posterior.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">See Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">4.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, unlike in usual GP active learning methods [25], the variance of interest here is in the exponentiated GP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By observing that an exponentiated Gaussian is a log Normal distribution, the EV utility function is given by{a mathematical formula} Here {a mathematical formula} Μ t, Σ t2 are the posterior mean and variances of the GP at time t. The {a mathematical formula}exp ⁡ (2 Μ ( Θ +)) will squash high variances in the low likelihood regions and amplify low variances in the high likelihood regions.</a>
