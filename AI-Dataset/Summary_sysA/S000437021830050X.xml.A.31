<a href="#0" id="0">First, consider the zero-sum game of defense against destructive control.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We call it Ω -{a mathematical formula}zero-sum game for convenience.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}(x Ω ,a Ω ) be the equilibrium strategies for the defender and the attacker in this zero-sum game, and let {a mathematical formula}p0 Ω be probability that Ω wins the game given {a mathematical formula}(x Ω ,a Ω ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that even when the attacker's goal is to let candidate Υ win, if the defender plays {a mathematical formula}x Ω and the attacker responds optimally by choosing a strategy {a mathematical formula}a Υ Ω =g(x Ω ), where {a mathematical formula}a Υ Ω =arg ⁡ maxa ⁡ P Υ (x Ω ,a), the probability that Ω wins given {a mathematical formula}(x Ω ,a Υ Ω ) will be no less than {a mathematical formula}p0 Ω .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is because playing {a mathematical formula}a Υ Ω indicates that the attacker deviates from the optimal strategy in the zero-sum game, which makes the defender better off.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consequently, the solution of this zero-sum game provides a lower bound on the defender's optimal utility against constructive control.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given Proposition 3, we can further observe that the defender's equilibrium strategy {a mathematical formula}xv in the Υ -zero-sum game is also her optimal strategy to defend against constructive control whenever the upper bound on the defender's utility is tight.</a>
