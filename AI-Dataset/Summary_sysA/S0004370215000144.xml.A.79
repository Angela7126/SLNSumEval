<a href="#0" id="0">Apart from the quality of the solutions, typical parameters used to compare planner performance in previous IPCs include the number of instances solved (or, alternatively, the overall problem solving success rate, defined as the percentage of problems solved{sup:7}), and the raw speed at which solutions were generated.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the third IPC, double hits were used in addition to ordinary analysis when studying plan quality; when observing runtime, the organizers assigned an infinitely bad speed to the planner that did not solve a particular case [37].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The organizers of the fifth IPC adopted a different, but similar, methodology: when comparing runtime they assigned twice the time limit to cases for which no solution was generated, observing that this was the minimum value for which the performance gap for a problem solved by one planner and not solved by the other is greater than the performance gap for any problem solved by both.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To prove this, observe that the score for planner p when using the best solution found as a reference for a specific planning task i is{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Î” ip is the excess committed by planner p over the best solution found (and necessarily equal to zero for at least one planner) when solving instance i.</a>
