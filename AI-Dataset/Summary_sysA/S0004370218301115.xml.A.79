<a href="#0" id="0">In [10] the postulates (that we recalled in Subsection 2.2) proposed in [6] for shielded contractions on belief sets were adapted to the belief bases context: Relative success:{a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α =A or {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ Cn(A ∼ Α ).Persistence:If {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β , then {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α ⊢ Β .Success propagation:If {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β and {a mathematical formula} ⊢ Β → Α , then {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α ⊢ Α .Conjunctive constancy:If {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α =A ∼ Β =A, then {a mathematical formula}A ∼ ( Α ∧ Β )=A.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We note that, if {a mathematical formula}R ≠ L satisfies non-retractability propagation, then it is not logically closed i.e., the fact that {a mathematical formula}R ⊢ Α does not imply that {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let A be a belief base, ∼ be an operator on A,{a mathematical formula}R={ Α :A ∼ Α ⊬ Α }and ÷ be the operator defined (for all Α ) by the following condition:{a mathematical formula}where − is an operator on A that satisfies success, inclusion, uniformity and relevance.</a>
