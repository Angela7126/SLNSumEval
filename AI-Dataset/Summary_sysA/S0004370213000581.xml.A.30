<a href="#0" id="0">In addition to the bag-level classification function {a mathematical formula}F(X), many methods try to learn an instance-level classification function {a mathematical formula}f(x → i) that operates directly on the instances {a mathematical formula}x → i.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If we look at the composition of the bags in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">5, we find that positive bags are characterized by containing instances of both class 1 and class 2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast, negative bags are characterized by containing either instances of class 1 or instances of class 2, but not both of them at the same time.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, it is not enough to learn an (instance-level) model of the classes of instances, but we must learn a bag-level model about the composition of the whole bag.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As we will see, this bag-level information can be learned if we use a BS or ES method.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Indeed, we will see that both BS and ES are successful in both the problem shown in Fig.</a>
