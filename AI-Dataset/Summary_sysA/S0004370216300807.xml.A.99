<a href="#0" id="0">In particular, {a mathematical formula} Γ .N is the set containing the starting node from which the evaluation of an expression begins and the set of ending nodes, that is, the expression endpoints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A graph region Γ captures the specification given via a navigational expression e starting from a single node of the graph where {a mathematical formula} Γ .E Γ and {a mathematical formula} Γ .V Γ are edges and nodes navigated during the evaluation of e. The need to start from a node (or a set of nodes) is motivated by the fact that our framework is meant to be used on the Web, and thus, it is infeasible to start the evaluation of a navigational expression from all nodes of the Web graph (assuming one can enumerate all of them).</a>
