<a href="#0" id="0">Considering the {a mathematical formula}T1 in Example 1, it is easy to derive the following axiom:{a mathematical formula} Given this, it is sufficient to derive the following axiom, in which we use underline to highlight the expressions appearing in the above axiom:{a mathematical formula} Note that this can be achieved by a tractable inference rule:{a mathematical formula} or the combination of two tractable inference rules:{a mathematical formula} Although there are other more complex axioms in {a mathematical formula}T1, such as axiom (4), they are not necessarily required in this step of inference.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The above theorem shows that when a nominal-free ontology contains no role chains except the role transitivity axioms, its ABox approximate reasoning can be significantly simplified due to the fact that intermediate results of form {a mathematical formula}a: âˆƒ r.A no longer need to be computed and maintained.</a>
