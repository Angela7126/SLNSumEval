<a href="#0" id="0">A fault is denoted as f, and it is modeled, in our work, as an unexpected step change in a system model parameter value, {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ Θ , and F represents the fault set.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we focus on the problem where the diagnosis model {a mathematical formula}S is diagnosable and the user provides the initial distribution of the measurement and fault sets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, from the subset {a mathematical formula}Fi of fault candidates, the parameter estimation block performs fault identification to determine the fault that has occurred in the system (described by the parameter associated to the fault, {a mathematical formula} Θ i ⁎ ), together with its estimation accuracy, {a mathematical formula}Ei2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, since we work under the single fault assumption, we consider that each PC will only be used to estimate one parameter from the set {a mathematical formula} Θ i in {a mathematical formula}Mh1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We define a nonlinear optimization problem using the inputs {a mathematical formula}Ui and the outputs {a mathematical formula}Yi of the PC to estimate the value of the parameter, {a mathematical formula} Θ j ∈ Θ i related to the fault {a mathematical formula}fj.</a>
