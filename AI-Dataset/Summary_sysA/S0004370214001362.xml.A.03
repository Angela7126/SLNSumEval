<a href="#0" id="0">Pseudo-tags are tags that are assigned to a track algorithmically, based on the content representation of the track.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As the number of tags in a track increases, so does the recommendation quality, and so, intuitively, as the number of tags T increases, the number of pseudo-tags P should decrease.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using this method of combining pseudo-tags with tags, we are now able to represent every track by a hybrid vector h. For tracks which are well-tagged, the tag vector will be the main contributor to h, and therefore allow recommendation to be made using the strengths of tag representation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The effect of pseudo-tags on tracks with a large number of tags is refinement.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">That is, the recommendation quality of a hybrid system must always be greater than the maximum quality of both content and tags, for all given numbers of tags in a representation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">T is the number of tags in the tag vector of track s, and P is the number of pseudo-tags generated for track s.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The dynamic combination of these pseudo-tags with existing tags creates a hybrid representation which assigns more or less influence to pseudo-tags depending on how well-tagged a track is already.</a>
