<a href="#1" id="1">We proceed to examine some aspects of the stability of {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ , the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare, on general graphs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ does not necessarily belong to the k-coalitions-core, as illustrated in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We can also observe that for all {a mathematical formula}0< Α <2 the number of added edges is almost the same.</a>
