<a href="#0" id="0">Measuring the semantic similarity of pairs of linguistic items can be performed at different linguistic levels.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this work, we focus on three main levels: senses, words, and sentences.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Table 1 lists example semantic similarity judgments for pairs belonging to each of these three linguistic levels.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We review the techniques for semantic similarity measurement according to the linguistic level they can be applied to: sense, word, and text level, and summarize the most important approaches at each level.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to get more insight into the effect of ADW's disambiguation step on the final performance when measuring the similarity of word pairs, we carried out a series of experiments where no disambiguation was performed on the two linguistic items.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the absence of the disambiguation step, a semantic signature for a linguistic item is generated by initializing the PPR algorithm from all the nodes (i.e., synsets) associated with that linguistic item, rather than the specific disambiguated synsets obtained as a result of the alignment-based disambiguation (see Section 5.1).</a>
