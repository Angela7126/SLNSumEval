<a href="#0" id="0">The CS preferred offer to the {a mathematical formula}SPg requests all of the chips (i.e., one gray and 10 red chips) from the {a mathematical formula}SPg player.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Similarly, the CS preferred offer to the {a mathematical formula}SPy requests all of the chips from the {a mathematical formula}SPy player.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Ties are broken towards the {a mathematical formula}SPg player, since the sum of the utilities for the CS preferred offer to both {a mathematical formula}SPg and {a mathematical formula}SPy players is equal (Equation (8)).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If it is the negotiation stage of an odd round and it has received offers{a mathematical formula}O2and{a mathematical formula}O1and let{a mathematical formula}Oldenote the best offer for the CS player (breaking ties first towards the offer that maximizes the social welfare (Equation(8)) and then towards the offer that is made by{a mathematical formula}SPgplayer):{a mathematical formula}The CS player will accept{a mathematical formula}Olonly if{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Correctness of expected utility definitionsLet O be an offer that is accepted at state s,{a mathematical formula}Ps ⁎ is a preferred path that is followed by the CS player starting at state s and that both CS and SP players follow the equilibrium strategies defined inTheorem 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We found that an offer {a mathematical formula}OT ˆ s,i with a benefit threshold of 50 to the customer player (i.e., {a mathematical formula}ucs(s,OT ˆ s,i)=50) satisfied both of the conditions defined above.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We therefore programmed a data-driven agent termed SP-RAPD that makes offers at state s in the game as follows: If a preferred offer exists at s that provides the offer {a mathematical formula}OT ˆ s,i with a minimal acceptance threshold, then the agent makes the offer {a mathematical formula}OT ˆ s,i (otherwise, it does not make any offer).</a>
