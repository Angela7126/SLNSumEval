<a href="#0" id="0">We also develop theoretical analysis that extends the sample complexity result of [29] for dictionary learning using standard sparse coding to the smooth sparse coding case.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This result specifically shows how the sample complexity depends on the {a mathematical formula}L1 norm of the kernel function used.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our contributions lead to improved classification accuracy in conjunction with significant computational speedup.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Below we summarize our main contributions:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The distance function {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) may be one of the standard distance functions, for example, based on the {a mathematical formula}Lp norm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Alternatively, {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) may be expressed by domain experts, learned from data before the sparse coding training, or learned jointly with the dictionary and codes during the sparse coding training.</a>
