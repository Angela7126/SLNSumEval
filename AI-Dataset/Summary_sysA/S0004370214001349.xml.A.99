<a href="#0" id="0">Since previous research on algebra problem solving has pointed out that computational parsimony is an important factor in a quality cognitive model of human problem solving [28], when faced with a new task, the learning algorithm uses the existing grammar from previous tasks to build the smallest number of most probable parse trees for the new records.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to further understand how transfer learning affects learning efficiency, we carried out a second experiment where the previous grammar is not a subset of the current grammar.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, since we randomly pick features from randomly generated grammars in the overlapping task transfer, it is possible that the selected feature is at a relatively low level in the hierarchy, and thus corresponds to very short subsequences or one specific action sequence (no disjunctions).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to understand whether the proposed algorithm is a good model of real students, we carried out a controlled simulation study in algebra using the +Transfer+Feature Focus learner.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Accelerated future learning, in which learning proceeds more effectively and more rapidly because of prior learning, is an essential measure of robust learning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">With the current extension, the representation is acquired by a deep feature learner before skill learning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, the acquired representation does not change during the course of skill acquisition.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As we will discuss in later sections, one possible future step is to use the feedback from the skill learning process to further refine the representation learning process.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As we have mentioned above, SimStudent is able to acquire production rules in solving complicated problems, but requires a set of operator functions given as prior knowledge.</a>
