<a href="#0" id="0">Then, Φ holds following{a mathematical formula}a¯,o¯iff{a mathematical formula}bI ⊨ rga ′ ¯o¯ ′ ⁎ ( Φ ).Let us start with the case of a single deterministic action a and observation o, such that o is irrelevant to all propositions in Φ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From our previous results we have that l holds following {a mathematical formula}a,o iff {a mathematical formula}bI ⊨ rga,o ⁎ ( Φ ) iff {a mathematical formula}bI ⊨ rga ⁎ ( Ω a,o → Φ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have that Φ holds following {a mathematical formula}ano-obs iff {a mathematical formula}bI ⊨ (true → rgano-obs,no-obs ⁎ ( Φ )) iff {a mathematical formula}bI ⊨ (true → rga ⁎ ( Φ )), i.e., iff {a mathematical formula}bI ⊨ rga ⁎ ( Φ ) (because, naturally, the initial state formula is satisfiable).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The time and space complexity of determining whether some literal l is valid following{a mathematical formula}a¯,o¯is{a mathematical formula}O(2cw ⋅ |a¯| ⋅ poly(|bIa¯,o¯|)), where{a mathematical formula}w=wa¯ ′ cis the contextual causal width of l with respect to the set of actions in{a mathematical formula}a¯ ′ , the determinized sequence of actions executed, and{a mathematical formula}|bIa¯,o¯|is the size of the initial state formula conjoined with regressed, past observations, and converted into PI form or some other form supporting polynomial time validity checks.This follows immediately from Theorem 8 after we notice that the regressed formula will only contain causally relevant variables that appear in the determinized sequence {a mathematical formula}a¯ ′ , as we no longer need to regress through o.</a>
