<a href="#0" id="0">Also finding a strategy whose expected utility is within a factor of {a mathematical formula}2p of the maximum expected utility, where p denotes the number of numerical parameters in the model, is NP-hard, even in polytree-shaped diagrams (with variables taking on arbitrarily many values).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A limid can be interpreted as a concise description of the set of Bayesian networks that represent the joint distributions {a mathematical formula}P(S,A| Δ ) induced by strategies Δ . Additionally, as noted by Cooper [25], the expected utility of any strategy Δ in a limid with a single value variable V can be reduced to the computation of the marginal probability {a mathematical formula}P(V ′ =1) in the Bayesian network that represents {a mathematical formula}P(V ′ ,S,A| Δ )=P(V ′ |Pa(V))P(S,A| Δ ), where {a mathematical formula}V ′ is a binary state variable with the same parent set of V, and {a mathematical formula}P(V ′ =1|Pa(V)) ∝ V(Pa(V)).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A simple inductive argument on {a mathematical formula}i=1, … ,n shows that {a mathematical formula}Sn ′ =S1S2 ⋯ Sn, so that for any strategy Δ we have that{a mathematical formula} Finally, we specify the value variable R as{a mathematical formula} An argument similar to that of the numbers {a mathematical formula}P(Si=1|Di=1) shows that R is computed in time polynomial in b.</a>
