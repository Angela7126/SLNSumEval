<a href="#0" id="0">The key contributions of this new theory are: (1) to represent sentiments as probability distributions over a continuous affective space, thereby allowing these sentiments to be dynamic and uncertain; (2) to propose a new kind of agent based on affect control theory that has the ability to learn affective identities of interactants; (3) to integrate the affective dynamics proposed by affect control theory with standard POMDP-based artificial intelligence; and (4) to introduce explicit utility functions to affect control theory that parsimoniously trade-off affective and propositional goals for a human-interactive agent.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A POMDP consists of a finite set {a mathematical formula}X of states; a finite set {a mathematical formula}A of actions; a stochastic transition model {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁡ :X×A → Δ (X), with {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁡ (x ′ |x,a) denoting the probability of moving from state x to {a mathematical formula}x ′ when action a is taken, and {a mathematical formula} Δ (X) is a distribution over {a mathematical formula}X; a finite observation set {a mathematical formula} Ω x; a stochastic observation model with {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁡ ( Ω x|x) denoting the probability of making observation {a mathematical formula} Ω x while the system is in state x; and a reward assigning {a mathematical formula}R(x,a,x ′ ) to state transition x to {a mathematical formula}x ′ induced by action a.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The belief state can be used to compute expected values of quantities of interest defined on the state space, such as the expected deflection{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}D(s) is the deflection of s. This gives us a way to connect more closely with emotional “ labels ” from appraisal theories.</a>
