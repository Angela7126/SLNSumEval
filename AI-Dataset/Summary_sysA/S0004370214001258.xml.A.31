<a href="#1" id="1">Instance: A Bayesian network {a mathematical formula}B, partitioned into a set of observed evidence variables E, a set of explanation variables H, a set of ‘ relevant ’ intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I+ that are marginalized over, and a set of ‘ irrelevant ’ intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I − that are not marginalized over.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that MFE is not guaranteed to give the MAP explanation, unless we marginalize over all intermediate variables (i.e., consider all variables to be relevant).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When the set of irrelevant variables is non-empty, the most frugal explanation may differ from the MAP explanation, even when using a voting strategy based on all joint value assignments to the irrelevant intermediate variables, since both explanations are computed differently.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Instance: A Bayesian network {a mathematical formula}B=(GB,Pr), where V is partitioned into evidence variables E with joint value assignment e, explanation variables H, and intermediate variables I, and a designated variable {a mathematical formula}I ∈ I.</a>
