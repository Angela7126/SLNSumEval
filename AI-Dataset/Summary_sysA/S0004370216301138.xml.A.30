<a href="#0" id="0">Lingeling[16] is a CDCL solver with 241 parameters (making it the solver with the largest configuration space in the CSSC 2013).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">2 visualizes the improvements algorithm configuration yielded for the best-performing solver Clasp-3.0.4-p8 on these benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Improvements were particularly large on the GI instances, where algorithm configuration decreased the number of timeouts from 42 to 6.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 5 summarizes the results we obtained for all solvers on these benchmarks, showing that configuration also substantially improved the performance of many other solvers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The table also aggregates results across both benchmark families to yield overall results for the crafted SAT+UNSAT track.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">While Forl-nodrup showed the best default performance and benefited substantially from configuration (#timeouts reduced from 135 to 98), Clasp-3.0.4-p8 improved even more (#timeouts reduced from 139 to 96).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For each of the four tracks of CSSC 2014, we configured the solvers submitted to the track on each of the three benchmark families from that track and aggregated results across the respective test instances.</a>
