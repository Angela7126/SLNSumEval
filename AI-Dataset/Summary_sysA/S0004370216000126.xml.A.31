<a href="#0" id="0">In this section we discuss Step 1 of the EML design process, i.e.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">the definition of the core combinatorial structure of the optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Informally, this is the part of the optimization model that can be designed by a domain expert in a traditional fashion.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Defining the combinatorial structure requires one to identify the input and output of the Empirical Model, i.e.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">to define which part of the final model should be extracted from data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This decision affects the Machine Learning techniques that can be used to extract the Empirical Model.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For our example problems, we have already provided a first definition of the core combinatorial structure in the two base models from Section 3.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In both cases, the input of the Empirical Model is given by the mapping variables.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The EM output for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is given by the efficiency of each core: this implies that some kind of regression technique must be used to obtain the Empirical Model.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The output for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax is a vector of binary variables ({a mathematical formula}effk=1 iff core k has “ high ” efficiency), hence in this case the Empirical Model is a classifier.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Core model for CP We have designed CP models for the two dispatching problems presented in Section 3.</a>
