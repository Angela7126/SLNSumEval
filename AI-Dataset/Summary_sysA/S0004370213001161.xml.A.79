<a href="#0" id="0">From the actions of line 14 in Algorithm 2 this implies that there exists an admissible set {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊃ S s.t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In fact, {a mathematical formula}U ′ is the set of total orders that Algorithm 5 investigates for enumerating preferred extensions as we will establish later.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Assume{a mathematical formula} By Algorithm 5, lines 12 and 14{a mathematical formula} By Proposition 5 (which basically states the conditions under which an argument is labelled IN or left BLANK by Algorithm 6) and after simplification{a mathematical formula} This contradicts the definition of {a mathematical formula}U ′ (Definition 7): recall that {a mathematical formula}U ′ contains total value orders including those which satisfy the previous implication.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The bottom line is, our approach is faster than any other mechanism that would consider every specific audience {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ U while our algorithms only consider critical audiences {a mathematical formula}U ′ ⊆ U as stated by Proposition 4, which is a key contribution of our algorithms.</a>
