<a href="#0" id="0">The best response of j is:{a mathematical formula} Our main result in the Bayesian model is that, assuming buyer types are independent and drawn from the same distribution, a vendor cannot benefit by using a discount schedule instead of a fixed price unless other vendors also use schedules.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that this can be achieved with the schedule {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ (j)=vj, thus the optimal schedule {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ extracts from any buyer her full expected value:{a mathematical formula} which approaches n as {a mathematical formula} Ε → 0.Suppose instead that the vendor uses a fixed price.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">With any fixed price of the form {a mathematical formula}pj=p ⁎ (j)=vj,j ∈ [n] — clearly there is no reason to use any other price — the vendor will achieve revenue of:{a mathematical formula} Thus for any n, we can set Ε sufficiently small so that the revenue from any fixed price is arbitrarily close to 1, whereas the best discount schedule attracts revenue that approaches n. □</a>
