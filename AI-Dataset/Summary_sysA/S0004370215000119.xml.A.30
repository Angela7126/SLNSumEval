<a href="#0" id="0">The core is non-empty only for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ for standard coalitional games [2], i.e., AC contains all possible coalitions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, we concentrate on finding the core for optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From this definition, it is clear that if the weak Ε -core is non-empty for one coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CSA, it is also non-empty for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Similar to the core, we can show that there will be no blocking coalition structure, and the following theorem holds:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is sufficient to show that if the weak Ε -core{sup:+} is non-empty, the weak Ε -core for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ is non-empty.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Assume the weak Ε -core{sup:+} is non-empty.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The least value Ε of the weak least core for the optimal coalition structure is equivalent to that of the weak least{a mathematical formula}core+.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The weak least{a mathematical formula}core+is identical to the weak least core for the optimal coalition structure{a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ , i.e., any payoff vector in the weak least{a mathematical formula}core+is also in the weak least core for{a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ and vice versa.</a>
