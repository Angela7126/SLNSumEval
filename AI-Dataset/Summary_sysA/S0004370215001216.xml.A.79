<a href="#0" id="0">The following statement is required by Proposition 6: All elements of{a mathematical formula}x Σ are generated with the same number of symmetries of Σ , i.e.,{a mathematical formula}|{ Σ ∈ Σ :x Σ =y}|=|{ Σ ∈ Σ :x Σ =z}|, ∀ y,z ∈ x Σ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Again, and similarly to most proposed lex encodings, the first and foremost reason why such encodings are not appropriate in the continuous context is that they come in factorial number with respect to the number of variables in the worst case, without an efficient (poly-time) method for generating them, and involve all the variables implied in the symmetry in a formula much more complex than rlex constraints.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A counter-productive performance occur for only 1 run out of the 68 experiments, the instance of problem Eiger at dimension {a mathematical formula}n=100, and the loss in solving time is {a mathematical formula}2% of 22.3 s, i.e., 0.3 s. A more detailed look at this problem reveals it has only a cyclic symmetry group (order n), very simple binary quadratic constraints and only two fully frontier solutions (see Section 5.2.1 for a detailed analysis of the influence of these features).</a>
