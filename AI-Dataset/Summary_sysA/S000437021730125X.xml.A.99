<a href="#0" id="0">We provide an upper bound on the number of times the algorithm selects a suboptimal expert set for a given problem, which depends on the target accuracy level and the true qualities (Theorem 4.2).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We now describe the framework with optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Recall that a task {a mathematical formula}t ∈ {1, … ,T} needs to be completed with an assured accuracy with the optimal cost in a sequential fashion.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence for each task t, the following optimization problem needs to be solved.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The output of the algorithm will be the subset {a mathematical formula}St and predicted opinion {a mathematical formula}y ˆ t for each task t. The predicted opinion {a mathematical formula}y ˆ t is decided based on an aggregation function (AGGREGATE) in Definition 4.1 with noisy opinions {a mathematical formula}y ˜ (St) collected from the expert set {a mathematical formula}St as input.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The proposed algorithm is adaptive exploration separated and the number of suboptimal rounds for CCB-S is bounded by {a mathematical formula}2(h − 1( Δ ))2ln ⁡ (2n Μ ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If an expert r does not belong to{an inline-figure}for some task t in CCB-SE, then, with known qualities, GA algorithm has a candidate solution of cost less than or equal to any candidate solution containing r with probability{a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ).With true qualities, in GA algorithm, the elements {a mathematical formula}1, … ,k precedes r due to {a mathematical formula}cka ˆ k − ≤ cra ˆ r+ with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ).As {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,k} meets the accuracy constraint with LCB, they meet it with true qualities also (with high probability).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, there exists a {a mathematical formula}p ∈ {1, … ,k}, which belongs to a big set in the run of GA with true qualities.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We extend the algorithm to the AAB setting by exploring all the experts with probability {a mathematical formula} Ε t and selecting minimum cost expert subset meeting the constraint with empirically estimated qualities with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Ε t).</a>
