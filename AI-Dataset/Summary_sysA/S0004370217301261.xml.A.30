<a href="#0" id="0">We introduce a new variant of {a mathematical formula}LA ⁎ called Rational Lazy{a mathematical formula}A ⁎ ({a mathematical formula}RLA ⁎ ), as well as a new variant of {a mathematical formula}LIDA ⁎ called Rational Lazy{a mathematical formula}IDA ⁎ ({a mathematical formula}RLIDA ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, if {a mathematical formula}h2 is expected to be helpful for more than half of the nodes n on which the search algorithm evaluates {a mathematical formula}h2(n), then one should simply use {a mathematical formula}LA ⁎ or {a mathematical formula}LIDA ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have described two new algorithms, {a mathematical formula}RLA ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}RLIDA ⁎ , which are based on rational metareasoning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These algorithms have a decision rule based on some parameters, most importantly {a mathematical formula}ph2 (the probability that {a mathematical formula}h2 is helpful) and {a mathematical formula}ph1 (the probability that {a mathematical formula}h1 is helpful).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, looking at search time, we see the benefits of using {a mathematical formula}RLA ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Examining the geometric mean of the number of expanded nodes in each search algorithm (Table A.21 provides per-domain results), we can see that, {a mathematical formula}IDA ⁎ MAX has the fewest expanded nodes, and {a mathematical formula}LIDA ⁎ is very close.</a>
