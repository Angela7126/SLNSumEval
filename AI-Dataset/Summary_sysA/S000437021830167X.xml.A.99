<a href="#0" id="0">In order to find an optimal DAG for the structure learning problem, it is sufficient to work with{a mathematical formula} Unfortunately there is no way of applying Lemma 1 without computing the scores of all candidate sets, and hence it provides no speed up for building the list (it is nevertheless useful for later optimizations, but that is not the focus of this work).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In case this computation of {a mathematical formula}H(Y| Π ⁎ ) is not considered worthwhile, or if we simply want a faster approach to prune parent sets, we can resort to a more general version of Theorem 1, as given by Theorem 2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Theorem 3 can be used to bound the number of parent sets per variable, even before computing parent sets for them, with the low computation cost of computing the empirical entropy of each variable once (hence overall cost of {a mathematical formula}O(n ⋅ N) time).</a>
