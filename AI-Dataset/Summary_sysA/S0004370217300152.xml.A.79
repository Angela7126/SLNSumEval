<a href="#0" id="0">Note that, for any normalized capacity v and any set {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, we have:{a mathematical formula} This is due to the fact that all “ bottom ” criteria precede all “ top ” criteria in the permutation, and so the difference of performance between any two successive criteria is equal to zero, except for the last “ bottom ” criterion and the first “ top ” criterion, which is equal to one (refer to Definition 3).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Indeed, we have {a mathematical formula} Θ P ′ ⊆ Θ P for any set of preference statements {a mathematical formula}P ′ ⊇ P; then, for any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X and any {a mathematical formula} ℓ ∈ {1, … ,q}, we have:{a mathematical formula} and so, the maximum minimax regret cannot increase by adding new preference statements; in the subsection devoted to numerical tests, we will see that, in practice, it strictly decreases when queries are chosen in a reasoned way.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using Proposition 1 with {a mathematical formula}A=Ax, from the linear program we can remove all monotonicity constraints involving a variable {a mathematical formula}vA that is not present in the objective function of Equation (26) (i.e.</a>
