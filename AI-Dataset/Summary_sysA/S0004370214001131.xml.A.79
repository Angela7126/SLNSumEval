<a href="#0" id="0">The result, proved in Theorem 7, is based on a preliminary lemma, which roughly states that if a semantics S is top-down decomposable then a kind of top-down decomposability relation holds for any labelling {a mathematical formula}L ∈ FS(AF,I,LI,RI) w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By definition of {a mathematical formula}FST, there are no undec-labelled arguments according to L. Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}FST always returns a set of complete labellings, bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics entails that {a mathematical formula}L ∈ LCO(AF), thus L is a stable labelling.Finally, similarly to the proof of Theorem 3, by Proposition 5 it holds that {a mathematical formula}FST is the canonical local function of stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">that there is a unique minimal labelling in {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI): this is obtained as a by-product of the proof.First we prove that {a mathematical formula}L ′ ↓ Ar is a minimal labelling of {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since {a mathematical formula}L ′ is by definition a complete labelling and complete semantics is top-down decomposable (see Theorem 3), it holds that {a mathematical formula}L ′ ↓ I ′ ∈ FCO(AF ′ ↓ I ′ , ∅ , ∅ , ∅ ) and {a mathematical formula}L ′ ↓ Ar ∈ FCO(AF,I,L ′ ↓ I,RI).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since by Proposition 2 it holds that {a mathematical formula}L ′ ↓ I=LI, the latter condition can be rewritten as {a mathematical formula}L ′ ↓ Ar ∈ FCO(AF,I,LI,RI), entailing in particular that {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI) is nonempty.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Suppose now by contradiction that {a mathematical formula}L ′ ↓ Ar is not a minimal labelling returned by {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI): then there is a labelling {a mathematical formula}L ⁎ ∈ FCO(AF,I,LI,RI) such that {a mathematical formula}L ⁎ ⊑ L ′ ↓ Ar and {a mathematical formula}L ⁎ ≠ L ′ ↓ Ar.</a>
