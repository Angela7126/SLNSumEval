<a href="#0" id="0">The fuzzy FOL generalization of the knowledge base provides a continuous and differentiable surrogate of the initial logic formulas such that {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ Φ i( ⋅ ) ≤ 1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, the resulting constraints {a mathematical formula}1 − Φ i( ⋅ )=0 are continuous and differentiable as well, and this will allow to train the query functions using any gradient-based learning schema.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}(0),(i,ii,iii,iv,v): learning from the supervised data first and, after the training data has been learned, introducing all the other constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The following KB was used for the task:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The 0 formulas express the fitting of the supervised data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After training the SBR models using the minimum t-norm and the linear kernel for different {a mathematical formula} Λ c meta-parameters, the best model has been selected on the validation set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, Semantic Based Regularization collective classification (SBR-CC) has been performed over the test set using the selected model.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The SBR-CC results have been compared against Semantic Based Regularization (SBR), where no collective classification is performed on the test set, but the trained kernel machines are directly used to perform the predictions.</a>
