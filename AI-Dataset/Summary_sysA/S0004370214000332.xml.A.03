<a href="#0" id="0">The problem is to identify at each position i a pair from {a mathematical formula}Di such that the overall energy E is minimized.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, DEE pre-processing is usually followed by an {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A Cost Function Network (CFN) is a pair {a mathematical formula}(X,W) where {a mathematical formula}X={1, … ,n} is a set of n variables and W is a set of cost functions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">All costs being non-negative, the value of this constant function, {a mathematical formula}w ∅ , provides a lower bound on the cost of any assignment.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Enforcing a local consistency may increase {a mathematical formula}E ∅ and thus improve the lower bound on the optimal cost.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The resulting network is equivalent to the original network, but it has an increased lower bound {a mathematical formula}E ∅ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}k=3.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, if the selected pair {a mathematical formula}(u,r) for the variable i satisfies Eq.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For every pair of values of different variables {a mathematical formula}(ir,js) involved in a binary energy term, there is a Boolean variable {a mathematical formula}pirjs that is equal to 1 iff the pair {a mathematical formula}(ir,js) is used.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For every value {a mathematical formula}ir, there is again a Boolean variable {a mathematical formula}dir that is equal to 1 iff {a mathematical formula}i=r.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Several solvers were unable to solve any of the instances in the 9000 s allocated globally per problem for each approach (including any pre-processing used in the method such as DEE in the {a mathematical formula}DEE/A ⁎ approach).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To confirm this, we computed the number of nodes explored by osprey during {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In computational biology, exact methods for solving the CPD problem combine dominance analysis (DEE) and an {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search.</a>
