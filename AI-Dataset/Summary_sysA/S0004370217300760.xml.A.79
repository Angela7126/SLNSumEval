<a href="#0" id="0">In order to do so, the agent maintains two separate data structures, one for the LB_Reports received from its parent, and a second one, called {a mathematical formula}LB_Adjust, only for constrained descendants.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The {a mathematical formula}LB_Adjust only contains the difference between the LB_Reports received from the agent's parent, and the LB_Report received directly from the constrained descendant.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note, that at this point if agent {a mathematical formula}Ag receives a CPA message the last line of the {a mathematical formula}Local_Cost data structure will contain the sum of its constraints cost with all other agents, for each of its possible value assignment.</a>
