<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}r ∈ grndC ′ ( Π ) and suppose {a mathematical formula}A ⊭ r, i.e., {a mathematical formula}A ⊭ H(r) but {a mathematical formula}A ⊨ B(r).As we have seen in the proof of Theorem 16, all lde-safety relevant positive external atoms in r are represented with degree 0 in the program computed by Algorithm GroundHEXNaive.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As such external atoms are handled equivalently by our optimized algorithm, they are also represented in {a mathematical formula} Π pg.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that this holds also for positive external atoms which are not lde-safety relevant.Suppose r contains an external atom which is not lde-safety relevant and which is not represented in {a mathematical formula} Π pg.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then there is a ‘ first ’ such external atom {a mathematical formula}&g[v](u) in {a mathematical formula}B(r), i.e., its input list only contains constants which (1) appear in ordinary atoms, (2) appear in lde-safety relevant external atoms, or (3) were already constants in the program.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In all three cases, the input auxiliary rule for {a mathematical formula}&g[v](u) is instantiated for this v because its body atoms are potentially true (ordinary atoms appear also in {a mathematical formula}B(r) and are potentially true, otherwise r would not have been added to {a mathematical formula} Π g; external atoms are all not lde-safety relevant and are potentially true since they are represented with degree 0), i.e., {a mathematical formula}ginp&g(v) appears in the program.</a>
