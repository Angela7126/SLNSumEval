<a href="#0" id="0">A qualitative calculus {a mathematical formula}M provides a constraint language by using formulas of the form {a mathematical formula}(vi Α vj), where Α is a relation in {a mathematical formula}M and {a mathematical formula}vi,vj are variables taking values from the universe of {a mathematical formula}M. Formulas of the form {a mathematical formula}(vi Α vj) are called constraints (over {a mathematical formula}M).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If Α is a basic relation in {a mathematical formula}M, {a mathematical formula}(vi Α vj) is called a basic constraint.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Suppose {a mathematical formula}S is a subset of {a mathematical formula}M. The consistency problem cspsat ({a mathematical formula}S) is defined as follows:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a direct consequence, we have Assuming that all landmarks are represented by polygons, then the consistency problem{a mathematical formula}cspsats(BRCC5)is in P, and the consistency problems{a mathematical formula}cspsatf(BRCC5),{a mathematical formula}cspsats(RCC5), and{a mathematical formula}cspsatf(RCC5)are all NP-complete.It follows directly from Theorem 9 that {a mathematical formula}cspsats(BRCC5) is in P. Moreover, by Proposition 1 we know that {a mathematical formula}cspsatf(BRCC5), {a mathematical formula}cspsats(RCC5), and {a mathematical formula}cspsatf(RCC5) are all in NP.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If all {a mathematical formula}S¯i are given in advance as a constraint for spatial variable {a mathematical formula}vi (i.e., we explicitly specify whether vertex {a mathematical formula}e in the overlay is on the boundary of {a mathematical formula}vi for all {a mathematical formula}e and {a mathematical formula}vi), then the existence of such a solution can be determined in polynomial time.</a>
