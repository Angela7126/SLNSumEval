<a href="#0" id="0">They are based on changes of the assertions in the ontology that enable answer sets.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As it turns out, repair answer sets do not have higher complexity than ordinary answer sets (more precisely, weak and flp answer sets) if queries in DL-atoms are evaluable in polynomial time; to ensure this, we concentrate on the prominent Description Logic DL-{a mathematical formula}LiteA from the DL-Lite family [21].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can get to (h) only if {a mathematical formula}I ˆ is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ ; furthermore, by setting {a mathematical formula}SgrI ˆ to {a mathematical formula}Gr(S,I ˆ ,A) in (b) and by the further modifications, it is ensured at (h) that each DL-atom {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Dp has some coherent support set that matches with {a mathematical formula}A ′ (i.e., {a mathematical formula}Gr(S,I ˆ ,A ′ )(a) ≠ ∅ ), while no DL-atom {a mathematical formula}a ′ ∈ Dn has such a support set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus from Proposition 61, it follows that {a mathematical formula}I ˆ is a compatible set for {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T ∪ A ′ ,P 〉 ; hence {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, as {a mathematical formula}flpFND(I ˆ ,T ∪ A ′ ,P) succeeds, I is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ flpI,O.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ , and thus a deletion repair answer set of Π .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(Completeness) Suppose I is a deletion repair answer set.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">That is, for some {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊆ A, we have that I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T ∪ A ′ ,P 〉 .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This implies Proposition 50 that {a mathematical formula}I ˆ is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ and thus will be considered in (b), with {a mathematical formula}Dp and {a mathematical formula}Dn reflecting the (correct) guess for {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ O ′ a for each DL-atom a, where {a mathematical formula}O ′ =T ∪ A ′ .</a>
