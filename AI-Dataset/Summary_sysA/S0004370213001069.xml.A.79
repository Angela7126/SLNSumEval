<a href="#0" id="0">To illustrate the behavior of Algorithm 1 consider the following AF:{a mathematical formula} The AF has two preferred extensions {a mathematical formula}{b,e} and {a mathematical formula}{a,c,e} with e being the only skeptically accepted argument.Let us first test b for skeptical acceptance with Algorithm 1 and base semantics adm. Then, already in line 2 of the algorithm we obtain an admissible set attacking b, e.g.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The procedure follows the idea of the first loop in Algorithm 2, Algorithm 3, and thus in principle can decide the reasoning problems without any further investigations, but would be expensive for high values of k. To profit in cases where k is small from the complexity-sensitive perspective, and avoid unnecessary computational cost otherwise, we include again the parameter d to bound the search-depth to sets of arguments to those whose range S satisfies {a mathematical formula}|A ∖ S| ⩽ d.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The reason for setting the shortcut parameter d to 1 was to allow for semi-stable and stage semantics a fast computation if a stable extension exists ({a mathematical formula}d=0 is sufficient for this) or if a semi-stable or stage extension with a range covering almost all arguments exists.</a>
