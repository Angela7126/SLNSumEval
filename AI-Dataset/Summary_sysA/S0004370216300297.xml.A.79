<a href="#0" id="0">We establish these results by means of program transposition — a novel polynomial transformation in which the rules of a given Disjunctive Datalog program {a mathematical formula}P are inverted by moving all IDB atoms between head and body while at the same time replacing their corresponding predicates with relevant auxiliary predicates of higher arity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our results stem from the correctness of program transposition: a novel polynomial transformation Ξ applicable to an arbitrary Disjunctive Datalog program {a mathematical formula}P in which the rules of {a mathematical formula}P are inverted by moving all IDB atoms from head to body and vice versa while at the same time replacing their corresponding predicates by auxiliary predicates of higher arity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The rest of this section is devoted to showing that {a mathematical formula} Ξ M(P) is indeed a Datalog rewriting of a Disjunctive Datalog program {a mathematical formula}P whenever M is a marking of {a mathematical formula}P. The correctness argument is similar in structure to the proof of Theorem 3 but it is more involved, as it requires a separate treatment for the auxiliary predicates depending on whether or not the relevant base predicate is marked.</a>
