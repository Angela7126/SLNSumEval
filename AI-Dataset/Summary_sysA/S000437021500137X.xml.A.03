<a href="#0" id="0">Item {a mathematical formula}v3 is in a set that includes the second-most sparse items.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This paper deals with the relationships formed by user {a mathematical formula}um, item {a mathematical formula}vn, and tag {a mathematical formula}tk.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}v1 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">SSTF applies biases from semantic classes to item (or tag) feature vectors in tensor factorization to solve the sparsity problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">SSTF creates an augmented tensor by incorporating the relationships composed of {a mathematical formula}u1 (or {a mathematical formula}u2), CV1 (or CV2), and “ Breathless ” into the original tensor.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">SSTF incorporates semantic biases into the tensor factorization by updating the feature vectors for objects using those for classes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">SSTF constructs the i-th augmented tensor {a mathematical formula}Rt(i) in the same way as it creates {a mathematical formula}Rv(i):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}tk is updated in a similar way by incorporating semantic biases into the feature vectors of the sparse tags.In Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, {a mathematical formula} Ε (1) and {a mathematical formula} Ε (2) are set to zero.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The size of the user – item – tag tensor is {a mathematical formula}2026×5088×9160.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The size of the user – item – tag tensor was {a mathematical formula}36,472×4503×4990.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The size of the user – item – tag tensor was {a mathematical formula}1824×6854×8922.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This indicates that performance can be improved by setting {a mathematical formula} Ε (i) for item classes and {a mathematical formula} Ε (i) for tag classes independently.</a>
