<a href="#1" id="1">As shown below, the only important feature to have to make a correspondence between a FA and the fact that ∘ satisfies the weakened AGM Postulates is that there is a minimal model for {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T in {a mathematical formula}Mod(T ′ ) as expressed by Theorem 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A formula relaxation based on Ρ , denoted {a mathematical formula} Ρ F Ρ is defined as follows, for any two complex concepts C and D, any individuals {a mathematical formula}a,b, and any role r:{a mathematical formula} Note that the relaxation of the role assertion axiom amounts to delete it from the knowledge base, since a tautology is satisfied by any model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For every knowledge base T, let us define the binary relation {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T ⊆ Mod×Mod by: for all {a mathematical formula}M,M ′ ∈ Mod,{a mathematical formula}Let us first show that {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T satisfies the two conditions of FA.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let us now suppose that for a revision operation ∘ there exists a FA which maps any knowledge base {a mathematical formula}T ⊆ Sen to a binary relation {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T ⊆ Mod×Mod satisfying the three conditions of Theorem 1.</a>
