<a href="#0" id="0">The approach described in this section shows how as a Lakatos Game is executed, AIF structures are created which, when translated to {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+, produce abstract argumentation frameworks which under grounded semantics have as acceptable arguments all and only those elements which correspond to the mathematical theory accepted by the participants at a given stage of the game.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">With this argument out, if there are no other pending counterexamples (and the dialogue protocol constrains the discussion to handle just one at a time), the conjecture will be in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, MonsterBar(m, c, r) updates {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {(r, Α )} where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For MonsterAdjust, a direct counter, r, to the counterexample m, is introduced along with the symmetrical conflict between them, but also a preference to ensure r defeats m. For {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+, this means that {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {r}, {a mathematical formula}m ‾ ′ =m ‾ ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}r ‾ ′ =r ‾ ∖ {m} (this latter is the result of the AIF PA node).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As with MonsterBar-ing, if there are no other pending counterexamples (and the dialogue protocol constrains the discussion to handle just one at a time), the conjecture will be in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, for MonsterAdjust(m, r), the associated update is {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {(r,m),(r, Α )}, where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c].</a>
