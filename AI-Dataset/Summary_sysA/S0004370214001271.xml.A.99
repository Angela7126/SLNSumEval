<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}M ⁎ will be shown to be equivalent to alternating between running {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ on a search graph, and expanding the search graph based on collisions found by {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a result, demonstrating that the construction of the search graph takes finite time and that the search graph will eventually contain the optimal path, if extant, is sufficient to prove that {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ is complete and optimal.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Recall that {a mathematical formula}rM ⁎ uses {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ as the underlying planning algorithm, so that {a mathematical formula}rM ⁎ typically expands more vertices than {a mathematical formula}ODrM ⁎ or {a mathematical formula}EPErM ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, we expected {a mathematical formula}ODrM ⁎ to solve more instances within the given time limit.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}ODrM ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}EPErM ⁎ solved twice as many problems involving 25 robots as basic {a mathematical formula}rM ⁎ .</a>
