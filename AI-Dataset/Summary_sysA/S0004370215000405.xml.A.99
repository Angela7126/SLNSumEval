<a href="#0" id="0">This definition implicitly models a strategy as a function {a mathematical formula}f: Ω P → R|Xc| that maps each situation Ω in a schedule for the controllable time points that fulfills the constraints of the projection {a mathematical formula}P Ω .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Definition 6 we modeled a weak strategy as a single function {a mathematical formula}f:R|Yu| → R|Xc|, but we can equivalently consider a set of functions {a mathematical formula}f1, … ,f|Xc| each computing a schedule for a single controllable time point given the situation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A linear strategy is such that the value of every controllable time point is obtained as a linear combination of {a mathematical formula}Y → u.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}n ≐ |Xc| and {a mathematical formula}m ≐ |Xu|.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A linear strategy can be represented with a matrix A of real coefficients of size {a mathematical formula}n×m and a vector {a mathematical formula}c → of size n. Every controllable variable is scheduled according to a linear function of the uncontrollable durations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By combining these linear strategies for all the faces of the polyhedron we obtain a weak strategy for P.Without loss of generality we can assume {a mathematical formula} Ψ (X → c,Y → u) being a bounded set (meaning that it can be completely contained in a ball of finite radius).</a>
