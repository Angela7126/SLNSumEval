<a href="#0" id="0">The performance of the {a mathematical formula}ToM3 agent and the {a mathematical formula}ToM4 agent suggests that there may be a limit to the effectiveness of application of higher orders of theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, since rock – paper – scissors involves three possible opponent actions, the game leaves room for only three unique predictions of the opponent ʼ s next action.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">8a shows, these two distinct types of behaviour make it more difficult for the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent to accurately model his opponent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the present model, a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent that has a learning speed {a mathematical formula} Λ i<1 believes that his opponent has the same learning speed.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As a result, he believes that there is a single action that maximizes the opponent ʼ s expected payoff.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, when his opponent has the maximal learning speed {a mathematical formula} Λ j=1, she actually randomizes her choice over two possible actions.</a>
