<a href="#0" id="0">Exploiting global features (F-IDF strategy) There is still a non-negligible fraction of Wikipedia WEE pages which, however, are as yet in their early stage of development, and thus suffer from lack of content.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, more than 30% of Italian WEE pages lack a Wikipedia category, and 25% of these do not even have a definition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that the first strategy above cannot be applied to this class of pages, since there is no English equivalent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The TT and SISTER strategies are, instead, applicable: however, the former is effective only when some translation (provided by the TT) is contained in the textual definition of the target page {a mathematical formula}pF, while the latter is applicable only on those pages which have categories related to the hypernym lemma to be discovered, i.e., such that they bring in sister pages with a valid hypernym lemma.</a>
