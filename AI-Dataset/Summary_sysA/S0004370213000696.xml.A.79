That is, the initial pull of Arm2 in S does not follow {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ .The underlying idea is that the sequence T should start with the teacher pulling {a mathematical formula}Arm ⁎ repeatedly, and tracking the values obtained by the learner to see if it can ever discern what the sequence S would have looked like after some number of rounds (it simulates sequence S).</a>
