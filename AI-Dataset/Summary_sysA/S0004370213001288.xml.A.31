<a href="#1" id="1">The following holds for swoon-SP elections.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For each t, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that given an instance of CCDV for t-approval elections finds a number s such that the minimal number of voters that we have to delete from our input election in order to ensure the preferred candidate Ê¼ s victory is between{a mathematical formula}12sand s.Let {a mathematical formula}E=(C,V) be our input election and let L be our given societal axis with respect to which E is a swoon-SP election.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let p be our preferred candidate.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our algorithm proceeds as follows:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The crucial observation here is that the proof of the CCDC case of Theorem 6.4 ensures that deleting candidates outside of the set A is never a successful strategy.</a>
