<a href="#0" id="0">The SCP sampling procedure is the same as CDP's, but with the following difference: we perform a goal test on each node s sampled.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">SCP predicts i to be the optimal solution cost of start state {a mathematical formula}s ⁎ with i being the first level in which the probability of a goal type existing exceeded a threshold value c set by the user.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Algorithm 2 describes the overall BiSS algorithm, which receives a start state {a mathematical formula}s ⁎ , a goal state g, a number of probes p, a Γ value for determining when the forward and the backward frontiers match, and a type system T. BiSS returns an estimated cost c of the optimal path from {a mathematical formula}s ⁎ to g.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Intuitively, a single probe of BiSS is able to produce a perfect prediction of the optimal solution cost when using a type system that has goal types and obeys Equation (1) for all nodes s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ of the same type, and when {a mathematical formula} Γ =1.0.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is because a single probe of BiSS's forward and backward searches would encounter exactly the set of types in BFSF and BFSB.</a>
