<a href="#0" id="0">We give the general definition of TET semantics in two steps: first we define the value space of nested counts associated with a given TET {a mathematical formula}T(V), and then the actual mapping {a mathematical formula}a ↦ V(T(a)).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Relevant in the current context is the fact that the distribution is defined as a function of count features, which, adapting the notation of the previous example, can be written in the form{a mathematical formula} where now {a mathematical formula} Φ (X) can be any first-order formula with free variables X.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The discriminant function used by the learner (as well as virtually any other conceivable prediction model) is not able to exactly map the feature value obtained from the first branch into the binary threshold function {a mathematical formula}h>7, and therefore additional features represented by the additional branches can still be useful for obtaining a better fit to this threshold.</a>
