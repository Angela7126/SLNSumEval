<a href="#0" id="0">Proof</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Also, the following theorem holds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">PLDA-RQ always produces a feasible and fair matching.Assume {a mathematical formula}X ′ , which is the matching obtained by PLDA-RQ, is not feasible.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By the definition of the generalized DA mechanism, {a mathematical formula}X ′ is semi-school-feasible.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, the only possibility that {a mathematical formula}X ′ is not feasible is that some student s is not assigned to any school.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since {a mathematical formula}X ′ is semi-school-feasible, we can choose contract {a mathematical formula}x=(s,c) such that {a mathematical formula}X ′ ∪ {x} is semi-school-feasible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, it is clear that {a mathematical formula}x ∈ ChS(X ′ ∪ {x}) and {a mathematical formula}x ∈ ChC(X ′ ∪ {x}) hold.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This contradicts the fact that {a mathematical formula}X ′ is HM-stable.Assume {a mathematical formula}X ′ is not fair.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Then, there exist {a mathematical formula}(s,c),(s ′ ,c ′ ) ∈ X ′ , such that {a mathematical formula}c ′ ≻ sc and {a mathematical formula}s ≻ c ′ s ′ hold.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Since we assume {a mathematical formula} ≻ PL respects {a mathematical formula} ≻ c ′ , {a mathematical formula}(s,c ′ ) ≻ PL(s ′ ,c ′ ) holds.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then, it is clear that {a mathematical formula}(s,c ′ ) ∈ ChS(X ′ ∪ {(s,c ′ )}) and {a mathematical formula}(s,c ′ ) ∈ ChC(X ′ ∪ {(s,c ′ )}) hold.</a>
