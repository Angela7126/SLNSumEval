<a href="#0" id="0">By Theorem 1, any sequence of IR deals must converge to an efficient state, independently from the specific payment scheme in use.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we are using the Knaster payment scheme, any state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) reached during negotiation will satisfy {a mathematical formula} Π (i)=exi(A) − Ex(A)/n for each agent i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, we are bound to converge to a state {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ) with an efficient allocation {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ where {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (i)=exi(A ⁎ ) − Ex(A ⁎ )/n.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Take {a mathematical formula}v1 to be any non-supermodular valuation function defined over two goods {a mathematical formula}g1 and {a mathematical formula}g2; that is{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}d>0.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Now we construct a second valuation function {a mathematical formula}v2, which will be modular (so it certainly also will be supermodular), as follows:{a mathematical formula} But now, in a scenario with two agents with these two valuation functions, the (only) efficient allocation is to give good {a mathematical formula}g1 to agent 1 and good {a mathematical formula}g2 to agent 2, yielding a social welfare of {a mathematical formula}v1({g1})+v1({g2}) − d/3.</a>
