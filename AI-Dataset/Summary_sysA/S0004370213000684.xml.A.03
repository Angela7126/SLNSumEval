<a href="#0" id="0">Empirical results show that arc-gv probably generates a larger minimum margin but with higher generalization error, and Breiman ʼ s minimum bound is {a mathematical formula}O(lnm/m), sharper than {a mathematical formula}O(lnm/m) in Theorem 1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is straightforward to get a result similar to Breiman ʼ s minimum margin bound in Theorem 2, by setting {a mathematical formula}k=1 in Eq.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">(10), we can see clearly that the bound of Theorem 8 is {a mathematical formula}O(lnm/m), sharper than the bound of Schapire et al.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For {a mathematical formula} Α >0, the Chernoff ʼ s bound in Lemma 1 gives{a mathematical formula} For any {a mathematical formula} Ε N>0, we consider the following probability:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}y ˆ kg(x ˆ k) denotes the kth margin with respect to g. For any k, Eq.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For any {a mathematical formula} Δ >0, the following holds with probability at least {a mathematical formula}1 − Δ from Eq.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">(15),{a mathematical formula} which completes the proof of Eq.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Similarly to the proof of Theorem 4, we have{a mathematical formula} for any given {a mathematical formula} Α >0, {a mathematical formula}f ∈ C(H) and {a mathematical formula}g ∈ CN(H) drawn i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, for any {a mathematical formula} Δ N>0, combining union bound with Eq.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If {a mathematical formula}m ⩾ 5, then we have{a mathematical formula} Therefore, the following holds by combining Eq.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Similarly to the proof of Theorem 4, we have{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ A, {a mathematical formula}f ∈ C(H) and {a mathematical formula}g ∈ CN(H) chosen i.i.d.</a>
