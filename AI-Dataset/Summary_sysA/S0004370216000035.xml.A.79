<a href="#0" id="0">Section 4 develops query complexity results for certain forms of monotone predicates; it is shown that minimal sets for these predicates can be computed with a logarithmic number of calls to an NP oracle that provides a witness (the class {a mathematical formula}FPNP[wit,log]).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This section extends the results of Section 4 to the case when it is known that there are exactly k minimal sets, for some constant k. Given the results of previous sections, form {a mathematical formula}P is the only predicate form of interest, since function problems represented with predicates of either form {a mathematical formula}L or {a mathematical formula}B can be solved with a logarithmic number of witness oracle calls (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Proposition 7 lets us derive that a minimal set for a predicate of the form {a mathematical formula}P can be computed if the number of minimal set is bounded.</a>
