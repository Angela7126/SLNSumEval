<a href="#0" id="0">Several interesting findings have been revealed through our experiments: 1) FISH2 is not suitable for static tasks, because it forces to take into account the time factor whether or not concept drift occurs; 2) When sudden concept drift occurs, a certain degree of redundancy removal can help the learner to adapt more quickly to a novel concept; 3) Before concept drift can be detected, our proposed NEFCS-SRR tries to preserve previously learnt concepts; therefore compared to sudden concept drift it is believed to be more suitable for gradual concept drift; 4) In the spam filtering domain, where the problem space is very sparse, a competence-based instance selection technique has a clear advantage over other instance selection techniques; 5) Although each method behaves very differently based on the dataset, our proposed NEFCS-SRR approach constantly reports good overall accuracy across the datasets compared, and we therefore believe it is more general than the other methods compared; 6) Finally, in term of efficiency, all competence-based methods require extra time for maintaining the competence models; this makes a competence-based method inappropriate for applications that require real time decisions, such as network intrusion detection where an extremely high volume of packages arrives every second.</a>
