<a href="#0" id="0">We benchmark our semantic similarity procedure on the word similarity task.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Word similarity is a specific task from semantic similarity in which we measure how semantically close two words are.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to be able to compute the similarity between words we first need to map the two words to their corresponding synsets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, this mapping is a straightforward process, thanks to the multilingual sense inventory of BabelNet.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As frequently done in this task, we measure the similarity between two words w and {a mathematical formula}w ′ as the similarity between their closest senses [115], [13], [106], [17]:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Lw represents the set of synsets which contain w as one of its lexicalizations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As vector comparison VC we use WO (see Section 3.5) to compare lexical and unified representations, and cosine for the embedded representations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that, thanks to our unified representation, w and {a mathematical formula}w ′ may belong to different languages.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Throughout this section on the tasks based on semantic similarity, Nasarilexical and Nasariunified represent the systems based on the lexical and unified vectors, respectively.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We refer to the combination of both lexical and unified vectors as Nasari.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This combination is based on the average similarity scores given by lexical and unified vectors for each sense pair.</a>
