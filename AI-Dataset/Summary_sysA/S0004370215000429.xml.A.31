<a href="#0" id="0">The status of the Erd Ő s discrepancy conjecture for {a mathematical formula}C=2 has been settled by the authors of this article [30], [31] by encoding the problem as a propositional satisfiability problem and using state of the art SAT solvers to prove that the longest ±1 sequence of discrepancy 2 contains 1160 elements.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A {a mathematical formula}13900 long ±1 sequence of discrepancy 3 was also constructed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then the discrepancy of a finite ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn of length n is a minimal C such that for every {a mathematical formula}d:1 ≤ d ≤ ⌊ nC+1 ⌋ the subsequence {a mathematical formula}xd,x2d … ,x ⌊ n/d ⌋ ⋅ d is C-bounded.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For an infinite sequence {a mathematical formula}(xn) its discrepancy is the supremum of discrepancies of all its initial finite fragments.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally notice that the fact that {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn is multiplicative does not imply that {a mathematical formula} − x1, … , − xn is, so symmetry breaking described in Proposition 11 is not applicable for multiplicative and completely multiplicative sequences.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Theorem 15</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">So we get a computer-aided proof of another sharp bound on the sizes of maximal sequences of bounded discrepancy.</a>
