<a href="#0" id="0">The approach brings together two main advantages: (1) it provides a unified representation for all linguistic items, enabling the meaningful comparison of arbitrary items, irrespective of their scales or the linguistic levels they belong to (e.g., the phrase take a walk to the verb stroll); (2) it disambiguates linguistic items to a set of intended concepts prior to modeling and, hence, it is able to identify the semantic similarities that exist at the deepest sense level, independently of the text's surface forms or any semantic ambiguity therein.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our technique models arbitrary linguistic items through a unified representation, called semantic signature, which is a probability distribution over concepts, word senses, or words in a lexicon.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From the above examples we observe that the same task of semantic similarity involves an inherently different focus as we move from one linguistic level to another: the similarity for the case of senses and words is characterized by the direct similarity of the concepts they surrogate, while for larger textual items similarity denotes the amount of overlapping information between the two items.</a>
