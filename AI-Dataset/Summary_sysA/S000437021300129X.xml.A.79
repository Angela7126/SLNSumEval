<a href="#0" id="0">It can be generated from its epistemic skeleton by updating with the public protocol {a mathematical formula}?p ⋅ b+?¬p ⋅ a or with the epistemic protocol model:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Actually, on arbitrary epistemic models, the announcement of {a mathematical formula}?p ⋅ b+?¬p ⋅ a will always yield the same result as the above epistemic protocol model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the other hand, the announcement {a mathematical formula}?p ⋅ (a+b) gives a different update result on the same epistemic model compared to the update with the following epistemic protocol:{a mathematical formula} Such examples suggest a notion of equivalence between protocol models.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Now we can verify the following:{a mathematical formula} Formally, one needs first to convert {a mathematical formula} Η 1 with respect to {a mathematical formula}FLB into the corresponding normal form using the guarded automata construction of Proposition 41, and then construct the epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}M ⊗ Η 1FLB according to Definition 42, and finally check the truth value of the remaining {a mathematical formula}[! Η 1FLB]-free formula on this model.</a>
