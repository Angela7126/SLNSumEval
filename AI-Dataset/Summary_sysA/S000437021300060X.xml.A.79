<a href="#0" id="0">This allows us to show, for instance, that System {a mathematical formula}A is sound and complete for the inference of arbitrary CI statements from sets of saturated CI statements relative to both the class of all binary probability measures and the class of all discrete probability measures.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These results yield a normal form for derivations under System {a mathematical formula}A: first, from the given set of CI statements, derive a set of elementary CI statements from the given set of CI statements under System {a mathematical formula}G; then, from this set, derive a new set of elementary CI statements under System {a mathematical formula}E; and, finally, from this last set, derive the targeted CI statement under inference System {a mathematical formula}G. (Notice that System {a mathematical formula}E can be inferred from System {a mathematical formula}A.)</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Definition 23, Definition 27 for soundness and completeness of an inference system for the additive implication problem {a mathematical formula}(C1,C2)F ({a mathematical formula}C1 and {a mathematical formula}C2 are classes of CI statements and {a mathematical formula}F is a class of real-valued functions) can be adapted to the setting of probabilistic implication, provided {a mathematical formula}F is replaced by a class of discrete probability measures {a mathematical formula}P, and a-implication ({a mathematical formula} ⊨ a) is replaced by m-implication ({a mathematical formula} ⊨ m).</a>
