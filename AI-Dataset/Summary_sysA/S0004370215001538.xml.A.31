<a href="#0" id="0">Apart from possibly being useful as benchmarks, these models are usually proposed as tools to improve our understanding of intelligence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, the third question (Q3) is: Are computer models for solving intelligence test problems useful for understanding human cognition?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We want to know whether these tasks are good for cognitive modelling and to ascertain what constructs and cognitive mechanisms are needed to solve these problems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is also crucial to see why and how humans solve (some of) them.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to answer this question, we will require several criteria, mostly ‘ intention ’ , ‘ range ’ , and ‘ performance ’ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Basically, this question is about the implications for cognitive science.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We need to be clear that focussing on the overall results of a computer model and comparing them with the results of humans (column ‘ performance ’ on Table 4) is not very informative about how challenging the problem is (question Q2).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First, humans are general-purpose systems and it is not fair to compare them with some systems that are only able to solve one problem — even if the problem comes from an intelligence test.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Second, many of these intelligence test problems have been developed for humans, and hence it can be unfair to evaluate AI systems limitations with anthropocentric measures.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Third, some of the works perform an interesting analysis in terms of difficulty (column ‘ difficulty ’ on Table 4).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The purpose is to determine what instances are more difficult, but this is not very related to how challenging the problem is.</a>
