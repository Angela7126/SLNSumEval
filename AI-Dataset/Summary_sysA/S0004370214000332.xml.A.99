<a href="#0" id="0">Interestingly, in CPD, the admissible heuristic used in the DEE/{a mathematical formula}A ⁎ algorithm at depth d of the search tree is [33]:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From a WCSP perspective, interpreting energies as cost functions, this heuristic is exactly the PFC-DAC lower bound [85], [56] used in WCSP.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These values correspond to forbidden assignments because the sum of the corresponding binary term plus the two unary costs plus the current lower bound {a mathematical formula}E ∅ (produced by soft arc consistency) is greater than or equal to the current upper bound k. Such values s do not need to be considered by the min operation because {a mathematical formula}{ir,js} does not belong to any optimal solution, whereas {a mathematical formula}{iu,js} may.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Worst-cost differences are computed by the function {a mathematical formula}getDifference(j,i,u,r) applied to every binary cost function related to i, discarding forbidden assignments with {a mathematical formula}{ir,js} (line 8), as suggested by Eq.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to reduce the time (and space) complexity of pruning by dominance, we test only one pair of values per variable.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence the name, {a mathematical formula}DEE1, for the new algorithm described in Algorithm 2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To capture the fact that there is at most one value selected per domain, we penalize the simultaneous selection of every pair {a mathematical formula}ir,is of rotamers of the same variable i with a sufficiently large penalty M. To guarantee that at least one value will be selected in each domain, we shift all finite energies by a constant negative term N such that all shifted finite energies are strictly negative.</a>
