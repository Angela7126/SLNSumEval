<a href="#0" id="0">Simply enough, in the progressional definition, a first-order structure {a mathematical formula}M is a stable model of a first-order normal logic program Π if and only if it is the fixed point of the progression of Π with respect to {a mathematical formula}M. More precisely, {a mathematical formula}M coincides with the structure obtained by recursively applying the rules in Π , where the negative parts are fixed by {a mathematical formula}M itself.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show that, for normal logic programs, this progressional definition is equivalent to the general stable model semantics defined by {a mathematical formula}SM( Π ).</a>
