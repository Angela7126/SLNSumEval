<a href="#0" id="0">It is straightforward to get a result similar to Breiman ʼ s minimum margin bound in Theorem 2, by setting {a mathematical formula}k=1 in Eq.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is noteworthy that Theorem 8 shows that the generalization error can be bounded in term of the empirical margin distribution {a mathematical formula}PrS[yf(x) ⩽ Θ ], the training sample size and the hypothesis complexity; in other words, this bound considers exactly the same factors as Schapire et al.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This corollary shows that the bounds of Theorem 9 are {a mathematical formula}O(lnm/m), comparable to the Emargin bounds [44] and the bounds of Theorem 8, but with different constants.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For {a mathematical formula}Xi ∈ [0,1] and {a mathematical formula} Ξ m(X¯k,Y), it is easy to obtain the optimal solution by simple calculation{a mathematical formula} which yields that{a mathematical formula} For {a mathematical formula}Xi ∈ [0,1], it is obvious that{a mathematical formula} and from Lemma 7, we have{a mathematical formula} which yields that, for {a mathematical formula}m ⩾ 5,{a mathematical formula} Therefore, for any {a mathematical formula}t>0, the following holds by using Lemma 6 to {a mathematical formula} Ξ m(X¯),{a mathematical formula} Setting {a mathematical formula} Δ =exp( − mt2/2E[V ˆ m(X¯)]) gives{a mathematical formula} which completes the proof of Eq.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">(8) in Theorem 3 guarantees that the following holds with probability at least {a mathematical formula}1 − Δ N over sample S, for any {a mathematical formula}g ∈ CN(H) and {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ A,{a mathematical formula} where{a mathematical formula} Furthermore, we have{a mathematical formula} which yields that{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}m ⩾ 5.</a>
