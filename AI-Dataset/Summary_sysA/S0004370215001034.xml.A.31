<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}C1, … ,Cm be disjoint categories and let {a mathematical formula}Oi be a set of entities that are known to belong to category {a mathematical formula}Ci (i.e.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}O= ⋃ iOi is the available training data).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We consider the problem of deciding which category is most likely to contain an unlabelled entity x.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this context, using similarity based reasoning corresponds to k-NN classification [20], i.e.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">we use {a mathematical formula}S to find the k entities {a mathematical formula}y1, … ,yk from O which are most similar to x and then assign x to the category to which most of the entities {a mathematical formula}yi belong.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We now discuss a number of classifiers which are based on other commonsense reasoning patterns.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The results are summarized in Table 16.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We have not considered the betweenness and analogical classifiers here, as they do not scale to the 15000 movies in {a mathematical formula}Emovie, due to their quadratic time complexity.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Again we find that the results are not very sensitive to the chosen number of dimensions.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In contrast to the results for place types, here the SVM classifiers achieve the best performance, followed by the FOIL based methods.</a>
