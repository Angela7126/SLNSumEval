<a href="#0" id="0">However condition 2 also implies that any interpretation that satisfies the Standard Names Assumption is a Herbrand interpretation for {a mathematical formula}L. As will be discussed below, this assumption will support the logic programming semantics that will be used for rules.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To this end we extend the function Κ (introduced in Definition 5 to translate an ontology to a first-order theory) to translate any MKNF knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K to an MKNF theory {a mathematical formula} Κ (K).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Fact update:Finally, since DMKBs consisting of a sequence of consistent sets of facts are classified by Definition 61 as both ontology- and rule-based, their semantics is given both by ⋄ and by {a mathematical formula}S. This ambivalence is unavoidable if we want to allow both an ontology and a rule layer to contain only facts, or simply to be empty.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Language conservation is an immediate consequence of the definition of the {a mathematical formula}RD-semantics and of basic properties of the least model of a definite program.As for fact update, let {a mathematical formula}P= 〈 Pi 〉 i<n be a sequence of consistent sets of facts.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Language conservation follows by induction on i from Proposition 69 and Lemma 146.As for fact update, let {a mathematical formula}T= 〈 Ti 〉 i<n be a finite sequence of consistent sets of ground objective literals.</a>
