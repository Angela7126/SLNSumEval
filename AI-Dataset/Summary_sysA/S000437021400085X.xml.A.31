<a href="#0" id="0">Once vendors select strategies (prices) P, suppose that the realized buyer types are given by V. This results in the buyer partition {a mathematical formula}S=S(P,V).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We define the regret{a mathematical formula}Regj(P,V) of vendor j relative to this outcome to be the difference between the maximum utility it could have achieved by choosing different prices given this type realization (taking other vendor strategies to be fixed) and its utility given its selected strategy:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}P ′ =(pj ′ ,p − j).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To illustrate, consider a game with two vendors (with zero costs), and two buyers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Buyer a has preferences {a mathematical formula}va=(3,1) (i.e., a prefers vendor 1), whereas {a mathematical formula}vb=(1,3).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The fixed profile {a mathematical formula}P=(3,3) (i.e., {a mathematical formula}p1=3,p2=3) is an FSPE.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">Any {a mathematical formula}pi ′ >3 will result in a utility of 0, whereas setting the price low enough to attract both buyers will result in a utility of at most 2.</a>
