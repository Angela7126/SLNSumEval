<a href="#0" id="0">We provide theoretical conditions under which these formulations produce correct beliefs, and we provide examples to show when they may fail to do so.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our definition of correctness is with respect to the type distribution ϒ : beliefs are said to be correct if they assign the same probabilities to true types as ϒ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This requires that the beliefs can point to the types in the support of the type distribution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, the results in this section pertain to a situation in which the user knows that the true type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ must be a subset of the hypothesised type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this regard, we note that any combination of beliefs Pr and types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ can be described as a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j ⁎ of the form{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This combination is equivalent to sampling a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j ⁎ using probabilities {a mathematical formula}Pr( Θ j ⁎ |Ht), and then using {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ to choose actions {a mathematical formula}aj ∈ Aj via {a mathematical formula} Π j(Ht,aj, Θ j ⁎ )[68].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Analogously, we may combine the true types {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ⊂ Θ j of player j, using the type distribution ϒ , into a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j+ such that{a mathematical formula}</a>
