<a href="#0" id="0">A possibility result establishes that every aggregation rule belonging to a certain class of rules (typically defined in terms of certain axioms) is collectively rational with respect to all graph properties that satisfy a certain meta-property.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An impossibility result, on the other hand, establishes that it is impossible to define an aggregation rule belonging to a certain class that would be collectively rational with respect to any graph property that meets a certain meta-property — or that the only such aggregation rules would be clearly very unattractive for other reasons.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The first such axiom is an independence condition that requires that the decision of whether or not a given edge e should be part of the collective graph should only depend on which of the individual graphs include e. This corresponds to well-known axioms in preference and judgment aggregation [5], [17].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, Example 14 can be used to show the strict implication in item (ii), since it concerns an aggregation rule that is frame collectively rational with respect to modal formula {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p but not model collectively rational with respect to the same formula.</a>
