<a href="#0" id="0">The actual value of ACO2 does not influence the most probable value of the observable variables in the network, i.e., {a mathematical formula}argmaxhPr(h,e,i,ACO2=high)=argmaxhPr(h,e,i,ACO2=mid)=argmaxhPr(h,e,i,ACO2=low) for every joint value assignment i to the intermediate variables other than ACO2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Instance: A Bayesian network {a mathematical formula}B, partitioned into a set of observed evidence variables E, a set of explanation variables H, a set of ‘ relevant ’ intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I+ that are marginalized over, and a set of ‘ irrelevant ’ intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I − that are not marginalized over.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As computing the relevance of a variable I is {a mathematical formula}NP-hard, i.e., intractable in general (see Appendix A for a formal proof), we introduce the notion estimated relevance of I as a subjective assessment of {a mathematical formula}R(I) which may or may not correspond to the actual value.</a>
