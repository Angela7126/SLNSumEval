<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we present a new case-base editing technique which takes both competence enhancement and competence preservation into consideration.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The conditional BBNR rule imposes an additional condition on BBNR rule [5], i.e., any new case c will only be considered as noise and removed by the BBNR rule if c lies outside an identified concept drift competence area (does not represent a new concept).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is one of the reported strengths of the competence-based change detection method that it is able to identify small competence regions where concepts drift most severely.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When working with other change detection methods which have no capacity to locate concept drifts, all new cases will be exempt from removal, which is also the case when {a mathematical formula}p=0 in Definition 8.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Case {a mathematical formula}c ′ ∈ CB is defined as a conflicting case by a new case c which is not in ℵ , if {a mathematical formula}c ∈ LiabilitySet(c ′ ).</a>
