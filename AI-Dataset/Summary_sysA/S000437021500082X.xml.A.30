<a href="#0" id="0">This paper investigates the strengths of a transfer learning meta-algorithm, called L3, that provides a framework that allows the implementation of different algorithms using heuristics to accelerate a Reinforcement Learning procedure in one domain (target), that are obtained from another, simpler, domain (source).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The L3 meta-algorithm works in 3 stages: first, it uses an RL algorithm to learn how to perform one task, storing the solution for this problem as a case in a case base; in the second stage, it maps actions of the source domain to actions of the target domain; and, in the last stage, it uses the stored cases as heuristics to speed up the Reinforcement Learning process in the target domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By using a case base as part of the transfer learning procedure, L3 falls within the class of case-based transfer learning algorithms, discussed in [12].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The case base used in L3-SARSA( Î› ) was the one that contains N cases selected by random sampling the state set and finding the best action for that state, because this is the case base that produced the best results for the transfer.</a>
