<a href="#1" id="1">both s and{a mathematical formula}s ′ satisfy the static causal rules in S (Property 1),</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Notice that a mapping Ξ from causal action theories to logic programs yields a semantic function Δ under (1) and (2): {a mathematical formula}(s,s ′ ) ∈ Δ (T) iff there is an answer set A of {a mathematical formula} Ξ (T) such that (1) and (2) hold.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">So in the following, when we say that a mapping satisfies a property, we mean that the semantic function yielded by the mapping satisfies this property.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our first result shows the correspondence between action language {a mathematical formula}B and permissible mappings that satisfy Property 1, Property 3, Property 4.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the last section, we described a translation from our causal action theories to causal theories in action language {a mathematical formula}B.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given a causal action theory T, let {a mathematical formula}TB denote the causal theory in {a mathematical formula}B according to this translation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We say that {a mathematical formula}(s,s ′ ) is a transition of T under action language {a mathematical formula}B semantics if {a mathematical formula}(s,A,s ′ ) is a transition of {a mathematical formula}TB according to the semantics of action language {a mathematical formula}B.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let{a mathematical formula} Ξ Bbe the following mapping from causal action theories to logic programs: for each{a mathematical formula}T=(S,D),{a mathematical formula}where</a>
