<a href="#0" id="0">The heuristic used depends on the state of the distributed heuristic {a mathematical formula}hDi estimator, represented in the algorithms as a boolean variable {a mathematical formula}busyDi.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The variable is set by the heuristic estimator to {a mathematical formula}true if it is currently evaluating a state and {a mathematical formula}false if not.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If {a mathematical formula}busyDi=false, the state is evaluated by {a mathematical formula}hDi.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If {a mathematical formula}busyDi=true, the state is evaluated by {a mathematical formula}hLi, that is the distributed heuristic is preferred if possible.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This approach is most reasonable if {a mathematical formula}hDi dominates {a mathematical formula}hLi for most states, which is typically the case for a projected and distributed variant of the same heuristic such as FF.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As the MADLA Search is running in a single process (except for the communication) for each agent, the local heuristic search is performed only when the distributed heuristic search is waiting for the distributed heuristic estimation to finish.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To talk about the actual algorithm formally, we first need to distinguish the state {a mathematical formula}s ⊆ P and its representation in the search algorithm.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note, that due to privacy concerns (as explained later), each agent must have its own set of search nodes with its own representation of the actual state.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If node u was expanded by a public action, a message {a mathematical formula}MSTATE is sent to all other agents, containing the public projection {a mathematical formula}s ▷ pub of state s together with the private unique identifiers representing the private parts of all agents, its {a mathematical formula}u.g, its heuristic value {a mathematical formula}u.h and a parameter d determining whether it was evaluated using the local or distributed heuristic in order to determine to which open list it should be added.</a>
