<a href="#0" id="0">To investigate how robust our ICP matching step is with respect to such differences between CAD model and actual object, we conducted an experiment where we matched several CAD models of chairs against recorded point data of a chair.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A photograph of the chair and a view of the resulting point cloud can be seen in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The results clearly indicate that as long as the CAD model is “ similar enough ” (chairs 1 – 4) to the objects found in the data, our system works.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The results for chairs 2 – 4 were even slightly better than for chair 1, which we considered the best fit for the actual object and which is used in the subsequent experiments.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have presented a semantic mapping system that creates a triangle mesh of an office environment, detects several classes of furniture, and replaces them by their corresponding CAD models, based on Kinect point cloud data captured using a mobile robot.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The system was evaluated both on single frames and fully registered scenes of two datasets containing 810 single point clouds.</a>
