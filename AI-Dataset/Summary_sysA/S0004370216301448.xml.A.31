<a href="#0" id="0">Neighbors refinement assumes as input a set {a mathematical formula}S ˆ of dead-end states that satisfies the {a mathematical formula}uC-recognized neighbors property.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Namely, we denote by {a mathematical formula}T ˆ the neighbors of {a mathematical formula}S ˆ , i.e., the set of states {a mathematical formula}t ∉ S ˆ where there exists {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S ˆ s.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}s → t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The {a mathematical formula}uC-recognized neighbors property requires that {a mathematical formula}uC(t)= ∞ for all {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T ˆ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the context of Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2, we set {a mathematical formula}S ˆ :={s ′ |s ′ ∈ R[s],uC(s ′ )=0}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Provided that {a mathematical formula}uC is the only dead-end detector used, it is easy to see that the {a mathematical formula}uC-recognized neighbors property always holds at the refinement step on {a mathematical formula}R[s]: {a mathematical formula}R[s] contains only closed states, so it contains all states {a mathematical formula}s ′ reachable from s, up to the neighbor states {a mathematical formula}t ∈ R[s] ∖ S ˆ where {a mathematical formula}uC(t)= ∞ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also run offline learning variants, for proving unsolvability and for dead-end detection.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In either case, we use path-cut refinement and conflict refinement, as neighbors refinement is not applicable in the offline context.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For proving unsolvability, we simply refine {a mathematical formula}uC on the initial state until {a mathematical formula}uC(I)= ∞ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For dead-end detection, we refine {a mathematical formula}uC on the initial state until a size bound N is reached.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then we use the same set C for {a mathematical formula}uC dead-end detection throughout the search.</a>
