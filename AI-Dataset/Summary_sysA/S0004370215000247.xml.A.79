<a href="#0" id="0">The basic idea behind this technique includes an initial state description, a task network as an objective to be achieved, and domain knowledge consisting of networks of primitive and compound tasks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The criterion is based on the coverage a study gives, which may include information that ranges from a general discussion of techniques and approaches, peculiar matters, such as task interactions and condition types, relevant to our conceptual framework, to properties, such as domain authoring, expressiveness and competence, that may be a part of the analytical framework.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">HTN planning assumes an initial task network {a mathematical formula}tn0 to be accomplished as an objective for {a mathematical formula}P. In its simplest form, {a mathematical formula}tn0 does not allow to specify conditions to be satisfied in some intermediate state during or in the final state of the execution of the solution to {a mathematical formula}P. Extended goals enable to express a planning objective in a way that its satisfaction could be on a part, on the whole trajectory of the solution, or in the final state.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">There is a number of systems that use different approaches to learn domain knowledge from examples: one approach learns preconditions of SHOP-like methods given the method structure as input to the system [18], another one learns incrementally approximate preconditions [148], an approach learns very general HTNs by learning from expert traces [149], or another one that learns HTNs with a better balance between generality and specificity [150].</a>
