<a href="#0" id="0">We now consider a single linear layer with k output units{a mathematical formula} In this case, dropout applied to input units is slightly different from dropout applied to the connections.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Dropout applied to the input units leads to the random variables{a mathematical formula} whereas dropout applied to the connections leads to the random variables{a mathematical formula} In either case, the expectations, variances, and covariances can easily be computed using the linearity of the expectation and the independence assumption.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus in summary with any distribution{a mathematical formula}P(N)over all possible sub-networks{a mathematical formula}N, including the case of independent but not identically distributed input unit selector variables{a mathematical formula} Δ iwith probability{a mathematical formula}pi, the NWGM is simply obtained by applying the logistic function to the expectation of the linear input S. In the case of independent but not necessarily identically distributed selector variables{a mathematical formula} Δ i, each with a probability{a mathematical formula}piof being equal to one, the expectation of S can be computed simply by keeping the same overall network but multiplying each weight{a mathematical formula}wiby{a mathematical formula}piso that{a mathematical formula}E(S)= ∑ i=1npiwiIi.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is because it can be viewed as a form of on-line gradient descent with respect to the error function{a mathematical formula} of the true ensemble, where {a mathematical formula}t(I) is the target value for input I and {a mathematical formula}fw is the elementary error function, typically the squared error in regression, or the relative entropy error in classification, which depends on the weights w. In the case of dropout, the probability {a mathematical formula}P(N) of the network {a mathematical formula}N is factorial and associated with the product of the underlying Bernoulli selector variables.</a>
