<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:6} Notice that, the exponential size of the game tree does not constitute a proof that finding the equilibrium strategies of an SRG-v requires exponential time in the parameters of the game because it does not exclude the existence of some compact representation of {a mathematical formula}D's strategies, e.g., Markovian strategies.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If otherwise, the condition is verified, then the algorithm (assuming validity of Conditions 1 and 2) might obtain a covering set {a mathematical formula}Q¯v,wk+1 which is not a proper one, meaning that by walking its generative route at least one target {a mathematical formula}t ′ ∉ Q¯v,wk+1 gets covered.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It can be observed that, given a value of Ε , the ratios obtained with the dynamic programming algorithm are essentially constant as {a mathematical formula}|T| increases and this constant reduced as Ε reduces.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Surprisingly, after a certain value of {a mathematical formula}|T|, the game values obtained with the branch and bound algorithm are higher than those obtained with the dynamic programming algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is because, fixed a value of Ε , as {a mathematical formula}|T| increases, the problem becomes easier and the heuristic used by the branch and bound algorithm performs well finding the best covering routes.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This shows that there is not an algorithm outperforming the other for every combination of parameters {a mathematical formula}|T| and Ε .</a>
