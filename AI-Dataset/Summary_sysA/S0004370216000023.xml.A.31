<a href="#0" id="0">Next, by means of another counterexample, we show that the converse inclusion does not hold either, i.e.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">that not all TRPMMCs are spheres filtration-based multiple contractions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, in the following counterexample we present a transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction function ÷ on a belief set K which is different from the {a mathematical formula}S filtration-based multiple contraction {a mathematical formula}÷S, for any system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In what follows we present some definitions of multiple contraction functions on a belief set K which are based on a system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .</a>
