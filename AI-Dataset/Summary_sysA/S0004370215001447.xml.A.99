<a href="#0" id="0">To this end, Table 15 provides grounding parameters, obtained by running gringo-4 under the same time and memory limits as participant systems, along with the scores of systems in the SP category (except for wasp-wpm1-only-weak, which did not participate in the majority of domains) on previous and novel encoding variants, given in the upper or lower row, respectively, per domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We performed a number of ex-post analyses on the results of the 2011 and 2013 editions, experimenting with different scoring schemes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">At first, we found that time quota did not make much difference and accordingly use {a mathematical formula}Ssolve(P) only (simply denoted {a mathematical formula}S(P) in Section 3.5), which as before linearly reflects the number of solved instances of a Decision or Query problem P. Furthermore, we pondered that absolute objective values are not adequate for scoring solutions for Optimization problems, given that they depend heavily on domains and are susceptible to perturbations; rather than that, relative rankings can draw a more reliable picture.</a>
