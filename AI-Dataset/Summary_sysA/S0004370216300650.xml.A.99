<a href="#0" id="0">Note that in case v is Boolean and {a mathematical formula}A,B are complementary Boolean domains (e.g., {a mathematical formula}A={0},B={1}) then this rule simplifies to the standard resolution rule for propositional clauses that is used in SAT, namely the consequent becomes {a mathematical formula}(X ∨ Y).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we showed in [11], we used this rule in our CSP solver HCSP (short for HaifaCSP),{sup:1} as part of a general learning scheme based on signed clauses.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This means that there is at least one value {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Dx ′ such that{a mathematical formula} This can be simplified to{a mathematical formula} If such Α exists then it can be equal to {a mathematical formula}max ⁡ (Dx ′ ) such that{a mathematical formula}</a>
