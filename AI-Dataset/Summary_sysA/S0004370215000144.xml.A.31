<a href="#0" id="0">According to the results in Table 6 (page 101), arvandherd and ayalsoplan solved more problems with the highest score.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, the difference between arvandherd and all the other entrants, as evidenced by the statistical test performed in Section 4.4.1 for which results are summarized in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">16 (page 103), is deemed statistically significant.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">ayalsoplan appears to be dominated by roamer-p and has indistinguishable performance from phsff.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, these two planners were ranked far behind ayalsoplan.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, the following planners were distinguished by their performance in the sequential multi-core track of IPC-2011:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Unfortunately, it is not as straightforward to compare the plan quality for these two planners because the scoring schema used in IPC-2011 may assign a planner a better score simply because the other planners in the same track were worse (Sections 2.3 and 6).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, to provide a better assessment of differences in plan quality between lama-2011 and arvandherd, an alternative competition was simulated with all entrants in both the sequential multi-core and satisficing tracks, yielding a total number of 35 entrants.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this way, both planners were compared with regard to the solutions provided by the same set of planners.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The results indicate that the score for lama-2011 slightly decreased from 216.33 to 215.51, while the score for arvandherd decreased even more, from 227.07 to 210.41.</a>
