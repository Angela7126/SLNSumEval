<a href="#6" id="6">The first indicator, noted cf, measures the performance of algorithm selection on known problem instances based on an excerpt of matrix {a mathematical formula}M. After the above discussion, the cf performance reflects the quality of the set of problem instances, called benchmark in the following.</a>
