<a href="#0" id="0">Every action that a BayesAct agent can take (a) has an affective aspect or “ meaning ” ({a mathematical formula}ba in Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">facial expressions) can be viewed as a method for communicating an agent's current appraisal of the situation in terms of affective identities that the agent perceives, and would be part of the action space {a mathematical formula}ba.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The perception of emotional displays would be simply integrated into BayesAct using observations of client identity, {a mathematical formula}Fc.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The continuous action space for BayesAct can be handled by leveraging the fact the we can predict what an agent would “ normally ” do in any state according to the affect control principle: it is the action that minimises the deflection.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have done preliminary simulations with this model by using an agent identity of “ assistant ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[1.5,0.51,0.45]), and an initial client identity of “ patient ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.90, − 0.69, − 1.05]).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The client knows the identity of the agent, but the agent must learn the identity of the client.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Agent and client both know their own identities.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We investigated the COACH system in simulation using an agent with an affective identity of “ assistant ” , and a client with an affective identity of “ elder ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[1.67,0.01, − 1.03]).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The client knows the identity of the agent, but the agent must learn the identity of the client.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Agent and client both know their own identities.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Table E.12 shows the same client ( “ elder ” ) but this time the agent always uses the same affective actions: if prompting, it “ commands ” the user ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[ − 0.09,1.29,1.59]) and when not prompting it “ minds ” the user ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.86,0.17, − 0.16]).</a>
