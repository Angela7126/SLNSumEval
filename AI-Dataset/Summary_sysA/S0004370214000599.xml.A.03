<a href="#1" id="1">That is each {a mathematical formula} Δ l describes a different set of channel relationships.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Sampling the active features {a mathematical formula}f(i) for channel i follows as in Fox et al.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We block sample the event state sequence {a mathematical formula}Z1:T and then sample the event state transition distributions Φ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}zt denote the vector of N channel states at time t. Since the space of {a mathematical formula}zt is exponentially large, we cannot integrate it out to compute the marginal conditional likelihood of the data given the event state sequence {a mathematical formula}Z1:T (and model parameters).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Instead, we consider the conditional likelihood of an observation at time t given channel states {a mathematical formula}zt and event state {a mathematical formula}Zt=l,{a mathematical formula} Recalling Eq.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The mechanics of sampling the event state sequence {a mathematical formula}Z1:T directly parallel those of sampling the individual channel state sequences {a mathematical formula}z1:T(i).</a>
