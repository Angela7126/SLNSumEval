<a href="#0" id="0">In this game there are four joint actions which promote and demote values as shown in Table 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Now the values will be expected to be promoted and demoted according to the probability of the second player's response, as shown in Table 3, and so the expected utility can be calculated, taking account of the complete set of joint actions that include a particular individual action.</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">Argument (2) is rather weak: although the expected utility is always positive, the proposed action may have a lower expected utility than the alternative for some (or even all) values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j1).</a>
