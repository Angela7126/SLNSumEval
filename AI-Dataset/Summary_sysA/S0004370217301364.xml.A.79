<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula} It is immediate to check that everything discussed above with respect to the original set of AICs also applies to its normalized counterpart, i.e., intuitively, these constraints represent the same knowledge and the sets of repairs and weak repairs remain unchanged.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In our translation of AICs to logic programs, namely in Theorem 7.6, we assume that {a mathematical formula}DB= ∅ and that the only update actions that occur in heads of rules are positive, i.e., of the form +a.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In turn, the two last computations can be done in polynomial time: they require evaluating each literal in the body of each rule from Η with head Α or {a mathematical formula} Α D and computing its truth value under the database updated by {a mathematical formula}U.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a set of update actions {a mathematical formula}U, checking that it is a fixpoint of {a mathematical formula}T Η can be done in polynomial time on the size of DB and Η , as shown in Proposition 8.1; the NP-oracle can then answer whether there exists {a mathematical formula}U ′ ⊊ U with {a mathematical formula}T Η (U ′ ) ∩ U ⊆ U ′ , thereby establishing whether {a mathematical formula}U is grounded.</a>
