<a href="#0" id="0">This collection of tracks was the end-result of an attempt to find a balance between the very large number of tracks (pure SAT, pure UNSAT, SAT+UNSAT for each of the categories, Application, Crafted, and Random; and instantiation-specific special tracks) organized in the SAT Competitions, and the strict application orientation of the SAT-Races (only “ industrial ” Application SAT+UNSAT).</a>
