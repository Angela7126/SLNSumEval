<a href="#0" id="0">For a network with {a mathematical formula}|V| nodes, there are {a mathematical formula}2|V − 1| − 1 cluster constraints; rather than initially adding such a large number of constraints, they are only added explicitly to the problem as cuts if a relaxed solution would violate them.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The improvement in the speed with which the simplex algorithm runs though must of course be weighed against the fact that additional time will be needed to identify the violated constraints to add and the fact that the simplex algorithm must be run repeatedly, rather than once at each node of the search tree.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The convex hull P appears to be extremely complicated in the general case, though we have empirically found the complete set of constraints defining the convex hull of the problem when the number of nodes in the network is limited to 3 or 4.</a>
