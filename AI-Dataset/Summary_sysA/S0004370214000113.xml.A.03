<a href="#0" id="0">The diagnosis model {a mathematical formula}S is split into n diagnosis submodels {a mathematical formula}S1,S2, â€¦ ,Sn, where each diagnosis submodel gets a subset of the fault set, a subset of the measurement set, and a subset of the residual set.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That is, a diagnosis submodel {a mathematical formula}Si is globally diagnosable if all the faults {a mathematical formula}Fi are distinguishable from every other fault in F, i.e., all other faults in S, using only the residuals in {a mathematical formula}Ri.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This diagnosis submodel is not globally diagnosable, because faults not included in {a mathematical formula}Fi can produce the same observations as a fault in {a mathematical formula}Fi, as demonstrated in the previous example.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, given the residual set for the PCs (see Table 2), the diagnosis model is not diagnosable since fault {a mathematical formula}Re1+ cannot be distinguished from fault {a mathematical formula}Re12+, and fault {a mathematical formula}Re2+ cannot be distinguished from fault {a mathematical formula}Re23+.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, consider diagnosis submodel {a mathematical formula}S3.</a>
