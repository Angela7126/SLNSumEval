<a href="#0" id="0">The key innovations include: 1) the use of a sampling algorithm, RRT, which was originally developed for robot motion planning, to explore the state space; 2) a search heuristic that biases growth of the RRT tree towards the unsafe set; 3) metrics that provide information about the completeness of the search, which can be used to obtain a probabilistic certificate of validation; and 4) an extension of RRT called “ Recursively Refined RRT ” , which uses progressively smaller time steps to improve the resolution of the RRT tree.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Temporally Feasible ActivityGiven an activity and associated plant, the activity is Temporally Feasible in the duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u] if{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This states that the set of plant feasible trajectories includes ones that go from {a mathematical formula}Rinit to {a mathematical formula}Rgoal over the entire duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">More specifically, if a trajectory starting anywhere in the initial region, {a mathematical formula}Rinit, of the activity (see Definition 8) and ending somewhere in the goal region, {a mathematical formula}Rgoal, at any duration d such that {a mathematical formula}l ≤ d ≤ u, is Plant Feasible, then the activity is temporally feasible in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to support efficient execution, the flow tube representation must allow the dispatcher to: 1) quickly determine whether a feasible state trajectory exists from the current state, and 2) if such a trajectory exists, what the control commands should be (based on a control policy) that achieve the trajectory.</a>
