<a href="#0" id="0">In each node we use our data structure of colorings and compute all valid colorings C for every node t. As shown in [112], there exists a one-to-one mapping between the extensions of C, {a mathematical formula}et(C), and the {a mathematical formula}X>t-restricted admissible sets for {a mathematical formula}F ≥ t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, we assume that the root node r has an empty bag of arguments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We only give a rough outline of the ideas to extend the above algorithm for preferred semantics, for details the interested reader is referred to [40].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As preferred extensions are subset-maximal admissible sets in order to guarantee subset maximality one can use pairs {a mathematical formula}(C, Γ ) as a data structure within a node t instead of colorings.</a>
