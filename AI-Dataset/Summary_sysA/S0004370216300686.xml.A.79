<a href="#0" id="0">Soft Global Constraint [56]A soft global constraint, denoted by {a mathematical formula}Soft_GC Μ (S ∪ {z},A1, … ,At), is a family of hard constraints parameterized by a violation measure Μ , a scope S, a cost variable z, and possibly extra parameters {a mathematical formula}A1, … ,At.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Global Cost Function [48], [65]A global cost function, denoted as {a mathematical formula}W_GCF(S,A1, … ,At), is a family of cost functions parameterized by a scope S and possibly extra parameters {a mathematical formula}A1, … ,At.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is possible to derive a global cost function from an existing soft global constraint {a mathematical formula}Soft_GC Μ (S ∪ {z},A1, … ,At).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this case, we denote the corresponding global cost function as {a mathematical formula}W_GCF Μ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the following, given a tractable global cost function {a mathematical formula}WS, we denote by {a mathematical formula} ∇ r(WS) the global cost function resulting from the application of an arbitrary finite sequence of r-EPTs on {a mathematical formula}WS.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the softened variant {a mathematical formula}W_AllDifferentdec(S) of the global constraint {a mathematical formula}AllDifferent(S) constraint using the decomposition violation measure where the cost of an assignment is the number of pairs of variables taking the same value [56].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By the assumption that extra variables belong to at least two cost functions (see paragraph below Definition 21), leaf variables necessarily belong to S. We denote by {a mathematical formula}leaf(T) the set of leaf variables in the scope T. The first type of node aims at computing the value of the cost function {a mathematical formula}WT combined with the unary cost functions on each leaf variable.</a>
