<a href="#0" id="0">Observe that the input to the complete set partitioning problem is a list of {a mathematical formula}2n − 1 real values (where n is the size of the ground set), and every algorithm that is guaranteed to find an optimal solution on every instance of this problem has to inspect all of these values.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, the running time of every exact algorithm is at least exponential in n, and in some of the applications we have discussed (such as combinatorial auctions or multi-agent systems) the value of n can be quite large.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, an important goal is to design an algorithm that can find an optimal partition as efficiently as possible, both in the worst case and on average (for realistic value distributions).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Now, to use this information, IP is modified so that, at depth d, it checks whether one of the following inequalities holds:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} If (12) holds, then {a mathematical formula}{C1, … ,Cd} is not an optimal partition of {a mathematical formula}C1 ∪ ⋯ ∪ Cd, and so there does not exist an optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ such that {a mathematical formula}{C1, … ,Cd} ⊆ CS ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Similarly, if (13) holds, then {a mathematical formula}{Cd} is not an optimal partition of {a mathematical formula}Cd, and so there does not exist an optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ such that {a mathematical formula}Cd ∈ CS ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In either case, every coalition structure containing {a mathematical formula}{C1, … ,Cd} can be skipped during the search.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">[33]; it represents every {a mathematical formula}Si as a union of integer partition-based subspaces.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consequently, one can readily extend this algorithm by using IP (or ODP-IP) to search every {a mathematical formula}Si.All the algorithms in this class discussed so far are proposed for characteristic function games, where there are no influences among co-existing coalitions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To this end, observe that if {a mathematical formula}d=|I| − 1, then there is no need to determine whether {a mathematical formula}{C1, … ,Cd} is promising.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Instead, one can straight away construct the only coalition structure of size {a mathematical formula}|I| containing {a mathematical formula}C1, … ,Cd — it suffices to put all the remaining agents in a coalition of their own.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, whenever the branch-and-bound technique is used, we always have {a mathematical formula}d<|I| − 1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This implies that, when {a mathematical formula}I ⁎ contains exactly one integer, we always have {a mathematical formula}min ⁡ (d,|I ∖ I ⁎ |)=d.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Consequently, inequality (E.2) can be written as follows:{a mathematical formula} This way, we get rid of the first modification, and only keep the second one, which takes into consideration only the subspaces that have not yet been searched, and are reachable from {a mathematical formula} Π IA.</a>
