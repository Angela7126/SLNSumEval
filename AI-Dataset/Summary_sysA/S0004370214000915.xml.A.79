<a href="#0" id="0">Our running example suggests that duality also holds for deletion-diagnoses and -explanations, which indeed is true: For every inconsistent MCS M,{a mathematical formula} ⋃ Dm − (M)= ⋃ Em+(M), i.e., the unions of all minimal deletion-diagnoses and all minimal deletion-inconsistency explanations coincide.This is a direct consequence of Theorem 4 (set in its proof the second components of diagnoses and explanations to the empty set).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Disregarding possible rule preferences, a logic program P with CR rules CR can be embedded to an MCS {a mathematical formula}M=(C1), where the single context {a mathematical formula}C1 is over disjunctive logic programs, such that the answer sets of P with CR correspond to the witnessing equilibria of the minimal diagnoses {a mathematical formula}(D1,D2) of M. In more detail, {a mathematical formula}C1 has the knowledge base {a mathematical formula}kb1=P ∪ {cr(r)|r ∈ CR} and bridge rules {a mathematical formula}br1={(c1:ab(r)) ← a ⊥ .|r ∈ CR}, where {a mathematical formula}a ⊥ and {a mathematical formula}ab(r) are fresh atoms, for each r as above, and{a mathematical formula} informally, unconditional firing of a bridge rule simulates the corresponding CR rule; note that {a mathematical formula}D1= ∅ .</a>
