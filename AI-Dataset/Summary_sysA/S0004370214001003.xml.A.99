<a href="#0" id="0">However, this method has only been demonstrated for households containing up to 5 appliance types, and the large state space introduced by 15 – 20 appliance types is likely to cause the inference process to be unable to distinguish between appliances.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We denote the posterior parameters as {a mathematical formula}C ˜ i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the case of the refrigerator, there is a sufficient amount of training data available in existing appliance data sets, and so a uniform prior is also a sufficient distribution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">More formally, this tuning process directly corresponds to learning the parameters {a mathematical formula} Θ (n) for an appliance instance n in a household, given the appliance type's general model Θ and the household's aggregate data x.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This threshold is set such that the model will accept windows of data which can be explained by a set of appliance parameters drawn from the given appliance type's general model, and reject any windows of data generated by other appliance types or combinations of appliances.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, this process effectively identifies windows of aggregate data during which only an appliance matching its general model changes state.</a>
