<a href="#0" id="0">In order to study the effectiveness of our proposed approach for algorithm design, we configured SATenstein-LS on training sets from various distributions of SAT instances and compared the performance of the SATenstein-LS solvers thus obtained against that of several existing high-performance SAT solvers on disjoint test sets.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For each instance distribution D, we compared the performance of SATenstein-LS[D] against that of 11 high-performance SLS-based SAT solvers on the respective test set.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We included every SLS algorithm that won a medal in any category of a SAT competitions between 2002 and 2007, because those algorithms are all part of the SATenstein-LS design space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This indicates that many interesting designs that could compete with existing high-performance solvers still remain unexplored in SLS design space.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In addition, we found that all SATenstein-LS configurations differ from existing SLS algorithms (except for SATenstein[FAC], whose configuration and performance is similar to SAPS).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This underscores the importance of an automated approach, since manually finding such good configurations from a huge design space is very difficult.</a>
