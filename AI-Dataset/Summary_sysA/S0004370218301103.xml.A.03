<a href="#1" id="1">Using this definition, a PR algorithm is complete if it returns a hypothesis set H such that {a mathematical formula}h ∼ rh ⁎ → h ∈ H, that is, H contains all possible hypotheses that can be refined to {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ .</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">Query functionA query QA is a function that receives as input a plan p and outputs whether one of the plans in the correct hypothesis {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ can be refined from p.{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">SPR processSPR process takes as input a set of hypotheses {a mathematical formula}H0, a query function QA and a query policy Π .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, a query is performed on p, and the result is used to generate an updated hypothesis set {a mathematical formula}Hi+1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">2, if {a mathematical formula}QA(p1)=True then we know that the correct hypothesis {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ will contain a complete plan that is a refinement of {a mathematical formula}p11.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Similarly, if the query result is True, then the entropy of the resulting hypothesis set is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} Recall that {a mathematical formula} Φ (H,p,True) is the set of all hypotheses that contain at least one plan which is a match of p (Equation (2)).</a>
