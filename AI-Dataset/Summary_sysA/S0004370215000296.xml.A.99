<a href="#0" id="0">Temporally Feasible ActivityGiven an activity and associated plant, the activity is Temporally Feasible in the duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u] if{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This states that the set of plant feasible trajectories includes ones that go from {a mathematical formula}Rinit to {a mathematical formula}Rgoal over the entire duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">More specifically, if a trajectory starting anywhere in the initial region, {a mathematical formula}Rinit, of the activity (see Definition 8) and ending somewhere in the goal region, {a mathematical formula}Rgoal, at any duration d such that {a mathematical formula}l ≤ d ≤ u, is Plant Feasible, then the activity is temporally feasible in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This implies that the actuation limits imposed by the plant, and the operating constraints of the activity allow for actuation commands that can be used to control the linearized subsystem to the goal region from the initial region, at any duration in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to support efficient execution, the flow tube representation must allow the dispatcher to: 1) quickly determine whether a feasible state trajectory exists from the current state, and 2) if such a trajectory exists, what the control commands should be (based on a control policy) that achieve the trajectory.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The algorithm iterates over each activity in the QSP, calling ComputeFlowTubeForActivity.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If the result is a flow tube with no valid cross sections, then the algorithm stops and indicates an error; the QSP is infeasible.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, unlike discrete activity systems, which can simply set the occurrence of events so that they coincide with target completion times, our dispatcher must generate control inputs that guide the hybrid plant to its goal state at the target completion time.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, the activity completion event time cannot simply be set, but rather, occurs as a consequence of the control policy applied to the plant dynamics.</a>
