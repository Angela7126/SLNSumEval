<a href="#0" id="0">For each agent {a mathematical formula}ai we assume that no other agent exists and calculate its optimal individual path cost from all states in the state space to {a mathematical formula}goali; this is usually done by a reverse search from the goal.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When the ID framework is applied to k agents (whose start and goal locations are randomized) the resulting effective number of agents, {a mathematical formula}k ′ , is noisy and its variance is very large.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, for this experiment we followed [42] and created problem instances where all agents are dependent, according to the ID framework.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}aj are now going to be merged, internal conflicts should not be considered as {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}aj will be solved in a coupled manner by the low level.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, we only consider external constraints from that point on.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Assume that agents {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}aj are to be merged into a new meta agent {a mathematical formula}a{i,j} and that {a mathematical formula}ai has the external constraint {a mathematical formula}(ai,v,t).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This constraint means that further up in the CT, {a mathematical formula}ai had a conflict with some other agent {a mathematical formula}ar at location v at time t and therefore {a mathematical formula}ai is not allowed to be located at location v at time t.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The new meta agent must include all external constraints.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Assume an external constraint {a mathematical formula}(ai,v,t).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">After merging {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}aj this constraint should apply only to the original agent, {a mathematical formula}ai, and not apply to the entire meta-agent, i.e., {a mathematical formula}{ai} ∪ {aj}.</a>
