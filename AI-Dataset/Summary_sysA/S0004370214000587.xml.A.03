<a href="#0" id="0">Suppose {a mathematical formula}F() is the fractal encoding of image B.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a target image B and a source image A, the fractal encoding algorithm seeks to discover this particular set of transformations T.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The partitioning scheme P extracts a set of images {a mathematical formula}bi from the target image B.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let us label the representation of the fractal transformation from image A to image B as {a mathematical formula}TAB.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this example, the problem is to determine for which of the candidate images the transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ is made most analogous to transformation T. We first will represent T as a fractal representation, and then generate a set of candidate transformations Ω as shown in Fig.</a>
