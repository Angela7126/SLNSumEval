<a href="#0" id="0">Consider again the credibility base of our running example introduced in Example 2:{a mathematical formula} There are seven arguments that can be built from {a mathematical formula}C2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An AFRA is expressed as a set of arguments and a set of attacks, where an attack is a pair {a mathematical formula}(A,T) such that {a mathematical formula}A is an argument and {a mathematical formula}T is either an argument or an attack [4].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To instantiate an AFRA, we will use arguments and attacks obtained from a credibility base, and then we will analyze which elements are accepted from this framework.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, each credibility base will characterize a particular AFRA which will be called its associated AFRA.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C8 introduced in Example 8.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The associated AFRA of this base is characterized by the arguments and attacks that were depicted in Fig.</a>
