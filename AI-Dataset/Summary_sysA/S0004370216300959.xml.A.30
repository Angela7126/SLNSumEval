<a href="#0" id="0">In order to induce the English Wikipedia bitaxonomy, i.e., a taxonomy of pages and categories, we proceed in 3 phases:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">5a plots the coverage of the Wikipedia pages as hypernym linkers are applied in the presented order.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Two lines are shown: the blue line plots the number of pages with at least one hypernym, the green line shows the number of total hypernyms found up to a certain phase.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Again, since MultiWiBi extracts more than one hypernym lemma for any given page, the total number of hypernyms is higher than the total number of Wikipedia pages.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Wikipedia pages We first report the results of the knowledge resources which provide page hypernyms, i.e., we compare against WikiNet, DBpedia, MENTA, YAGO3 and LHD.</a>
