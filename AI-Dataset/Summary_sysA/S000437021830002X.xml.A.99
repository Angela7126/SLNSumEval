<a href="#0" id="0">In the context of SAT, one often considers structural restrictions on a graphical representation of the formula (such as the primal graph), and the aim is to design efficient fixed-parameter algorithms for SAT, i.e., algorithms running in time {a mathematical formula}O(f(k)nO(1)) where k is the value of the considered structural parameter for the given SAT instance and n is its input size.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let Α be a solution of {a mathematical formula}var(I) of value {a mathematical formula}w= Η ( Α ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since {a mathematical formula}F ′ ⊆ F, it follows that setting {a mathematical formula} Α ′ to be a restriction of Α to {a mathematical formula}var(I) ∖ Ty satisfies every inequality in {a mathematical formula}F ′ .</a>
