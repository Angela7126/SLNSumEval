<a href="#0" id="0">Recalling the meaning of the modal product operation, the expression ‘ {a mathematical formula}[!Ae] Φ ’ therefore stands for ‘ after installing the new epistemic protocol {a mathematical formula}Ae, the formula Φ is true ’ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As an example, let us give the model of Example 1 from the introduction, the epistemic expectation model induced by the epistemic protocol (modelled on p. 27, call it {a mathematical formula}Ae), and the updated model according to observation a (in the picture, visualized by {a mathematical formula}|a):{a mathematical formula} Recall the original model {a mathematical formula}M:{a mathematical formula} Now we can verify for the actual state s:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now we can verify the following:{a mathematical formula} Formally, one needs first to convert {a mathematical formula} Η 1 with respect to {a mathematical formula}FLB into the corresponding normal form using the guarded automata construction of Proposition 41, and then construct the epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}M ⊗ Η 1FLB according to Definition 42, and finally check the truth value of the remaining {a mathematical formula}[! Η 1FLB]-free formula on this model.</a>
