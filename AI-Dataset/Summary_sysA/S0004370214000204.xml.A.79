<a href="#1" id="1">Note that the steady set {a mathematical formula}St of {a mathematical formula}M for Π always exists and is unique.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Indeed, {a mathematical formula} Π M ← nd is a Horn positive CNF and it is known that these kinds of theories have one and only one minimal model (which can be computed in polynomial time) [11], [27].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First of all, since {a mathematical formula}M is a model of Π , by definition of model all the constraints (aka empty-head clauses) of Π are true in {a mathematical formula}M and are also true in any subset of {a mathematical formula}M. Hence, they can be disregarded during the subsequent steps (see line 1).Moreover, note that, by definition of steady set, it follows that the set {a mathematical formula}St computed at the beginning of each iteration of the algorithm (line 4) is a (not necessarily proper) subset of every minimal model contained in {a mathematical formula}M. Let n be the number of atoms in the model {a mathematical formula}M computed at line 1 of the GEA.Three cases are possible, which are discussed next:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then,{a mathematical formula}GEA Ξ HEF( Π ,M)computes, in polynomial time, a minimal model of Π contained in{a mathematical formula}M.Because of Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.2, in order to prove the statement, it is sufficient to show that (i) {a mathematical formula} Ξ HEF returns an erasable set, if such a set exists, and an empty one otherwise (namely that {a mathematical formula} Ξ HEF is, in fact, an eliminating operator) and that (ii) {a mathematical formula} Ξ HEF runs in polynomial time.Let us consider first point (i).</a>
