<a href="#0" id="0">In the face of this growing interest, we lack a clearly defined field of integrated AI and Robotics, which articulates methods, representations and mechanisms that lead to enablement, while laying out challenges and solutions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The disconnect with real world problem solving in turn led the community down a variety of paths which have had little long-term impact; a case in point are the Planning competitions,{sup:1} where there is substantial algorithmic overfitting to the rules of the competition, while much remains to be desired in terms of the connect to real-world problem solving.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We claim that most of these factors have a common origin: Robots operate in a closed loop with the physical environment, and must necessarily deal with aspects like strict timing, continuous values, complex dependencies and uncertainty; but tools and techniques developed in AI often assume those aspects away.</a>
