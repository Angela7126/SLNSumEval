<a href="#0" id="0">Then, we can say that the target values {a mathematical formula}yi are sampled from the following Gaussian distribution,{a mathematical formula} Further, we assume that data points are independent and identically distributed (IID), and that expert predictions for the ith data point are sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution as{a mathematical formula} This assumption allows the experts to be correlated (i.e., {a mathematical formula} Σ K is non-diagonal), as is the case in practice in the aerosol domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given the model parameters Θ , probability of observing the data set {a mathematical formula}D can be written as{a mathematical formula} where subscripts u and l denote unlabeled and labeled parts of the data set, respectively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">RMSE is defined as follows,{a mathematical formula} where the sum is over N labeled data points from the test set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This resulted in a labeled data set with {a mathematical formula}N=23,119 data points, where 67% of expert predictions were missing.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Both {a mathematical formula}xi and {a mathematical formula}x ˜ i vectors were always available for all data points.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We randomly sampled from each training site 50 labeled and 50 unlabeled data points, and from the left-out site sampled 50 labeled data points used for validation, assuming {a mathematical formula} Σ → ∞ .</a>
