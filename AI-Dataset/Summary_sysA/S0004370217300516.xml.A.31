<a href="#0" id="0">The concept of Σ -optimal coalition structure illustrated in the above section is clearly more general than the counterpart where no valuation structure Σ is considered.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Indeed, given any coalitional game {a mathematical formula} Γ = 〈 N,v 〉 , by defining {a mathematical formula} ⊥ = 〈 KN 〉 as the valuation structure where {a mathematical formula}KN is the complete interaction graph over the set N of agents, we can immediately check that any coalition {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ N is ⊥ -feasible and that {a mathematical formula}val ⊥ (v,S)=v(S) holds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, results in the literature where no valuation structures have been considered (see Section 1) can be viewed as results that hold over ⊥ -optimal coalition structures.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An instance for the coalition structure generation problem on valuation structures, denoted in the following as {a mathematical formula}CSGval, is a pair {a mathematical formula}( Γ , Σ ), where {a mathematical formula} Γ =(N,v) is a coalitional game, and {a mathematical formula} Σ = 〈 G,S, Α , Β ,x,y 〉 is a valuation structure on Γ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The goal is to compute a Σ -optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ ∈ CS-opt Σ ( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The problem generalizes on the valuation structure Σ the well-known coalition structure generation problem (short: CSG), which is just the special case where the trivial valuation structure ⊥ is considered.</a>
