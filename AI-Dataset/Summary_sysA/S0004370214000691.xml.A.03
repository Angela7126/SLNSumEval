<a href="#0" id="0">The analysis of the case where bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information is an instance of the case where the auctioneer needs to calculate her expected-benefit-maximizing strategy given the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, as given in Section 3.2, for {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Overall, we observe that the increase in the number of bidders results in an increase in the auctioneer's expected benefit and a decrease in the bidders' expected benefit (for any number of agents {a mathematical formula}n1>n2 and cost C for which the same decision of whether or not to purchase the information is made).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Nevertheless, since the cost at which the transition between purchasing the information to not purchasing it also increases as n increases, it is possible that for some costs, with {a mathematical formula}n1 bidders the information is not purchased in equilibrium and with {a mathematical formula}n2>n1 the information is purchased in equilibrium, yielding to the auctioneer an expected benefit lower than the one obtained for {a mathematical formula}n1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this case the expected benefit of the auctioneer with 5 bidders is greater than her expected benefit with {a mathematical formula}n=6.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">5, if the cost of purchasing the information is {a mathematical formula}C<6 then the auctioneer's expected benefit is greater than the one resulting from not having the option to purchase the information in the first place.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Here, for any cost {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ C ≤ 4.05 the equilibrium in the bidders' awareness case is {a mathematical formula}({x1,x2,x3},{x1,x2,x3}) and its expected benefit to the auctioneer is greater than in the case where bidders are unaware of the option of purchasing the information.</a>
