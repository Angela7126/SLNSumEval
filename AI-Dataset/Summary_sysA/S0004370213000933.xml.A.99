<a href="#0" id="0">Then, for good crossover, the probability of generating a new {a mathematical formula}qi in one step is at least {a mathematical formula}12 ⋅ (12 ⋅ 1|P| − 1) ⋅ 1m, where {a mathematical formula}12 is the probability of applying crossover, {a mathematical formula}(12 ⋅ 1|P| − 1) is the probability of selecting two specific Pareto optimal solutions and {a mathematical formula}1m is the probability of selecting a proper crossover point; and for good mutation, the probability of generating a new {a mathematical formula}qi in one step is at least {a mathematical formula}12 ⋅ 1|P| − 1 ⋅ 1m2(1 − 1m)m − 2 by Lemma 6, where {a mathematical formula}12 is the probability of applying mutation, {a mathematical formula}1|P| − 1 is the lower bound for the probability of selecting a specific solution, and {a mathematical formula}1m2(1 − 1m)m − 2 is the probability of flipping two specific bits.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Because for any value of one objective, there exists at most one corresponding solution in the population, we have {a mathematical formula}|P| ⩽ nwmin.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, the above two probabilities become at least {a mathematical formula}14mnwmin and {a mathematical formula}12em2nwmin respectively, which implies that the expected running time of a good crossover and a good mutation is at most {a mathematical formula}4mnwmin and {a mathematical formula}2em2nwmin respectively.</a>
