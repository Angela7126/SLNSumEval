<a href="#0" id="0">This is not a real restriction, since knowledge bases only have finitely many formulas in practice, which means that only finitely many certainty levels actually need to be used, and since the semantics of GPL is based on the relative ordering of the certainty degrees, we can then always map these certainty degrees to {a mathematical formula} Λ k for some k. In Section 5, however, we will discuss an extension of GPL in which we can express comparative uncertainty statements, where it will be desirable to allow an unbounded number of certainty degrees at the semantic level.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It turns out that in general, if we restrict our attention to minimally specific Boolean e-models of GPL formulas of this type with {a mathematical formula}k=2, we obtain a semantics for reasoning from the absence of information, which captures the stable model semantics of answer set programs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, as in the proof of Proposition 14, without loss of generality, we can assume that the only meta-literals which occur in this meta-term are of the form {a mathematical formula}N Λ 1( Α 1) and {a mathematical formula} Δ Μ 1( Β 1), by refining any meta-literals of the form {a mathematical formula} Π Λ 1( Α 1) and {a mathematical formula} ∇ Μ 1( Β 1).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Before we present the proof of the main result, which will apply to arbitrary propositional combinations of comparative certainty statements, we show that the proposed axioms are sufficient for detecting inconsistencies in sets of statements of the form {a mathematical formula} Α ≻ Β .</a>
