<a href="#0" id="0">If the alternating fixpoint pair {a mathematical formula}(P Ω ,N Ω ) is a partition of {a mathematical formula}KA(K), it is then called the well-founded partition of {a mathematical formula}K.{sup:7}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Proposition 7 of [9], the authors show that for any {a mathematical formula}K Ξ ∈ KA(K), {a mathematical formula}K Ξ ∈ P Ω implies that {a mathematical formula}K Ξ is true in all three-valued MKNF models of {a mathematical formula}K, and {a mathematical formula}K Ξ ∈ KA(K)\N Ω implies that {a mathematical formula}K Ξ is false in all three-valued MKNF models of {a mathematical formula}K. It follows that if {a mathematical formula}K is MKNF-consistent, its alternating fixpoint pair is guaranteed to satisfy {a mathematical formula}P Ω ⊆ N Ω , i.e., it is a partition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Clearly, the number of iterations in the construction of the alternating fixpoint pair is linear in the number of K-atoms in {a mathematical formula}KA(K).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">That is, to satisfy {a mathematical formula}K¬c, {a mathematical formula}M ′ must not contain any interpretation that contains c, and we therefore can only expand M by adding ∅ or {a mathematical formula}{a} or both; in each of these cases, we have {a mathematical formula}(I ′ ,M ′ ,M) ⊭ Kb while {a mathematical formula}(I ′ ,M ′ ,M) ⊨ nota (independent of {a mathematical formula}I ′ ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As a result, the second rule is not satisfied.</a>
