<a href="#0" id="0">Also, we will prove some results that state that “ PROBLEM for ELECTION-SYSTEM over log-maverick-SP societies is in P. ” This is a shorthand for the claim that for each function f (that is computable in time polynomial in the size of the input — which is roughly {a mathematical formula} ‖ V ‖ ‖ C ‖ log ‖ C ‖ for the election {a mathematical formula}(C,V) itself plus whatever space is taken by other parameters — and to avoid possible technical problems, we should assume f is nondecreasing) whose value is {a mathematical formula}O(log(ProblemInputSize)), it holds that “ PROBLEM for ELECTION-SYSTEM over f-maverick-SP societies is in P, ” where the argument to f is the input size of the problem.</a>
