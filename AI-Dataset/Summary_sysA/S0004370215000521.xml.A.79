<a href="#0" id="0">The equivalence of the first two follows immediately from Proposition 5.2 since {a mathematical formula}I[U:f]=I ∖ U=I ∩ U¯ and for every set X, {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ U¯ if and only if {a mathematical formula}X ∩ U= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The equivalence of the second and third follows from the fact that {a mathematical formula}I ∖ U=I ∩ U¯ and for all subsets {a mathematical formula}X,Y and Z of Σ it holds that {a mathematical formula}X ∩ Y ⊆ Y ∖ Z if and only if {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ ( Σ ∖ Z).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Having defined the truth value of a constraint atom {a mathematical formula}C(X) in an interpretation I, an immediate consequence operator can be defined in the standard way:{a mathematical formula} Grounded models of this operator still represent the same intuitions: an interpretation I is grounded if it admits no unfounded sets, or said differently, if it contains no atoms without external support.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For arbitrary formula Φ in {a mathematical formula}LK, Q a possible world structure and I an interpretation, we define that Φ is satisfied with respect to Q and I (denoted {a mathematical formula}Q,I ⊨ Φ ) by the standard recursive rules of propositional satisfaction, augmented with one additional rule:{a mathematical formula} For objective formulas Φ , it holds that {a mathematical formula}Q,I ⊨ Φ if and only if {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ Φ .</a>
