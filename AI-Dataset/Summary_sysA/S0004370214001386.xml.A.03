<a href="#0" id="0">Consider {a mathematical formula}A*+ID on our example problem in Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This solution is now validated with the solution of agent {a mathematical formula}a3.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The task of the low level is to find a non-conflicting complete solution such that the cost of the individual path of agent {a mathematical formula}ai is exactly {a mathematical formula}Ci.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The path for agent {a mathematical formula}ai must be consistent with the constraints of {a mathematical formula}ai.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Node N in the CT is a goal node when {a mathematical formula}N.solution is valid, i.e., the set of paths for all agents has no conflicts.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The cost of a solution in {a mathematical formula}CV(N) is the sum of the costs of the individual agents.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The total number of time steps summed over all agents is {a mathematical formula}C ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We denote an execution of CBS with cost function Φ as {a mathematical formula}CBS Φ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}CM[i,j] accumulates the number of conflicts between agents {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}aj seen thus far by MA-CBS.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Consider the set of constraints associated with (meta-) agents {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}aj before the merge.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Assume that in the path chosen for each agent in the root CT node both agents {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}a2 are assigned vertex v at time step t. Next, MA-CBS branches according to the conflict {a mathematical formula}(a1,a2,v,t).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Two new CT nodes are generated {a mathematical formula}{N1,N2}.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If we allow the constraints imposed on agents {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}a2 to apply to agent {a mathematical formula}a3 we will block the optimal solution in both {a mathematical formula}N1 and {a mathematical formula}N2 which are the only two nodes in OPEN.</a>
