<a href="#0" id="0">TRAMP takes as inputs sets of action models from multiple source domains {a mathematical formula}{A1, … ,An}, bridges source and target domains based the Web and the plan traces, and outputs action models {a mathematical formula}A for the target domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If the source is not “ that ” similar to the target, the weights of the mapped knowledge will be low according to the weight learning procedure (i.e., Algorithm 4), since the mapped knowledge will not “ that ” strongly satisfy the input plan traces.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We define error rates of our learning algorithm as the difference between our learned action models and the action models (or the “ ground truth ” ) created by domain experts (assuming domain models created by domain experts are reliable or executable).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Specifically, both TRAMP and ARMS exploit the same sets of constraints when encoding action models in Step 3 of Algorithm 1; TRAMP calculates weights of formulas (i.e., F1 – F3, which will be filtered based on threshold Δ ) to statistically best explain plan traces, while ARMS exploited frequent set mining (using a presented threshold) to learn weights of constraints; it is reasonable that the accuracy of TRAMP is close to ARMS when tuning a proper threshold, i.e., {a mathematical formula} Δ =0.5 in the experiment.</a>
