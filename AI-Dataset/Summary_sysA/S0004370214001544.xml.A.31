<a href="#0" id="0">By considering the scenario of making pancakes, we aim to find the appropriate representations and inference mechanisms to enable robots to predict the effects of actions which depend on the way they are executed, i.e.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">their parameterizations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore we have designed, implemented, and analyzed a framework that allows us to envision the outcome of parameterized robot actions based on physics-based simulations [35], [36], [37].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">6 shows the robot Rosie pushing the spatula under pancake and envisioning the action through mental simulation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The general principle of the framework is depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">8, it is accessed via a logic-based interface, meaning that both the framework's input and output are formalized using first-order representations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The input is a description of a situated manipulation Scenario along with a parameterized Action plan that potentially solves the problem.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The output of the envisioning framework is a Timeline which holds information about object states, their relationships to other objects and the performed actions of the robot.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For example, a robot formalizes the problem of making pancakes by providing a minimalist description of the environment including the kitchen work space; manipulable objects such as a container holding the pancake mix and a spatula; and a specification of the robot itself.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In addition, the robot provides an instantiated action plan based on the plan's corresponding parameter space for pouring the ready-to-use pancake mix onto the pancake maker, flipping the half-baked pancake and placing the fully-baked pancake onto a plate.</a>
