<a href="#0" id="0">We attempt to realize this strategy in the noisy MOO algorithm by introducing a test criterion on the fitness variance in the local neighborhood of a trial solution to control its sample size.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In other words, the essence of the current work is to induce a trial solution with the information about the sample size (for its periodic fitness evaluation) acquired from the fitness variance in its local neighborhood.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The uncertainty problem is resolved here by weighting the size of the objective space covered by a nondominated solution {a mathematical formula}X → with the probability that {a mathematical formula}X → dominates at least one population member.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The integrity of the work lies in the following: (1) adaptive selection of the sample size for the periodic fitness evaluation of a trial solution based on the fitness variance in the subpopulation surrounding it; (2) evaluation of the expected value of the fitness samples of a trial solution based on the nonuniform fitness sample distribution in the entire sample space; and (3) enhancing the robustness in selecting trial solutions from the same-rank candidate pool based on the selection probability influenced jointly by the crowding distance metric and the probability of nonoccurrence of rare (probably noisy) fitness samples.</a>
