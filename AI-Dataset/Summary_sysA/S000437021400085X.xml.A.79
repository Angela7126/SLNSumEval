<a href="#0" id="0">In the full information model, there is always a fixed price{a mathematical formula}pjthat is a best response for vendor j to any strategy profile{a mathematical formula}P − jof the other vendors.If the vendors have full information, then they know exactly which buyer partitions will form given any profile of discounts P. Suppose that vendor j expects to have t buyers under some nontrivial schedule {a mathematical formula}pj.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The best response of j is:{a mathematical formula} Our main result in the Bayesian model is that, assuming buyer types are independent and drawn from the same distribution, a vendor cannot benefit by using a discount schedule instead of a fixed price unless other vendors also use schedules.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">With any fixed price of the form {a mathematical formula}pj=p ⁎ (j)=vj,j ∈ [n] — clearly there is no reason to use any other price — the vendor will achieve revenue of:{a mathematical formula} Thus for any n, we can set Ε sufficiently small so that the revenue from any fixed price is arbitrarily close to 1, whereas the best discount schedule attracts revenue that approaches n. □</a>
