<a href="#1" id="1">The structural interface algorithm, which exploits local structure, successfully performs inference on all of the networks while this is not the case for the standard interface algorithm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, this table indicates that structural_IA works well in case the transition model is complex while the number of variables in the interface is rather limited.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we proposed a new inference algorithm, the structural interface algorithm, for Dynamic Bayesian Networks based on knowledge compilation.</a>
