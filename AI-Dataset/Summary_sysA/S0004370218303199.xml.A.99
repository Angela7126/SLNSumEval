<a href="#0" id="0">This can be explained by the fact that given the number of EVs remains stable and the number of tasks increases, the greedy algorithm already calculates a schedule which covers most of the EVs' availability and for this reason the local search cannot improve the solution a lot.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, it terminates sooner compared to other settings where the space for improvement is larger.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As will be described in Section 7.2, when the Off-Greedy-Swap is combined with the MaxFlow and under some assumptions, it provides the optimal solution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, there was no point to combine the local search with battery swap.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Here we assume the full range of some EVs (i.e., 20% of the available EVs) not to be long enough to execute some of the longer trips.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, the MaxFlow provides the upper limit of all feasible tasks (see more details on this in Section 7.2) (i.e., the Off-Greedy-Swap does not provide the optimal solution any more).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This is an interesting observation which can be explained as follows: 1) as the number of locations increases, the average number of EVs at one location at {a mathematical formula}t=0, decreases and therefore, the probability of an EV being able to execute a future task starting from a given location decreases, and 2) as the number of locations increases, the number of all possible trips increases exponentially, and therefore, EVs tend to spread around too much.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, similarly to the previous point, the probability of an EV being able to execute a future task decreases.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, the optimization of the number and the location of the pick-up and drop-off points is an important problem to be solved by any MoD company [21] as it is related to the cost of a possible MoD deployment (i.e., number and locations of stations), as well as its performance in terms of serviced tasks and profit.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Here, we evaluate our proposed battery swap optimization algorithm against a setting where no such optimization takes place, based on the tasks assigned by the scheduling algorithms to each EV.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In doing so, we assume all EVs to carry the same battery type, which has a discharge rate {a mathematical formula}conj=10 (i.e., at each time point, 10% of the battery is discharged) and the average trip duration to be 2 time points.</a>
