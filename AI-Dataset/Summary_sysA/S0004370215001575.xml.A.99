<a href="#0" id="0">When applied to the problem of finding bounds of invariants — in cases where bounds are of pre-existing research interest — and provided with examples (objects) where existing theory does not suffice to predict the value of the invariant for the example, a program implementing the Dalmatian heuristic will produce a conjecture.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The answer will be found in terms of relations of other numerical invariants of the object.</a>
