<a href="#0" id="0">As an example, our results for preferred semantics show that {a mathematical formula}S ∈ Σ pref satisfies the condition that for each pair of distinct sets A and B from {a mathematical formula}S there is at least one {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A and one {a mathematical formula}b ∈ B such that a and b do not occur together in any set in {a mathematical formula}S. Thus, for instance, {a mathematical formula}S={{a,b},{c,d},{a,c},{b,d}} is part of the signature {a mathematical formula} Σ pref (the argumentation framework consisting of arguments a, b, c, and d and symmetric attacks between a and d, and b and c, respectively, has {a mathematical formula}S as its preferred extensions) while neither {a mathematical formula}S ∪ {{a,d}} nor {a mathematical formula}S ∪ {{b,c}} are.</a>
