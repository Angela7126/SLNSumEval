<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula} Θ (1in).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, the probability of transferring at steps 2 and 4 is {a mathematical formula} Ω (1n2).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, the expected steps after the initialization procedure to generate the optimal Pareto front is {a mathematical formula} Θ ( ∑ i=1n − 1in)= Θ (n3).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By combining the expected running time {a mathematical formula} Θ (n2) of the initialization in Lemma 1, the expected running time of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecomb,0onebit on Weighted LPTNO is {a mathematical formula} Θ (n3).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have proved that the expected running time of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecombonebit/MOEArecombbitwise without crossover on COCZ is {a mathematical formula} Ω (n2)/ Ω (nlnn), which increases from {a mathematical formula} Θ (nlnn) of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecombonebit/MOEArecombbitwise with crossover probability 0.5.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, recombination is crucial for the efficiency of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecombonebit/MOEArecombbitwise on the COCZ problem.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">From the analysis, we can also find that recombination works by accelerating the filling of the Pareto front through recombining diverse optimal solutions found-so-far, as that we have found from the analysis on the Weighted LPTNO problem.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this section, we analyze the expected running time of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecombbitwise on the bi-objective MST problem for the above two tasks, i.e., finding the optimal Pareto front for the bi-objective MST problem with {a mathematical formula}F ⁎ =sconv(F ⁎ ), and finding a 2-approximation of the optimal Pareto front for the general bi-objective MST problem.</a>
