<a href="#0" id="0">SPR problemAn SPR problem is defined by a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,H0 〉 , where L is a plan library and {a mathematical formula}H0 is a set of hypotheses that explain some observation sequence with respect to L. A solution to the SPR problem is an SPR process with a query policy that decides which plans to select in order to reduce the size of {a mathematical formula}H0 with as few queries as possible.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The Entropy policy will choose the plan that minimizes the change in entropy to the updated hypothesis set, weighted by the likelihood that the plan is part of the correct hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As discussed in Appendix B, we can approximate the likelihood that the plan is part of the correct hypothesis – {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ (p) – by choosing a value between {a mathematical formula}Pr(p) and {a mathematical formula}Pm(p).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the Entropy policy, we need to compute for each plan p the entropy of the hypothesis set with and without p. To compute the updated hypothesis set {a mathematical formula} Φ (H,p,True) (Equation (2)) we need to go over all plans in H and check whether they are refinements of p. A naive implementation of checking whether a plan {a mathematical formula}p ′ ∈ H is a refinement of p (Definition 6) is to exhaustively check if there exists a sequence of refinement methods that can be applied to p to obtain {a mathematical formula}p ′ .</a>
