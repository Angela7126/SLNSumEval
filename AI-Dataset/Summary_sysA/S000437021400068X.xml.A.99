<a href="#0" id="0">By slightly abusing the notation, given {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ k ≤ n and any formula Φ , we can use {a mathematical formula}V(Xk, Φ ) to denote {a mathematical formula}V(u, Φ ) for any {a mathematical formula}u ∈ Xk because {a mathematical formula}Xk is an equivalence class of E. Now, as E is the {a mathematical formula}G Δ ( ◇ )-equivalence relation, there exists {a mathematical formula} Ψ k such that {a mathematical formula}V(X1, Ψ k) ≠ V(Xk, Ψ k) for every {a mathematical formula}2 ≤ k ≤ n.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We let {a mathematical formula}ck denote {a mathematical formula}V(X1, Ψ k) and define {a mathematical formula} Φ k= Δ ( Ψ k ↔ ck¯) for {a mathematical formula}2 ≤ k ≤ n and {a mathematical formula} Φ = ⋀ 2 ≤ k ≤ n Φ k.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, because the number of formulas of a logical language is infinite in general, the direct computation of the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation is not effective.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In general, our results show that the computation of {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence can be reduced to the computation of GRE if the query language {a mathematical formula}L is one of the languages mentioned in Theorem 3, Theorem 4; and it can be reduced to the computation of regular similarity if the query language is {a mathematical formula}G( □ ◇ ) or {a mathematical formula}G( ◇ ).</a>
