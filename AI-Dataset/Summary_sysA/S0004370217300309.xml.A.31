<a href="#0" id="0">The first clear trend we observe in these results is that it is possible to converge to a Ε -stable health state without finding all diagnoses even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, consider the convergence rate results when using the AUC metric for system 74181.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Only 17% of the diagnoses are needed to generate a health state that is at most 0.1 far from the health state generated from all diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This suggests that intelligent DAs can halt early without significant loss in health state quality.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Although the proposed online stopping condition is very simple, the results in Table 15, Table 16 show that the resulting values for {a mathematical formula} Δ =0.1 are almost exactly the same as those obtained for health states generated from all diagnoses ({a mathematical formula} Δ =0).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In some cases, the health state obtained by the online stopping condition is even better than the health state of all diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The health state found when using the online stopping is also comparable to the quality obtained by the Ε -stable health state for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 (presented in Table 9, Table 10).</a>
