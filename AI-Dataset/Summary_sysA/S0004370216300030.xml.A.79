<a href="#0" id="0">For the co-occurrence test we need to identify, for each sentence p, a set of reasonably plausible belief sets containing p. We can assume that this set satisfies the following continuity property: If Z is a reasonably plausible p-containing set, and Y is a p-containing set such that {a mathematical formula}Y ≦ Z, then Y is a reasonably plausible p-containing set.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Furthermore, we can assume that {a mathematical formula}K ⁎ p is the ≦ -minimal p-containing set and that it is reasonably plausible.</a>
