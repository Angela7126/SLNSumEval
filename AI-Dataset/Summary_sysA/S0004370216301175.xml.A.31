<a href="#1" id="1">Set of acceptable alternativesLet {a mathematical formula}B ⊆ X be a set of alternatives posed to the agent and {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,C,>C,K, Γ 〉 be the agent's decision framework.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this work we have introduced an argumentative approach to single-agent decision making.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The proposed formalism, called Abstract Decision Framework, was defined as a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,C,>C,K, Γ 〉 and involves: a set X of mutually exclusive alternatives, a set of distinguished literals {a mathematical formula}C where each {a mathematical formula}ci ∈ C represents a different binary preference relation for comparing alternatives in X, a strict total order {a mathematical formula}>C among elements of {a mathematical formula}C, a dynamic argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}K used for representing preferences relations and conflicts among the available alternatives, and a set of decision rules Γ that implements the agent's decision making policy.</a>
