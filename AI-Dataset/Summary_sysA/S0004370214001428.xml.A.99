<a href="#0" id="0">M is an answer set (or stable model) of a program P if M is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}PM.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We denote by {a mathematical formula}AS(P) the set of all answer sets of P.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We observe that {a mathematical formula}Horn ⊊ no-BC by again considering the program {a mathematical formula}P3 which belongs to {a mathematical formula}no-BC, but is obviously not Horn, and by considering the fact that all rules r in a Horn program P satisfy {a mathematical formula}|H(r)| ≤ 1 and {a mathematical formula}B − (r)= ∅ which yields that the dependency graph {a mathematical formula}UP contains no bad vertices and hence gives us that {a mathematical formula}UP contains no bad cycles.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However the obtained kernels are not equivalent with respect to the decision of the problems in {a mathematical formula}AspReason, in consequence the kernel cannot be used for backdoor evaluation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the next subsection we consider kernels with respect to problems in {a mathematical formula}AspReason.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Next we consider the problems in {a mathematical formula}AspReason.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We will see that neither of them admits a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the size of a strong {a mathematical formula}C-backdoor for the considered target classes, subject to standard complexity theoretical assumptions.</a>
