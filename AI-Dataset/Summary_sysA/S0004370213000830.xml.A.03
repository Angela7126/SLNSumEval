<a href="#0" id="0">Our algorithm was among the best performing feature labeling algorithms in the idealized setting and it was also robust to poor quality feature labels provided by ordinary end users in our study.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We evaluate our semi-supervised algorithm using both oracle feature labels and end-user feature labels from the user study mentioned above.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our feature labeling algorithm is one of the best performing algorithms with oracle feature labels and the best performer with lower quality feature labels from end users.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We refer to our semi-supervised algorithm which uses no feature labeling information as LWLR-SS and the one using feature labeling information as LWLR-SS-FL.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The LWLR-SS-FL algorithm incorporates feature labeling into LWLR-SS by using the following similarity measure:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">feature labels on features created by participants were ignored).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Participants were able to provide useful feature labels in our experiments, as can be seen in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our results showed that features provided by end users could improve the accuracy of feature labeling algorithms.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">8 and Table 4 depict the results of adding 10 oracle feature labels per class to the semi-supervised feature labeling algorithms.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As before, we would like to evaluate the semi-supervised feature labeling algorithms using feature labels provided by actual end users rather than using idealized feature labels generated by an oracle.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Much of the past work on semi-supervised feature labeling had evaluated algorithms against oracle feature labels.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Our new supervised LWLR-FL algorithm expands LWLR to take feature labeling into account.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">These results are promising, as they show that end users with no background in machine learning can use feature labeling to significantly improve machine learning algorithms trained on small data sets.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Semi-supervised feature labeling can be effective in some cases, but the unlabeled data may degrade performance if it does not match the algorithm Ê¼ s assumptions.</a>
