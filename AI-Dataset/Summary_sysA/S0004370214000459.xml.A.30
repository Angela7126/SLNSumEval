<a href="#0" id="0">The CNF {a mathematical formula} Ψ n, which contains {a mathematical formula}d ≤ 3|Cn|+1 clauses with {a mathematical formula}m=|Cn| Boolean variables, was then transformed into a set {a mathematical formula} Σ fn of OWL 2 QL-tgds and a Boolean CQ {a mathematical formula}qfn such that{a mathematical formula} Consider now the OWL 2 QL-ontology {a mathematical formula} Σ fn ⁎ that extends {a mathematical formula} Σ fn with the negative constraints{a mathematical formula} where Θ is the set comprising the following formulas:{a mathematical formula} We observe that {a mathematical formula}| Σ fn ⁎ |=O(|Cn|2) and the claims of Lemma 8 are equally applicable to {a mathematical formula} Σ fn ⁎ (the proof requires that the query {a mathematical formula}qfn and the ontology {a mathematical formula} Σ fn/ Σ fn ⁎ give ‘ correct ’ answers only for data {a mathematical formula}D Α which, by definition, are consistent with the negative constraints above).</a>
