<a href="#0" id="0">The throughput of an activity i is defined as the average number of executions of i per time unit, and corresponds to the inverse of the average distance:{a mathematical formula} Analogously, the throughput of a set of activities is the inverse of Λ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A periodic schedule is pair {a mathematical formula} 〈 L, Λ 〉 where Λ is the iteration period and {a mathematical formula}L is a vector containing the start times for the execution 0 of all the activities, i.e.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As an alternative, it is possible to use traditional resource constraints by making the assumption that {a mathematical formula} Β i= Η i, i.e.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">that the end and the start time of an execution {a mathematical formula}(i, Ω ) must be within to the same period.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Formally:{a mathematical formula} Since no activity is scheduled across different periods, the classical cumulative constraint can be used.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Traditional cumulative constraint With the assumption that the activities are scheduled within the period (i.e.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}ei< Λ ), as in the {a mathematical formula}CROSS ⁎ approach, the algorithm proposed achieves the same filtering of a traditional cumulative constraint, i.e.</a>
