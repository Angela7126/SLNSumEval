<a href="#0" id="0">The Jackson – Yariv model is a diffusion model stating that a vertex will receive (adopt) a property p according to the cumulative effect of its neighbors and the ratio of the benefit to the cost of the vertex for adopting p. Suppose that {a mathematical formula}vi is an agent having a default behavior that can be changed in the new behavior p, and that {a mathematical formula}vi has specific cost {a mathematical formula}ci and benefit {a mathematical formula}bi for adopting the behavior p. Then, the Jackson – Yariv model can be expressed by the rule (see [51]):{a mathematical formula} where (1){a mathematical formula}r( ∑ jEj) is a function describing how the number of neighbors of {a mathematical formula}vi affects the benefits to {a mathematical formula}vi for adopting behavior p, (2){a mathematical formula} ∑ jwj ∑ jEj is the fraction of the neighbors of {a mathematical formula}vi having property p, and (3){a mathematical formula}dpJY is a constant representing the probability that the vertex v will adopt the property p. In our experiments we set {a mathematical formula}r( ∑ jEj) to be a logarithmic function normalized by the logarithm of the maximum in-degree {a mathematical formula}dmaxin of the network, and having values within the interval {a mathematical formula}[0.1,2], i.e., {a mathematical formula}r( ∑ jEj)=1.9×ln ⁡ ( ∑ jEj)ln ⁡ (dmaxin)+0.1.</a>
