<a href="#0" id="0">Every action that a BayesAct agent can take (a) has an affective aspect or “ meaning ” ({a mathematical formula}ba in Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The actions of the agent are now expanded to be {a mathematical formula}B={A,Ba}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, {a mathematical formula}Ba gives the affective “ how ” for the delivery “ what ” of an action, A.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} Σ f is a set of parameters governing the strength of our prior beliefs that the identities of client and agent will remain constant over time.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Here we explore the case where two agents know their own self identities (so {a mathematical formula} Β a0=0.001) but do not know the identity of the other agent (so {a mathematical formula} Β c0 is set to the standard deviation of all identities in the database).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Agents take turns acting, and actions are conveyed to the other agent with the addition of some zero-mean normally distributed “ environment ” noise, with standard deviation {a mathematical formula} Σ e.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Agents take turns acting, and actions are conveyed to the other agent with the addition of some zero-mean normally distributed “ environment ” noise, with standard deviation {a mathematical formula} Σ e.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If the client knows the agent identity, it uses no roughening noise ({a mathematical formula} Σ r=0.0), otherwise all agents use {a mathematical formula} Σ r=N − 1/3 where N is the number of samples.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We investigated the COACH system in simulation using an agent with an affective identity of “ assistant ” , and a client with an affective identity of “ elder ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[1.67,0.01, − 1.03]).</a>
