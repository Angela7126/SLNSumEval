<a href="#0" id="0">For any case sample set S, the competence-based empirical weight provides a reference to the degree of case distribution on a competence area represented by A – a sub-set of {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(CB).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For two case sample sets {a mathematical formula}S1,S2 ⊆ CB, we define the competence-based empirical distance between {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a case base of finite size CB and a case sample set{a mathematical formula}S ⊆ CB,{a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(S)is a finite set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since each case c in CB corresponds to a related set – {a mathematical formula}RCB(c) (whereas several cases may correspond to the same related set) the size of {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(CB) must be less, or equal to, the size of the case base.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Again, according to the definition of related closure (Definition 7), for any case sample set {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ CB, {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(S) ⊆ ℜ CB(CB), we have {a mathematical formula}| ℜ CB(S)| ⩽ | ℜ CB(CB)| ⩽ |CB|.</a>
