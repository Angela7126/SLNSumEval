<a href="#0" id="0">The integration of planning and acting functions is a critical issues in the design of a deliberation system.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is important to keep in mind that planning and acting may work in distinct state spaces and action spaces.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One may characterize ideas and approaches for specifying deliberation models for planning and acting into the following categories:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Multiple model approaches use distinct models: an abstract descriptive model for planning and one or several operational models for acting to refine each plan step into skills.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We will focus instead on problems and approaches for the integration of planning in a robot deliberation system.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As we will see next, they offer some advantages in the integration of planning and acting and in plan repair.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The state of the art illustrates a few systems implementing monitoring functions where the knowledge representation link is addressed at the most abstract planning level.</a>
