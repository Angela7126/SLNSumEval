<a href="#0" id="0">We can analyze the deliberation requirements of a robotics application through eight main features: (i) how variable is the environment, (ii) how diverse is the set of tasks, (iii) how rich are the semantics, (iv) how fast are the dynamics of the environments and tasks, (v) how partially observable is the environment (vi) how high is the cost or criticality of the system, (vii) how important are interaction and cooperation with people and/or other robots, and (viii) how autonomous is the robot in carrying out its mission, e.g., choosing and committing to goals.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, temporal planners that rely on timelines, i.e., partially specified evolution of state variables over time, are more flexible in the integration of planning and acting and, in most cases, more expressive, e.g., allowing the reference to instants beyond starting and ending time of actions.</a>
