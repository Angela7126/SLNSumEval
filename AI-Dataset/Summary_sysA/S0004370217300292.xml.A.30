<a href="#1" id="1">Consider the price competition game in the proof of Lemma 4; we repeat it in Table 4.Consider the allocation x where all buyers of type ℓ are assigned to vendor ℓ and all buyers of type r are assigned to vendor r. By applying algorithm CandidatePrice, we obtain the price vector {a mathematical formula}p=(5,5) and the corresponding subsidy vector {a mathematical formula}s(x,p)=(1,1); this amount of subsidies is required so that no vendor has incentive to lower the price to {a mathematical formula}3 − Ε and obtain all buyers and a utility of {a mathematical formula}6 − 2 Ε .</a>
