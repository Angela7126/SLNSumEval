<a href="#0" id="0">If we apply game-theoretic analysis to such systems, then the main questions to be answered about such systems are not just “ what computations might the system produce? ” , but rather, “ what computations might the system produce if the constituent programs act rationally? ” If we interpret acting rationally to mean choosing strategies (for resolving non-determinism) that are in Nash equilibrium, then this question amounts to asking “ which of the possible computations of the system will be produced in equilibrium? ” Further, if we use temporal logic as the language for expressing properties of our multi-agent and concurrent system (as is standard in the computer aided verification community [20]), then we can also interpret this question as “ which temporal logic formulae are satisfied by computations arising from the selection of strategies in equilibrium? ” We refer to this general problem as equilibrium checking[75].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For every action Α we define a propositional formula {a mathematical formula}pre Α , such that this formula is satisfied by a valuation whenever the pre-condition of Α is met:{a mathematical formula} The effect of executing an action Α when the world is as described by the valuation v is denoted {a mathematical formula}eff( Α ,v), where this partial function is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} We can then naturally define a multi-agent STRIPS arena:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}N={1, … ,n} is the set of players, Φ is the vocabulary of propositional variables used to represent the state of the system, {a mathematical formula}v0 ∈ V is the initial state of the game, and for each player {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N, {a mathematical formula}Aci={ Α i1, … , Α ik} is set of action descriptors, representing the actions that i can perform.</a>
