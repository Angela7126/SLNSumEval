<a href="#1" id="1">An embedded coalition is a pair, {a mathematical formula}(C,CS), where C is a coalition, and CS is a coalition structure over A that contains C. That is, {a mathematical formula}CS ∈ Π A:C ∈ CS.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The set of all embedded coalitions will be denoted by EC.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">The coalition structure generation problem is the problem of finding a coalition structure over A whose value is maximal.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Such a coalition structure is said to be “ optimal ” , and is denoted by {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">More specifically, in CFGs, coalition structure generation is the problem of finding {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ ∈ argmaxCS ∈ Π AV(CS), while in PFGs it is the problem of finding {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ ∈ argmaxCS ∈ Π AW(CS).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Every coalition structure in {a mathematical formula}TCS is the result of merging some (if not all) of the coalitions in CS that are connected via solid edges.</a>
