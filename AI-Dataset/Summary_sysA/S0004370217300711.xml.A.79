<a href="#0" id="0">It is not difficult to see that, for all types of axioms considered in this paper except for the {a mathematical formula}DL-Litebool family, all-minas is in conp: given an instance of all-minas, a nondeterministic algorithm can guess a subset of {a mathematical formula}K that is not in {a mathematical formula}K, and in polynomial time verify that this is a MinA, thus proving that {a mathematical formula}K is not the set of all MinAs.</a>
