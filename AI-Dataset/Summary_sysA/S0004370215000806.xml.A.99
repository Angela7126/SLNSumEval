<a href="#1" id="1">When variables are chosen in the order {a mathematical formula}S,T,Y,N,D,E,M,O, the search tree has only 13 nodes and 2 intermediary solutions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the new model, for the diameter and split criteria, instead of using reified constraints, we develop two global constraints diameter{a mathematical formula}(G,D,d) and split{a mathematical formula}(G,S,d), which exploit the measure d and which operate on the array {a mathematical formula}G and on the variable D or S. The filtering algorithms for the three constraints diameter{a mathematical formula}(G,D,d), split{a mathematical formula}(G,S,d) and wcsd{a mathematical formula}(G,V,d) are presented in Section 5.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To represent the relations between points and the diameter or the split, we develop filtering algorithms for two global constraints diameter{a mathematical formula}(G,D,d) and split{a mathematical formula}(G,S,d), which exploit the dissimilarity measure d between any two points and which operate on the array {a mathematical formula}G and the variable D or S. The constraint diameter{a mathematical formula}(G,D,d) ensures that D is the maximal diameter of the clusters formed by the variables {a mathematical formula}G1, … ,Gn.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The lower bound {a mathematical formula}S.lb is either − ∞ or the value of S in the previous solution found, since S is to be maximized.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the same manner as for the constraint diameter{a mathematical formula}(G,D,d), this algorithm is invoked if the lower bound {a mathematical formula}S.lb has been changed or some variables in {a mathematical formula}G have been instantiated.</a>
