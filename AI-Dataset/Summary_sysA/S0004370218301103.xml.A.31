<a href="#0" id="0">Using this definition, a PR algorithm is complete if it returns a hypothesis set H such that {a mathematical formula}h ∼ rh ⁎ → h ∈ H, that is, H contains all possible hypotheses that can be refined to {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A PR algorithm is sound if for every hypothesis {a mathematical formula}h ∈ H → h ∼ rh ⁎ .</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">Query functionA query QA is a function that receives as input a plan p and outputs whether one of the plans in the correct hypothesis {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ can be refined from p.{a mathematical formula}</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">SPR problemAn SPR problem is defined by a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,H0 〉 , where L is a plan library and {a mathematical formula}H0 is a set of hypotheses that explain some observation sequence with respect to L. A solution to the SPR problem is an SPR process with a query policy that decides which plans to select in order to reduce the size of {a mathematical formula}H0 with as few queries as possible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}Subs(P) be the set of all subplans and full plans that are refinements of a plan from the set of plans P. To implement the query process using subplans, we only need to change the query function Π in Algorithm 1 to choose any subplan in {a mathematical formula}Subs(P).</a>
