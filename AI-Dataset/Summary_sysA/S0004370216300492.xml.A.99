<a href="#0" id="0">More generally, we can define a compound concept with prototypical case {a mathematical formula} Θ = ⋀ I±Li, where {a mathematical formula}I ⊆ {1,...,n}, as a triple {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,d, Δ > where:{a mathematical formula}P is therefore a set of points which all have the same values on the dimension specified by the index set I, and cover all remaining possibilities across the dimensions not in I.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This implies that where {a mathematical formula}I={1,...,n}, P is a singleton.</a>
