<a href="#0" id="0">The term ‘ logic ’ is maybe not appropriate for LPML; rather, it is a specific approach to ‘ connect ’ , in a modal object language, a modal formula {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ Lml and a first-order property {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ Lfo1 through the introduction of a relational atom ⊡ (or {a mathematical formula} ⊡ (a → )), in such a way that on Kripke models ⊡ is interpreted as Θ locally.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, we cannot directly apply Lemma 35 to Δ , as it is a set of formulas over {a mathematical formula}AP ∪ Y.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We prove that Δ can nonetheless be extended to a saturated set Φ of formulas over {a mathematical formula}AP ∪ Y.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The proof structure is similar to the one for Lemma 35, namely, we define a sequence {a mathematical formula} Φ 0, Φ 1, … of sets of formulas over {a mathematical formula}AP ∪ Y as follows:{a mathematical formula}We prove by induction on n that every {a mathematical formula} Φ n is consistent (and well-defined).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First of all, {a mathematical formula} Φ 0= Δ is consistent as shown above.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As to the inductive step, suppose that {a mathematical formula} Φ n is consistent.</a>
