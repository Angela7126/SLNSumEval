<a href="#1" id="1">Then, we have{a mathematical formula} Therefore, it suffices to approximate {a mathematical formula}Xt+[Xt+] ⊤ and {a mathematical formula}Xt − [Xt − ] ⊤ since we can store the class means {a mathematical formula}ct+ and {a mathematical formula}ct − in memory.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This section studies the regret bounds when the covariance matrices are approximated.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Recall that the covariance matrices are given by{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Xt+ and {a mathematical formula}Xt − denote the matrices of positive and negative instances, respectively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We try to approximate {a mathematical formula}Xt+[Xt+] ⊤ and {a mathematical formula}Xt − [Xt − ] ⊤ as done in Algorithm 2, Algorithm 3, since it is easy to store the means {a mathematical formula}ct+ and {a mathematical formula}ct − in memory.</a>
