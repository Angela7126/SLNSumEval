<a href="#0" id="0">Therefore, we could not give any examples about the value predicate – for each atom {a mathematical formula}value(x,y) (where x and y range from 1 to 4), there is at least one answer set of {a mathematical formula}B ∪ H that contains {a mathematical formula}value(x,y) and at least one that does not; this means that if {a mathematical formula}value(x,y) is given as either a positive or negative example, H will not be a solution of the task.This means that for any {a mathematical formula}ILPc task {a mathematical formula}Tc such that H is a solution, any subset of the hypothesis space {a mathematical formula}SM is also a solution of {a mathematical formula}Tc.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For instance, in the case of one-to-one-distinguishability we could define the “ noisy ” one-to-one-distinguishability class of a learning framework as the set of tuples {a mathematical formula} 〈 B,H1,H2 〉 , for which there is a set of examples E such that {a mathematical formula}p(H1,E)<p(H2,E), where {a mathematical formula}p(H,E) is the total penalty paid by a hypothesis H (together with the background knowledge B) over the examples E. In fact, we now show that this extended notion of one-to-one-distinguishability class would be equivalent to the standard “ non-noisy ” one-to-one-distinguishability class.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider the programs {a mathematical formula}P1 and {a mathematical formula}P2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} For both programs {a mathematical formula}P1 and {a mathematical formula}P2, the immediate consequences of any interpretation I is the set {a mathematical formula}{p}.</a>
