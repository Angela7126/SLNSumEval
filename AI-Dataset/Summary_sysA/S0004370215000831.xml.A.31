<a href="#1" id="1">The first artificial hierarchy we created had 80 instances, 4 levels, was a balanced tree, and did not have overlapping clusterings.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The ground truth hierarchy for this dataset was therefore always the same.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We can turn the hierarchy into a pairwise distance matrix with the distance between two points a and b being the level of their first common ancestor.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We increased the complexity of this dataset by increasingly adding uniform error to the distances.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We used this data set to evaluate our basic ILP formulation which enforced transitivity (Fig.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">Can our method find overlapping clusters in datasets?</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We evaluated our overlapping clustering formulation against standard hierarchical clustering, using Artificial Dataset 2 and presented the results in Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">8.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We used the same overlapping hierarchy to test how well our expected linear programming results compared to the optimal results found using an ILP solver.</a>
