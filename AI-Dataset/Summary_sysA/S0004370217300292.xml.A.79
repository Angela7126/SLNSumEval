<a href="#0" id="0">In order to verify that {a mathematical formula}(x,p) is indeed a pure Nash equilibrium, it suffices to run algorithm Verify with input {a mathematical formula}(x,p); this is true since all buyers are assigned to vendors in their demand set, vendors 1, 2 and 3 cannot increase their utility by unilaterally increasing their price as, then, they would lose all assigned buyers, while vendor 4 cannot increase its price, since its assigned buyers would move to vendor 1, and cannot attract new buyers by decreasing its price.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since {a mathematical formula}(x,q¯) is not an equilibrium, there must exist some i such that buyers of type i are assigned to a vendor j in x and satisfy {a mathematical formula}vij ′ − q¯j ′ >vij − q¯j for some vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ that is empty in x.</a>
