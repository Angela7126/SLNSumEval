<a href="#0" id="0">For example, if we learn an instance-level model of class 1 in order to obtain {a mathematical formula}f(x → ), then we cannot infer the classification {a mathematical formula}F(X) based only on the individual scores {a mathematical formula}f(x → ), as we find that both positive and negative bags contain instances of class 1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The parameter R is optimized by maximizing the number of positive bags in the training set that contain at least one instance in R and, at the same time, the number of negative bags that do not contain any instance in R. Based on this, the bag-level classifier can be expressed by using the max rule:{a mathematical formula} i.e., X is considered positive if at least one of the instances {a mathematical formula}x → ∈ X is positive.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the methods from the last section tend to discard a big part of the information, by either only modelling the characteristics of certain instances (as in MI-SVM [17], where only one instance per positive bag is considered in the learning stage, see also our technical report [19]), or by considering only the average vector of a positive bag (as in SMIL [20]).</a>
