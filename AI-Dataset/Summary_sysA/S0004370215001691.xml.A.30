<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}FCPSminkLet k and min be strictly positive integers.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The problem of mining Top-k frequent closed patterns in a sequence {a mathematical formula}FCPSmink consists in computing all closed patterns with at least min items such that, for each one, there exist no more than {a mathematical formula}k − 1 closed patterns with at least min items and with supports greater than its support.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The problem of mining Top-k frequent closed patterns in a sequence of itemsets {a mathematical formula}FCPSImink is defined in the same way as {a mathematical formula}FCPSmink.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we introduce a new problem, called Top-k SAT, defined as the problem of enumerating the Top-k models of a propositional formula.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A Top-k model is a model having no more than {a mathematical formula}k − 1 models preferred to it with respect to the considered preference relation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also show that Top-k SAT generalizes the two well-known problems: the Partial MAX-SAT problem and the problem of computing minimal models.</a>
