<a href="#0" id="0">It is important to note that if ∇ is an ES basic fusion operator, restricted to the triple {a mathematical formula}W ⁎ , {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ , N, we can establish analogous results to those presented in Section 4 and Appendix A, adapting their statements to the case where a selected finite society N is chosen, the profiles are restricted N-profiles {a mathematical formula} Φ ⁎ over {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ , integrity constrains E, {a mathematical formula}E ′ are epistemic states in {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ and the interpretations w, {a mathematical formula}w ′ and {a mathematical formula}w ″ are elements in {a mathematical formula}W ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let N be a finite society of agents in {a mathematical formula}S. Define the following set:{a mathematical formula} Since we have (ESF-P), by Observation 3, N is decisive.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, {a mathematical formula}X is nonempty.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let D be an element of {a mathematical formula}X having minimal cardinality.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since D is decisive then {a mathematical formula}D ≠ ∅ , as we noted in Observation 3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, by Proposition 13, it is enough to see that D has a single agent in order to prove that ∇ is dictatorial.</a>
