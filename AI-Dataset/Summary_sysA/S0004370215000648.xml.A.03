<a href="#0" id="0">We consider the problem of learning from a training set of n complex objects {a mathematical formula}{(Ii,Oi)}i=1n, where each object {a mathematical formula}(I,O) is represented as a set of Boolean and rational variables:{a mathematical formula} We indicate Boolean variables using predicates such as {a mathematical formula}touching(i,j), and write rational variables as lower-case letters, e.g.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The feature space representation of an object {a mathematical formula}(I,O) is given by the feature vector{a mathematical formula} Ψ (I,O), which is a function of the constraints.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to encode the set of constraints {a mathematical formula}{ Φ k} that underlie both the learning and the inference problems, it is convenient to first introduce a background knowledge of predicates expressing facts about the relative positioning of blocks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, suppose we have an {a mathematical formula}8×8 image of an upper-case “ A ” , as in Fig.</a>
