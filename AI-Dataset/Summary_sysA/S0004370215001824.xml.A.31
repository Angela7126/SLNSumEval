<a href="#0" id="0">We split our experiments into two parts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first show the performance of ISAC++ on partial MaxSAT instances: a benchmark set of crafted instances, one consisting of industrial instances, and finally a set that contains both crafted and industrial instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the second set of experiments we train solvers for MaxSAT (MS), Weighted MaxSAT (WMS), Partial MaxSAT (PMS), and Weighted Partial MaxSAT (WPMS).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In these datasets we will combine instances from the crafted, industrial and random subcategories.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For each of these benchmark sets we built an instance-specifically tuned MaxSAT solver by applying the ISAC++ methodology.</a>
