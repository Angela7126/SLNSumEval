<a href="#0" id="0">Postponing the computation of alternative contingent branches till more information is acquired from the environment is a more feasible approach for WS scenarios that involve many numeric variables and output-to-input mappings, and being optimistic is likely to be paid off.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, all sources of non-determinism, where the actual behavior of actions at execution time contradicts the expected effects as modeled in the planning domain or external agents alter the world in unanticipated ways, are left to be treated by interleaving planning with execution and performing continual planning as described in Section 4.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Grounding the domain is not a feasible option because of the many input parameters which range over large domains.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, a separate modeling is required, to allow distinguishing between information that refers to input parameters, and enables the planner to make the appropriate output-to-input assignments.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The updated plan (refined or new) is computed starting from an initial state that reflects the new context, and assumes the successful completion of any pending actions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, considering the invocation of the parallel actions {a mathematical formula}Ai at state i, and some actions {a mathematical formula}Ap âŠ† Ai which do not respond within the short time limit, the new initial state is formed by assigning all variables that participate in the effects of {a mathematical formula}Ap to the values they have at the solver state {a mathematical formula}i+1.</a>
