<a href="#0" id="0">In an attempt to improve prediction accuracy, generalized coupled tensor factorization (GCTF) [8], [9] uses social relationships among users as auxiliary information in addition to user – item – tag relationships during the tensor factorization.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A third-order tensor {a mathematical formula}R (definition of main symbols is described in Table 1) is used to model the relationships among objects from sets of users, items, and tags.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For each {a mathematical formula}k ∈ (1 … K), generate an updated feature vector for tag {a mathematical formula}tk, {a mathematical formula}tk ′ , by combining {a mathematical formula}tk with a set of semantically biased feature vectors for {a mathematical formula}tk's classes, {a mathematical formula}{c(K+j)t(i)}j, as follows ({a mathematical formula}(0 ≤ Ε (i) ≤ 1) and {a mathematical formula}(1 ≤ i ≤ X)):{a mathematical formula} This equation indicates that if {a mathematical formula}tk is a sparse tag, {a mathematical formula}tk ′ includes semantic biases from a set of semantically biased feature vectors for {a mathematical formula}tk's classes, {a mathematical formula}{c(K+j)t(i)}j, according to {a mathematical formula}tk's degree of sparsity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, if X is set to three, SSTF makes maximal use of the semantic biases, which are from the features of classes of objects in the most sparse set {a mathematical formula}Vs(1) (or {a mathematical formula}Ts(1)) and the second-most sparse set {a mathematical formula}Vs(2) (or {a mathematical formula}Ts(2)) into features in objects in ({a mathematical formula}Vs(1) and {a mathematical formula}Vs(2) (or {a mathematical formula}Ts(1) and {a mathematical formula}Ts(2)).</a>
