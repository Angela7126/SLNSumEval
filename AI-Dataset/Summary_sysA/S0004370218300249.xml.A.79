<a href="#0" id="0">Current methodologies include learning detailed models of an agent's decision making as well as reasoning about spaces of such models; inferring an agent's goals and plans based on hierarchical action descriptions; recursive reasoning to predict an agent's state of mind and its higher-order beliefs about other agents; and many other approaches.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Surveyed methods include policy reconstruction, which seeks to reconstruct an agent's decision making based on its observed actions; type-based reasoning, which maintains beliefs over a space of alternative decision-making models to identify the most likely models based on observed actions; classification methods, which use machine learning to predict additional properties of interest such as behaviour classes and agent identities; plan recognition, which seeks to identify an agent's goals and plans using hierarchical action descriptions or domain models; recursive reasoning, which predicts an agent's actions by modelling its beliefs and the beliefs it ascribes to other agents; graphical models, which utilise graph structures to represent detailed dependence relations in an agent's decision making; and group modelling, in which models make joint predictions about a group of agents rather than single agents.</a>
