<a href="#0" id="0">We can now define a STPUD planning problem P as a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 V,I,T,A,G 〉 where:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Intuitively, an element {a mathematical formula} 〈 t,a,d 〉 indicates the start of an instance of the action a at time t, with duration d if a is a controllable action.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, plan {a mathematical formula} Π lb is not a valid strong plan.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this section, we present our compilation technique, which can be used to reduce any planning instance P having duration uncertainty into a temporal planning instance {a mathematical formula}P ′ in which all actions have controllable durations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The compilation of the {a mathematical formula}trans action is depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula} The resulting simplified problem now has one uncontrollable action and one controllable action, without any additional variables or conditions.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Consider a plan Σ for R, with actions {a mathematical formula}ai at time {a mathematical formula}ti and having duration {a mathematical formula}di.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Analogously, we call {a mathematical formula} Σ Π the projection plan for R of a strong plan Π for P obtained by fixing the duration of each uncontrollable action in Π to its maximum.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let Π be a strong plan for P. {a mathematical formula} Σ Π is a valid temporal plan for R because:</a>
