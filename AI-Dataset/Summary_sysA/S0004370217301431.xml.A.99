<a href="#0" id="0">Similarly, we cannot start {a mathematical formula}b2 within {a mathematical formula}(t+l,t+u] because there is no guarantee that {a mathematical formula}p2 will be T during {a mathematical formula}(t+l,t+u] (this is because a may take the maximum duration u and thus {a mathematical formula}e3 that sets {a mathematical formula}p2=T will not happen until {a mathematical formula}t+u).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, compiling away disjunctive conditions as in temporal planning leads to incompleteness (some valid plans cannot be found) when actions with uncontrollable duration are present.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For this reason, it is important to explicitly model disjunctive conditions in our language.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Building a strong plan Σ from a strong schedule for the TNU is analogous to the plain temporal planning case: each pair of corresponding {a mathematical formula} 〈 siast,sjaet 〉 ∈ Χ is a step of Σ , the time for the step is {a mathematical formula} Μ (siast) and, if a is controllable, the duration is {a mathematical formula} Μ (sjaet) − Μ (sjast).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, we present our compilation technique, which can be used to reduce any planning instance P having duration uncertainty into a temporal planning instance {a mathematical formula}P ′ in which all actions have controllable durations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the translated instance R, all the conditions are also satisfied because the conditions are imposed via the Χ function that only checks that both the variable and its shadow fulfill the original condition.No conflicting effects are possible because of the conditions added in {a mathematical formula}Ca ′ E that prevents any modification of the interested shadow variables during the uncertainty intervals.Similarly, let</a>
