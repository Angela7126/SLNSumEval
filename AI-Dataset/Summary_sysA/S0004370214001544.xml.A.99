<a href="#0" id="0">By varying the initial conditions and the context, envisioning reasons about the generality (or the limitations) of a plan which could have been generated using classical and motion planning methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, envisioning provides supplementary reasoning capabilities that go beyond simple predictions, enabling robots to know what could happen when they themselves perform a task within a given context.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The aim of this work is not to realize this control mechanism, but rather to acquire the commonsense knowledge and generate the models that can be used within reasoning components.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As will be shown later, we generate a model in form of a decision tree to determine the tilt angle of the container when pouring the pancake mix based on a desired pancake size and a given task context.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">There are three ways of asserting an entity: either by naming the entity, if it is already known by the knowledge base including its physical specifications that are needed by the simulator; by providing the physical specifications of a previously unknown entity explicitly; or by providing an object type that can be generated by the object model factory.envision(Scenario, Plan(Params), Timeline)performs a simulation-based temporal projection for an asserted scenario and a fully instantiated robot control program/plan, and returns an ID of the projected timeline.</a>
