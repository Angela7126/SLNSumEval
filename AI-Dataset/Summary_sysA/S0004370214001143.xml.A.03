<a href="#3" id="3">As with the algorithmic teaching guidance in Experiment 1, we observe that heuristic teaching guidance is more effective in getting humans to provide more useful examples in the sub-condition with {a mathematical formula}r=8, where the optimal teaching sequence is longer (Fig.</a>
