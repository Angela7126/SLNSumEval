<a href="#0" id="0">The downside to such a strategy is that often only a single cut is added at each separation round whereas it may be more efficient to find several cuts at once.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We therefore outline a different method of identifying cuts to add, based on directly identifying any cycles in the graph encoded by the current relaxed solution and then adding cluster cuts ruling each of them out.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As the relaxed solution, by definition, has the integrality constraint on variable values relaxed, it may contain variables which have fractional values.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The presented methods will always find an optimum BN given sufficient time and computational resources.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It therefore makes little sense to evaluate the score of the network found or the similarity of this network to the true one as this is simply evaluating how well optimisation of the score works; the same results would be found for all variants of the ILP technique, as well as for any other exact optimising technique such as [11] or [12].</a>
