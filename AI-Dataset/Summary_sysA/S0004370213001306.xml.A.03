<a href="#1" id="1">In this section, we formally define the weighted synergy graph and how it is used to compute the performance of a team of agents at a task.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The weighted synergy graph is a tuple {a mathematical formula}(G,C), where:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The synergy of a team {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ A depends critically on the capabilities of the agents in A, and the pairwise distances between them.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">4 shows an example of a weighted synergy graph with five agents in a rescue task.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The team {a mathematical formula}{a1,a2,a3} (the agents in the ambulance) has a synergy of {a mathematical formula}C{a1,a2,a3} ∼ N(17.8,2.8).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Using the weighted synergy graph model and the synergy equations, we can compute the synergy of a team of agents {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ A.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The minimum and maximum pairwise distance between vertices in the weighted synergy graph (excluding pairs of the selected team {a mathematical formula}Anext) are computed, as well as the maximum and minimum agent capabilities (excluding the agents in {a mathematical formula}Anext).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this section, we contribute our learning algorithm that learns a weighted synergy graph using only observations of the performance of teams of agents in {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We will use the example weighted synergy graph and the team {a mathematical formula}{a1,a2} to explain how the matrices are set.</a>
