<a href="#0" id="0">Compared with other famous non-parametric methods, our detection method demonstrates the following advantages: 1) it can be easily adopted in multi-dimensional data while maintaining similar results in one-dimensional data; 2) it is more stable and achieves better results as shown in experiments, especially for small samples, because data can share distribution contributions among related competence areas, rather than splitting strictly by cutting edges, which makes it more tolerable to sample bias; 3) it is able to describe the detected changes by highlighting some competence areas, which is testified by a real world application.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We therefore propose two new competence models – Competence Closure and Related Closure[33], because current competence models are not sufficient for concept drift detection purposes, although, with existing competence models, one can transfer the infinite case domain into a finite domain of related sets, which solves one difficulty of measuring the statistical distance between two case samples.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From a practical point of view, this means that all cases in sample S are equally important with regard to the contribution to the density of elements in {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(S), no matter what their related sets are.</a>
