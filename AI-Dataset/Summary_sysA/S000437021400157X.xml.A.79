<a href="#0" id="0">Incremental means that the semantic map building process does not have to wait for the sensor data of some scene or environment to be complete (no matter how such completeness would have to be defined and determined), but has to start right away, based on individual sensor takes, such as single RGB-D frames or 3D laser scans.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The approach detailed in this paper combines a number of techniques that make it suitable for being used in on-line, incremental semantic mapping, starting from a stream of RGB-D frames: meshing of 3D points and referring to geometric features are used to compensate sensor noise and aperture limitations, and early closed-loop usage of the semantic knowledge is used to generate object hypotheses for guiding low-level sensor data processing.</a>
