<a href="#0" id="0">To this end, we can use a sliding time-based window function {a mathematical formula} Τ 4.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Window {a mathematical formula}S1 is shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">LARS extends propositional logic for streaming data by employing any window function w (Definition 3) in a window operator {a mathematical formula} ⊞ w.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If w is a window function, we call {a mathematical formula} ⊞ w a window operator.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}S=(T, Υ ) be a stream, i.e., the input stream or a window, and {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T be a time point.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let P be a program, D be a data stream and {a mathematical formula}t ∈ N.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">data stream D and a time point t has polynomial size and can be verified in polynomial space; the {a mathematical formula}PSpace-hardness is again inherited from model checking for LARS formulas (see Appendix).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From Theorem 10 we immediately obtain the {a mathematical formula}P-membership of model checking for LARS formulas with bounded window nesting in Theorem 8.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If we apply a further time-based window on {a mathematical formula}S ′ , we obtain another stream of this form.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It thus follows that the answer set of {a mathematical formula} Δ D(Q) corresponds to the answer stream of {a mathematical formula} Δ L(Q).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">By dropping temporal information, any window function w in CQL is captured in LARS by a window operator {a mathematical formula} ⊞ w, followed by ◇ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">That is to say, we control at which time T the window {a mathematical formula} ⊞ +5 is selected, where T itself is inferred information.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The data complexity of LARS formulas and LARS programs (i.e., the formula Α respectively the program P is fixed and just varying the data stream D and the time point t is varied) coincides with the one of ground LARS formulas {a mathematical formula} Α − (respectively programs {a mathematical formula}P − ), as shown in Table 1.</a>
