<a href="#1" id="1">In the first phase we take all unit clauses from {a mathematical formula}¬C Φ and perform unit resolutions only over the variables from {a mathematical formula}C Φ .In the second phase we continue with refutation proof without using unit clauses from {a mathematical formula}¬C Φ and we do not resolve over variables from {a mathematical formula}C Φ at all.Let us now assume that</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}D1 ′ , … ,Dm ′ = ⊥ is a unit refutation proof which proceeds in the above two phases.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since it is a unit refutation proof, it can be observed that {a mathematical formula}m ⩽ s.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let us assume that the first phase is formed by clauses {a mathematical formula}D1 ′ , … ,Dk ′ − 1 ′ and the second phase is formed by clauses {a mathematical formula}Dk ′ ′ , … ,Dm ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Each clause among {a mathematical formula}D1 ′ , … ,Dk ′ − 1 ′ is therefore either a clause in {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ or it originates from two preceding clauses by unit resolution over variable from {a mathematical formula}C Φ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Similarly each clause among {a mathematical formula}Dk ′ ′ , … ,Dm ′ is either an original clause from Φ or it originates from two preceding clauses by unit resolution over a variable which is not in {a mathematical formula}C Φ .</a>
