<a href="#0" id="0">We propose an optimal Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation of the problem of scheduling EVs in a MoD scheme that maximizes the number of completed tasks (i.e., trip requests from consumers) or the EV utilization (i.e., number of time points each EV is travelling), either using battery swap or battery charging at each station.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given that an EV changes location only after executing a task, for each location k and time point t, the number of tasks that started from k any time point prior to t, must be less or equal to the tasks that ended at k any time point prior to t, plus the EVs whose initial location was equal to k (i.e., no task can be executed without the existence of at least one EV).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, a task can be executed if and only if at least one EV exists at {a mathematical formula}kistart the time point {a mathematical formula}tidep.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that in case the max flow algorithm returns the optimal set of tasks to be executed, this algorithm simply calculates the EV to task execution schedule.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, at time point {a mathematical formula}t=0, all EVs must be at their initial locations (Equation (17)), which also means that no tasks are executed at {a mathematical formula}t=0.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The intuition behind this algorithm is the following: Given that the dimension of the problem that affects the execution time the most is the number of EVs (see Section 7.1), we solve the MIP problem for each EV separately.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the case of our MIP formulation, the solver finds the optimal schedule for EVs that maximises the number of tasks executed, or the EV utilization.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the case where the number of EVs is lower than the number of the remaining tasks, we need to carefully choose which of the tasks need to be executed in the current time point, so that more tasks can be executed in the future.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the case of battery charge, we also plot the execution time of the greedy algorithm in combination with the local search technique.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, in contrast to battery swap, for large number of tasks the Off-Incr-Charge has higher execution time compared to Off-Greedy-Charge-LS.</a>
