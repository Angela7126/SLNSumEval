<a href="#0" id="0">However, we were not able to pinpoint a simple explanation for this behavior, which we in fact believe to be due to a combination of (i) the intrinsically randomized search heuristics applied within the solvers (local search), (ii) the benchmark set being to some extent more heterogeneous than (e.g., in the recent SAT Competitions before SC 2012, the random tracks did not include instances for clause lengths {a mathematical formula}k=4,6), and (iii) in combination with point (ii), some of the solvers appeared to have been tuned to perform mainly on random instances generated using very similar parameter value combinations as the ones used in the recent SAT Competitions, witnessed e.g.</a>
