<a href="#0" id="0">The analysis of the case where bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information is an instance of the case where the auctioneer needs to calculate her expected-benefit-maximizing strategy given the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, as given in Section 3.2, for {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= âˆ… .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The figure depicts the auctioneer's expected benefit as a function of the information cost, for the setting given in the following table:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">5 depicts the equilibrium's expected benefit for the auctioneer and bidders and the expected social welfare as a function of the cost of the external information, for different numbers of bidders.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Nevertheless, since the cost at which the transition between purchasing the information to not purchasing it also increases as n increases, it is possible that for some costs, with {a mathematical formula}n1 bidders the information is not purchased in equilibrium and with {a mathematical formula}n2>n1 the information is purchased in equilibrium, yielding to the auctioneer an expected benefit lower than the one obtained for {a mathematical formula}n1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">5 for cost {a mathematical formula}C=23.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this case the expected benefit of the auctioneer with 5 bidders is greater than her expected benefit with {a mathematical formula}n=6.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Taking the case of {a mathematical formula}N=6 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">5, if the cost of purchasing the information is {a mathematical formula}C<6 then the auctioneer's expected benefit is greater than the one resulting from not having the option to purchase the information in the first place.</a>
