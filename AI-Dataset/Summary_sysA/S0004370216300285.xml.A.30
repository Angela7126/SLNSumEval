<a href="#0" id="0">In order to obtain positive formal results about the convergence of SM-MCTS-like algorithms, the authors in [59] either add an additional averaging step to the algorithm (that makes it significantly slower in practical games used in benchmarks), or assume additional non-trivial technical properties about the selection function, which are not known to hold for any of the selection functions above.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In iterative deepening, the algorithm by default starts at depth {a mathematical formula}d=1 and gradually increases d until there is no more time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In our implementation of iterative deepening we follow a natural observation that saves the computation time between different searches: a solution computed in state s by player i to depth d contains an optimal solution on {a mathematical formula}d − 1 approximation of subgames starting in possible next states {a mathematical formula}T(s,r,c), where r is the action selected for the player performing the search and c is the action of the opponent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, when the iterative deepening algorithm starts a new search in state {a mathematical formula}s ′ ∈ T(s,r,c), it can often begin at depth d. This can require space exponential in the depth d in the worst case, but it is beneficial in practical experiments.</a>
