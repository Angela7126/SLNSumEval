<a href="#0" id="0">The extended SimStudent first acquires the representation of the problems using the deep feature learner.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Integrating the deep feature learner into the original SimStudent both reduces the amount of engineering effort and builds a better model of student learning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that the extended SimStudent with better representation learning performs much better than the original SimStudent when neither of them are given domain-specific knowledge.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">SimStudent is given a set of (ideally simple) feature predicates and a set of (ideally simple) operator functions as prior knowledge before learning.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Having reviewed SimStudent's production rule learning mechanisms, we move to a discussion of representation knowledge acquisition as deep feature learning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In order to achieve effective learning, we further extended the feature learner to support transfer learning within the same domain and across domains.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Learning with feature focus is an example of using a better learning strategy during knowledge acquisition.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In all but the last task, each learner was given 10 training problems, which are enough for each learner to acquire the representation knowledge in the learning task.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In contrast, the feature learner acquires deep features that are essential for effective learning without requiring prior knowledge engineering.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The extended SimStudent is first trained on a sequence of deep feature learning tasks, which include learning what is a signed number, what is a term, and what is an expression.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">If the discovered model turns out to be a good cognitive model, we should be able to conclude that the extended SimStudent simulates the real student learning process well.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Additionally, the deep feature learning process is currently carried out before the SimStudent knowledge acquisition.</a>
