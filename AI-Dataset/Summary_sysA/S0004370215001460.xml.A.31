<a href="#0" id="0">We assume a linear model for the generation of true AOD values, corrupted by a stochastic process as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}w ∈ RD is a weight vector, and {a mathematical formula} Ε i is a regression error due to zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance {a mathematical formula} Σ 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then, we can say that the target values {a mathematical formula}yi are sampled from the following Gaussian distribution,{a mathematical formula} Further, we assume that data points are independent and identically distributed (IID), and that expert predictions for the ith data point are sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution as{a mathematical formula} This assumption allows the experts to be correlated (i.e., {a mathematical formula} Σ K is non-diagonal), as is the case in practice in the aerosol domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We will first consider a case where all experts are available, and then extend the methodology to account for missing experts.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given {a mathematical formula}D, the objective is to learn {a mathematical formula} Σ K, w, and {a mathematical formula} Σ 2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For conciseness, in the following by {a mathematical formula} Θ ={ Σ K,w, Σ 2} we denote a set of parameters to be learned in a training phase.</a>
