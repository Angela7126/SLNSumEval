<a href="#0" id="0">Intuitively, to calculate a cutoff, we require that each agent in the cutoff system, referred to by the atomic propositions and epistemic modalities in the trivial instantiation of an {a mathematical formula}m¯-indexed formula, is able to make any transition that the agent can make in any bigger system.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This will enable us to establish that the cutoff system {a mathematical formula}m¯-stuttering simulates every bigger system.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By Theorem 3.9 we can then conclude that if the cutoff system satisfies a formula then the formula is satisfied by every bigger system.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider an agent {a mathematical formula}(i,j) indexing an atomic proposition or an epistemic modality in the trivial instantiation of an {a mathematical formula}m¯-indexed formula and a transition by means of a multi-role action of agent {a mathematical formula}(i,j) that is guarded by agent {a mathematical formula}(r,q).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To show the simulation requirements (i) and (iii), assume that {a mathematical formula}g ∼ m¯ssg ′ for an arbitrary pair of global states in {a mathematical formula}G(c¯)×G(n¯).</a>
