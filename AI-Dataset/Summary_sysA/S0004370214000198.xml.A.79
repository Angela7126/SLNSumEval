<a href="#0" id="0">The action subsequence from Lemma 2 applies action {a mathematical formula}u21 in the partial state {a mathematical formula}{a,b¯,x}, in which no action on {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} is applicable, making it impossible for any plan to change the value of a variable in {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} after {a mathematical formula}u21.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Another direct consequence of Lemma 2 is that the variables in {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} have to be false in the initial state; we can therefore say that a loop instance U has implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}U¯.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This corresponds to solving the partial planning problem {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ , which has implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}V¯i+1 ′ since variables in {a mathematical formula}{ai+1,bi+1,xi+1} have to be false for {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ to be solvable due to Lemma 2 and, if {a mathematical formula}i+1<n, we recursively have to satisfy the implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}V¯i+2 ′ of {a mathematical formula}Pi+2 ′ to apply the action pair {a mathematical formula}(u(i+1)01,u(i+1)11) while {a mathematical formula}bi+1 is false.Let {a mathematical formula} Ω i+1 be a plan solving {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">He did not prove a result for a bounded number k of preconditions, but conjectured that plan existence falls into the polynomial hierarchy in a regular way, with the precise complexity determined by k. In this section we modify our previous reduction such that actions have at most two preconditions, thus showing that plan existence is PSPACE-complete for {a mathematical formula}k=2 and proving Bylander's conjecture to be wrong.</a>
