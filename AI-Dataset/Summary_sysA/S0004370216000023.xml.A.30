<a href="#0" id="0">that not all TRPMMCs are spheres filtration-based multiple contractions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, in the following counterexample we present a transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction function ÷ on a belief set K which is different from the {a mathematical formula}S filtration-based multiple contraction {a mathematical formula}÷S, for any system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In what follows we present some definitions of multiple contraction functions on a belief set K which are based on a system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Throughout this subsection we assume that K is a belief set, {a mathematical formula}S is a system of spheres centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ and {a mathematical formula}÷S1 and {a mathematical formula}÷S2 are the multiple contraction functions whose definitions we have introduced in the previous subsection.</a>
