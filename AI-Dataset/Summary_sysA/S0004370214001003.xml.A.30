<a href="#0" id="0">By modelling appliances as hidden Markov models (HMMs), we learn a general appliance behavioural model which will generalise to previously unseen households.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We then use an unsupervised method by which these general appliance models can be tuned to the specific appliance instances in a previously unseen household using only aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, in this section we propose a method for learning such behaviour that is unique to a single household, which uses both general appliance models and household aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">More formally, this tuning process directly corresponds to learning the parameters {a mathematical formula} Θ (n) for an appliance instance n in a household, given the appliance type's general model Θ and the household's aggregate data x.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Once the signatures of a single appliance instance have been extracted from aggregate data, the aim is to tune the general model to include the behaviour of the appliance instance which is unique to the previously unseen household.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given that both the general model for this appliance type, Θ , and signatures sampled from the specific appliance instance are available, {a mathematical formula}x¯i:j, Bayesian integration [15] provides a natural approach to infer the posterior distribution over such appliance instance parameters with the state sequence marginalised out:{a mathematical formula} Therefore, we update the general model again using variational message passing as described in Appendix A.</a>
