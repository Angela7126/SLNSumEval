<a href="#0" id="0">Highly trained physical reasoning, such as catching a fly ball or predicting the trajectory of a billiard ball with spin, probably also involves interpolation from a database of stored examples, derived from personal experience combined with using a tight perception-action feedback loop, learned using reinforcement learning or some similar strategy.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">With the many examples that we have reviewed in this paper, we hope to have made clear that the full-simulation view of cognition is entirely unrealistic and by the same token that simulation, however precise, is equally unlikely to solve the problems of automated commonsense physical reasoning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, although we have suggested that simulation is effective for physical reasoning when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of spatial or temporal scale involved is moderate, in many other cases simulation is to some extent problematic.</a>
