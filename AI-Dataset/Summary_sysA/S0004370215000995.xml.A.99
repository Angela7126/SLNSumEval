<a href="#0" id="0">When dealing with an MOP with many objectives, Pareto dominance often loses its effectiveness to differentiate individuals [57], which makes most individuals in a population become incomparable in terms of proximity (e.g., in NSGA-II most individuals fall into the first layer).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consequently, the density-based selection criterion will play a decisive role in determining the survival of individuals during the evolutionary process, leading to the individuals in the final population distributed widely over the objective space but far from the desired Pareto front [85].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The bi-goal evolution is implemented with two specific methods of estimating individuals' performance (i.e., proximity and crowding degree), and also with simple individual comparison strategies in the mating and environmental selection.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the two combinatorial optimization problems, since the range of their Pareto front is unknown, we set the reference point slightly worse than the boundary values of the nondominated set with respect to the mixed population consisting of all the obtained solutions; that is, the points with 13,000 and 22 for each objective (i.e., {a mathematical formula}r=13,000m and {a mathematical formula}r=22m) are fixed for the knapsack and TSP problems, respectively.</a>
