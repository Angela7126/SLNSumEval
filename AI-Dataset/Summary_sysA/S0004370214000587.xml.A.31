<a href="#0" id="0">One method for solving this puzzle is this: from this set of candidates, we may form the fractal representations from the fractal encoding of the transformation of each candidate image X in terms of image C.{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} This provides a set of possible transformations, which we shall label Ω , from which to seek the most analogous transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ and thereby find which candidate image was responsible for it.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this example, the problem is to determine for which of the candidate images the transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ is made most analogous to transformation T. We first will represent T as a fractal representation, and then generate a set of candidate transformations Ω as shown in Fig.</a>
