<a href="#0" id="0">The same holds for the case of {a mathematical formula}Dodgsonk-SP societies, by the work of Erdélyi et al.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For the case of {a mathematical formula}PerceptionFlipk-SP societies it suffices to give a polynomial-time algorithm that does the following.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a vote v and a societal axis L, both over the same set of candidates, the algorithm finds the smallest number of (sequential) swaps of adjacent candidates so as to transform L into {a mathematical formula}L ′ such that v is single-peaked with respect to {a mathematical formula}L ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">(The {a mathematical formula}k=0 case of this result follows from Faliszewski et al.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus {a mathematical formula}A ″ must contain exactly k candidates from A.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}r ″ ⩽ r ′ ,</a>
