<a href="#0" id="0">It has been shown that matrix-factorization-based CF methods usually fail to make confident predictions on the items (or users) for a specific user (or item), whose historical ratings are rare.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, the items (or users) of the most uncertain predictions in the target recommender system tend to be in the tail with high probabilities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, since we assume the source and the target recommender systems be similar, if the items (or users) are in the tail in the target system, then their correspondences tend to be in the tail in the source system as well.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This implies that the predictions on the corresponding entities in the source system may not be precise either, resulting in limited knowledge transferred through the extended matrix factorization method.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, besides focusing on prediction uncertainty, we need to take the long tail issue into consideration when designing an active entity selection strategy for building cross-system correspondences.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The proposed error-based active learning approach thus aims to select a set of queries {a mathematical formula}Q at each iteration to construct K more correspondences between the source and the target system in addition to the existing set of correspondences such that the resulting new CF model obtains lower generalization error than any other set of queries {a mathematical formula}Q â€² of K correspondences construction, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}C is the set of cross-system correspondences used in the current CF model, which can be empty.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that when the proportion of entity correspondences equals to 0, the proposed active transfer learning approaches, {a mathematical formula}MMMFTL, {a mathematical formula}RLMFTL, and {a mathematical formula}PMFTL, are reduced to the NoTransf methods without correspondences, i.e., MMMF, RLMF, and PMF using the target domain data only, respectively.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As the matrix factorization on the source system data can be pre-trained, the reported computational time does not include the time on generating {a mathematical formula}U(s) and {a mathematical formula}V(s) for the source system.</a>
