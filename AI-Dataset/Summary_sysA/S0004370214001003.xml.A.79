<a href="#0" id="0">This metric represents the likelihood of the test data, x, given a general appliance model, Θ , with both the appliance states z and parameters Θ integrated out, as given by:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}p(x,z| Θ ) is calculated using Eq.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">More formally, this tuning process directly corresponds to learning the parameters {a mathematical formula} Θ (n) for an appliance instance n in a household, given the appliance type's general model Θ and the household's aggregate data x.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This threshold is set such that the model will accept windows of data which can be explained by a set of appliance parameters drawn from the given appliance type's general model, and reject any windows of data generated by other appliance types or combinations of appliances.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the AT method, the vast majority of the time was required to search for windows of aggregate data which could be explained by the general appliance models with a relatively high likelihood, while only a small amount of time was required to update the general models using the extracted signatures.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also developed a method by which general appliance models can be tuned to the specific appliance instances in a household given only aggregate data as would be collected by a smart meter.</a>
