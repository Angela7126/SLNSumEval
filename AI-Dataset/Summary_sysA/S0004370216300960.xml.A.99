<a href="#0" id="0">We have already seen that, without observations, the regression formula contains only variables relevant to the regressed formula.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, the regression of observations that were received throughout the execution of an action sequence may involve variables that appear in {a mathematical formula} Ω a,o, yet are not relevant for any primitive proposition in Φ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Recall that, earlier, we defined observation o resulting from action a as being relevant to p if {a mathematical formula} Ω a,o contains an atomic proposition relevant to p.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is not surprising that when verifying the validity of Φ , we can ignore observations that are irrelevant to l. To model the removal of irrelevant observations, we define, for every action a, a new artificial action {a mathematical formula}ano-obs, identical to a except that {a mathematical formula}obs(a)=(true,no-obs).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The time and space complexity of determining whether some literal l is valid following{a mathematical formula}a¯,o¯is{a mathematical formula}O(2cw ⋅ |a¯| ⋅ poly(|bIa¯,o¯|)), where{a mathematical formula}w=wa¯ ′ cis the contextual causal width of l with respect to the set of actions in{a mathematical formula}a¯ ′ , the determinized sequence of actions executed, and{a mathematical formula}|bIa¯,o¯|is the size of the initial state formula conjoined with regressed, past observations, and converted into PI form or some other form supporting polynomial time validity checks.This follows immediately from Theorem 8 after we notice that the regressed formula will only contain causally relevant variables that appear in the determinized sequence {a mathematical formula}a¯ ′ , as we no longer need to regress through o.</a>
