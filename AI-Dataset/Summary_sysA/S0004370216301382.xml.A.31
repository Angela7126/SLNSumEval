<a href="#0" id="0">The comparative results of CCEHC and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors DistUP, Dist and CCLS on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and four real-world application WPMS benchmarks are summarized in Table 4.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">According to the empirical results presented in Table 4, although CCEHC performs slightly slower than CCLS on the benchmark of advanced encryption standard and performs slightly slower than DistUP and Dist on the benchmark of cluster expansion, it is very apparent that, among these four competing SLS algorithms, our CCEHC algorithm performs best on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and two real-world application WPMS benchmarks (i.e., ‘ Computational Protein Design ’ and ‘ Pedigree ’ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Particularly, the related experimental results indicate that our CCEHC algorithm is able to return better-quality solutions compared to CCLS, Dist and DistUP on a large number of real-world application instances.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In fact, SLS algorithms are considered to be ineffective on solving industrial WPMS instances and real-world application instances, so it is very difficult to improve such performance of SLS algorithms on these benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Time to activate the hard clause weighting scheme: The CCEHC algorithm activates the hard clause weighting scheme when there is no HCSCCD variable, while Dist does that when no decreasing variable exists.</a>
