<a href="#2" id="2">Agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms take as input a distance function and create a dendrogram, which is a tree structure which can be interpreted as a k-block set partition for each value of k between 1 and n, where n is the number of data points to cluster.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">Our contributions are formulating hierarchical clustering as an optimization problem, hence we begin our experiments with the question: 1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Does our global optimization formulation of hierarchical clustering provide better results than greedy algorithms?</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our results in Table 3, Table 4 show that our method outperforms standard hierarchical clustering for real world language evolution and fMRI data sets for finding the best hierarchy (matching the ground truth).</a>

<a href="#11" id="11">6, and they shows our method's ability to outperform many standard agglomerative clustering algorithms for standard hierarchical clustering (no overlapping clusters) on artificial data (Artificial Dataset 1).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The results show that our algorithm performs better when there is increasing distance error which is expected since agglomerative algorithms are greedy and erroneous steps cannot be undone.</a>
