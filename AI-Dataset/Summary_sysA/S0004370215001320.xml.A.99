<a href="#0" id="0">Therefore, the approach employed depends on the complexity of the activity and several challenges must be addressed, including automatically segmenting the observed human motions, identifying the important features of motions, determining the importance of the object(s) for the task, and defining different levels of abstraction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, relevant parameters are identified to reproduce motions similar to those made by the demonstrator, while similar motions can be adjusted based on the parameterization of the given goal, where the goals are generally provided manually in this case, i.e., the system (robot) will not be able to extract the meaning of the action because they do not possess reasoning capabilities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">[40] introduced a system that can understand actions based on their consequences, e.g., split or merge, but the core of this technique relies on a robust active tracking and segmentation method, which can detect changes in the manipulated object, its appearance, and its topological structure, i.e., the consequences of the action.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is a very complex problem since these techniques need to segment the continuous stream of human behavior and object information into meaningful classifications, preferably online.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, we propose a method that automatically identifies the semantics of human behaviors, which involves finding meaningful relationships between human motions and object properties in order to understand the activity performed by humans, i.e., the semantic representations are used to interpret a visual input to understand human activities.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this study we proposed a method for extracting the meaning of basic human activities by combining hand motion information and two object properties.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By adding new capabilities to the reasoning engine, we showed that it could compute new relationships between objects and activities, thereby improving the dynamic growth of the knowledge base in a meaningful manner, which is necessary because we cannot guarantee that knowledge stored manually in the system will be valid under different constraints/scenarios.</a>
