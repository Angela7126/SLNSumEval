<a href="#1" id="1">[27] proposed to figure out a log-optimal (Kelly) portfolio based on similar price relatives, which clearly follows the Capital Growth Theory.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a similarity set, the log-optimal utility function is defined as,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Pi denotes the probability assigned to the similar price relative {a mathematical formula}xi,i ∈ C(x1t).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Györfi et al.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">[27] assumes a uniform probability among the similar samples, thus it is equivalent to the following utility function,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The second category mainly consists of the pattern matching-based algorithms.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It models next price relatives as the average of a sampled set of similar price relatives.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Denoting the similar index set as {a mathematical formula}Ct, it models the next price relative as {a mathematical formula}xi,i ∈ Ct with a uniform probability of {a mathematical formula}1|Ct|.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The algorithms in this category (except CORN) have been proved universal consistency, and their empirical results show that such assumption can fit the market well.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To consider entire price relatives rather than a window, the second type, “ Exponential Moving Average ” (EMA), adopts all historical prices, and each price is exponentially weighted,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ (0,1) denotes a decaying factor.</a>
