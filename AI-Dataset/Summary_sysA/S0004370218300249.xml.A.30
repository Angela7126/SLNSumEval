<a href="#0" id="0">The process of constructing models of other agents, sometimes referred to as agent modelling or opponent modelling,{sup:2} often involves some form of learning since the model may be based on information observed from the current interaction and possibly data collected in past interactions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, an agent may model another agent's decision making as a deterministic finite automaton and learn the parameters of the automaton (e.g.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Goals are said to be common if they are identical for all agents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Many modelling methods that attempt to predict an agent's actions are unaffected by the goals of the agents, since such methods primarily work on observed actions (cf.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Based on the above intuition, type-based reasoning methods assume that the modelled agent has one of several known types.</a>
