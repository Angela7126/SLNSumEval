<a href="#0" id="0">Models of Horn formulas are distinguished by the fact that they are closed under intersection of positive atoms in an interpretation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That is:{a mathematical formula} Note that the converse is also true; i.e., if a set of models W is closed under intersection of positive atoms in an interpretation, then there is a Horn formula Φ such that {a mathematical formula}[ Φ ]=W.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In a finite language (which is what is assumed in the Katsuno and Mendelzon approach) it is straightforward to determine the relative position of two possible worlds, {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2: Simply determine the result of revising by a formula with models given by {a mathematical formula}{w1,w2}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">1 suffices to show this: Defining revision according to Definition 2 yields a revision function that satisfies (H*1) – (H*8) (see Proposition 1) and yet violates (Acyc) (simply consider the revisions by the Horn formulas {a mathematical formula} Μ 0=r, {a mathematical formula} Μ 1=q, and {a mathematical formula} Μ 2=p).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As mentioned in the beginning of the proof, the next step is to define an extension of {a mathematical formula} ⪯ ⁎ which is total, and preserves the Μ -minimal worlds, for all Horn formulas Μ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We define the basic Horn ranking associated with H, denoted ⪯ , as follows:{a mathematical formula} This ordering reflects an intuition deriving from the logic programming community, that an atom is false unless it is (depending on the underlying approach) “ required ” to be true.</a>
