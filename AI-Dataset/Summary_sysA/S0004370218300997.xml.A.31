<a href="#0" id="0">We proceed to examine the performance of the heuristic compared to the maximal social welfare that is found by the optimal algorithm.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In most of the instances that we checked the heuristic found a coalition structure with the maximal social welfare.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Specifically, we used the Slashdot, S1 and Kronecker networks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We set Α to {a mathematical formula}1,2 and fixed k to be 3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We varied the number of agents between 10 – 50.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Overall, we tested 600 different instances, and we found the following relative differences between the solution of the heuristic and the maximal social welfare:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Definition 12</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">K-C-Membership: Given: {a mathematical formula}G=(A,E, Ω ), the social network (E may contain positive and negative edges), and a coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Question: Is P a member of the k-coalitions-core?</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">where {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is a coalition structure maximizing the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">State: A coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Initial state: A coalition structure maximizing the social welfare, {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Random: In 97% of the cases a member of the strict k-coalitions-core was found within {a mathematical formula}10,000 iterations.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In 11% of the cases the initial coalition structure was not a member of the core, but if a member of the core was found it also had the maximal social welfare.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The average number of iterations was 36 steps.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Definition 17</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">K-C-Add: Given: {a mathematical formula}G=(A,E, Ω ), the social network (E may contain positive and negative edges), a coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A) (that contains exactly k coalitions), and a natural number q.</a>
