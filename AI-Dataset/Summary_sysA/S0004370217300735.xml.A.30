<a href="#0" id="0">To perform UD-test on a set {a mathematical formula}S of observed variables, we first learn two latent tree models {a mathematical formula}m1 and {a mathematical formula}m2 for {a mathematical formula}S and then compare their BIC scores.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The model {a mathematical formula}m1 is the model with the highest BIC score among all LTMs with a single latent variable, and the model {a mathematical formula}m2 is the model with the highest BIC score among all LTMs with two latent variables.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let W be the variable in {a mathematical formula}S that has the highest MI with the variable X to be added to the island.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For {a mathematical formula}m2, we choose the model where one latent variable is connected to the variables in {a mathematical formula}S âˆ– {W} and the second latent variable connected to W and X.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Both latent variables are binary and the model parameters are optimized by a fast subroutine Pem-Ltm-2l that will be described in the next section.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Among all the other variables, mission has highest MI with the three variables in the model.</a>
