<a href="#4" id="4">A factored SSP MDP-IP is an SSP MDP-IP where states {a mathematical formula}x → are specified as a joint assignment to a vector {a mathematical formula}X → of n state variables {a mathematical formula}(X1, … ,Xn) and where the dynamic credal networks (DCNs)[17], [18], [23] are used to represent the transition function.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">E.g., for {a mathematical formula}n=3, the abstract state {a mathematical formula}w → ={X1=1,X2=0} corresponds to the set of states {a mathematical formula}{{X1=1,X2=0,X3=0},{X1=1,X2=0,X3=1}}.</a>
