<a href="#1" id="1">This incompleteness in knowledge requires open-world planning — that is, planning that takes into account the fact that new entities may become known to the robot during plan execution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given the initial relational map, the planner hypothesizes extensions to it.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To create these extensions, the planner has assumptive actions it can take, each making one or more assumptions about instance knowledge.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The planner selects a sequence of assumptive actions that are likely to be true according to default knowledge, and which enable goal achievement.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The planner does not make task-irrelevant assumptions.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">1 (blue panel), five assumptions have been made in this way: (i) a meeting room exists; (ii) there is a route from a place-holder to the hypothesized meeting room; (iii) this meeting room contains objects of type magazine; (iv) a particular instance of type magazine exists; and (v) it exists in this instance of a meeting room.</a>
