<a href="#0" id="0">Considering the distributed knowledge of a group G – a key concept in the following – we define a derived relation {a mathematical formula} ∼ G= ⋂ i ∈ G ∼ i (it is easy to see that {a mathematical formula} ∼ G is an equivalence relation).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Validity is defined as usual: ⊨ Φ means that {a mathematical formula}M,m ⊨ Φ for all {a mathematical formula}M and m.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The interpretation of these languages in a pointed model is defined as usual, with the following additional clause for the resolution operator:{a mathematical formula} where the definition of {a mathematical formula}M|G is given at the beginning this section.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, this does not hold for overlapping groups G and H. In general, we have that (see the proof of the proposition above) {a mathematical formula}M,s ⊨ RGCH Φ iff {a mathematical formula}M|G,t ⊨ Φ for any {a mathematical formula}(s,t) ∈ ∼ H ⁎ ′ , where {a mathematical formula} ∼ H ⁎ ′ =( ⋂ i ∈ G ∼ i ∪ ⋃ i ∈ H ∖ G ∼ i) ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The case for distributed knowledge: similar to the case for individual knowledge, and in the proof we use {a mathematical formula} Δ (H,G → ) instead of {a mathematical formula} Δ ({i},G → ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As discussed in the introduction, it has been argued that distributed knowledge in general does not comply with the following principle of full communication[33]: if {a mathematical formula}DG Φ is true, then Φ should follow logically from the set of all formulas known by the individual agents in the group.</a>
