<a href="#0" id="0">Next, we present a semi-supervised version of our feature labeling algorithm which assumes that an unlabeled set of instances is present during training.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The semi-supervised setting for feature labeling incorporates knowledge from three sources: a small labeled training set, the feature labels provided by the end user and information from the implicit structure of the unlabeled data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We evaluate our semi-supervised algorithm using both oracle feature labels and end-user feature labels from the user study mentioned above.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our feature labeling algorithm is one of the best performing algorithms with oracle feature labels and the best performer with lower quality feature labels from end users.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">With our results, we can compare the relative gains using the different sources of knowledge available in the training set, the feature labels, and the unlabeled data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our analysis shows that incorporating unlabeled data during learning sometimes produces worse performance than just using a purely supervised learning approach, both with and without feature labeling.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, adding the information from feature labels consistently improves performance over not including this information, both in the supervised and semi-supervised settings.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our new supervised LWLR-FL algorithm expands LWLR to take feature labeling into account.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our results show that LWLR-FL was among the best performing supervised feature labeling algorithms under ideal conditions in an oracle study.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As to the end-user labels themselves, we showed that real end users ʼ feature labels helped on average for all algorithms, with the features end users chose for labeling to be conceptually related to the class labels, although with moderately lower information gains compared to those of the oracle ʼ s.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">These results are promising, as they show that end users with no background in machine learning can use feature labeling to significantly improve machine learning algorithms trained on small data sets.</a>
