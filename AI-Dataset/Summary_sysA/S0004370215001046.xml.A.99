<a href="#0" id="0">Based on the characteristics of Chinese, we proposed an omni-word feature and a soft constraint method for Chinese relation extraction in our previous study [9], but many details of the omni-word feature and soft constraint were not fully explored.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Next, four issues related to the feature assembly method are discussed: omni-word feature, constraint conditions, feature assembly and negative instances, which are key issues when training a relation extractor based on the feature assembly method.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The conventional dictionary can ensure that many common words are included, while the domain dictionary can reduce the impact of unknown words when applying our method in a specific domain.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In Table 5, the weak performance of the collection constraint is because relation arguments (entity) are order sensitive, so the collective features cannot capture local dependency information in this situation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In addition to the proposed features, the good performance in Row 1 is also because the features for the positive instances were extracted from annotated relation mentions, whereas the features for the negative instances were extracted from sentences divided by five types of punctuation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Both of these studies used dependency trees and parse trees to capture the local dependency of relation instances, but they used another strategy to control the asymmetric relation problem, i.e., a new inverted relation type was introduced for each asymmetric relation type.</a>
