<a href="#0" id="0">We start by defining pair-dependency as:{a mathematical formula} which is the positive contribution that all shortest paths between s and t make to the assessment of node v. The value of the function {a mathematical formula}f Δ depends solely on the distance between s and t. For instance, if we set {a mathematical formula}f Δ =1d(s,t) we obtain the distance-scaled betweenness centrality measure introduced by Borgatti and Everett [14].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Next, we define one-side dependency as:{a mathematical formula} which is the positive contribution that all shortest paths starting with node s make to the assessment of node v. Now, building upon the recursive equation proposed by Brandes [15], we obtain the following:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In weighted graphs, the pair-dependency limited to the shortest paths consisting of i nodes is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} This limited pair-dependency measures the influence of all shortest paths between s and t consisting of i nodes on the evaluation of node v. Note that the value of the function {a mathematical formula}f Δ ⁎ depends solely on the number of nodes lying on the shortest paths between s and t.</a>
