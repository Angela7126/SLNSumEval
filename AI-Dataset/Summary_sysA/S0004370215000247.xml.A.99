<a href="#0" id="0">In the first type of search space, the initial task network is reduced to a primitive task network that constitutes a solution to the planning problem.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">At each point in the space, the task network can be seen as a partially specified plan until the search reaches the point where the task network is primitive and represents a solution plan.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, we employ the term plan space to refer to this type of search space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We refer to HTN planners that search in this plan space as plan-based HTN planners, and to the model of HTN planning as plan-based HTN planning.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For the obvious reasons, we employ the term state space to refer to the second type of search space.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We refer to HTN planners searching in this space as state-based HTN planners, and to the model of HTN planning as state-based HTN planning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">HTN planning assumes an initial task network {a mathematical formula}tn0 to be accomplished as an objective for {a mathematical formula}P. In its simplest form, {a mathematical formula}tn0 does not allow to specify conditions to be satisfied in some intermediate state during or in the final state of the execution of the solution to {a mathematical formula}P. Extended goals enable to express a planning objective in a way that its satisfaction could be on a part, on the whole trajectory of the solution, or in the final state.</a>
