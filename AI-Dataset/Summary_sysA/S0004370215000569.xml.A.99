<a href="#0" id="0">A qualitative constraint network Γ is called minimal if for each constraint {a mathematical formula}(xRy) in Γ , R is the minimal (i.e., the strongest) relation between x, y that is entailed by Γ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Suppose{a mathematical formula} Γ ={viTijvj:1 ≤ i,j ≤ n}is a qualitative constraint network over{a mathematical formula}M. If Γ is weakly globally consistent, then it is minimal.For every pair of variables {a mathematical formula}vi,vj ({a mathematical formula}i ≠ j) and every basic relation Α in {a mathematical formula}Tij, it is clear that {a mathematical formula}{vi Α vj} is a consistent scenario of {a mathematical formula} Γ ↓ {vi,vj}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The following two lemmas show that a constraint {a mathematical formula}(xRy) in Γ is redundant iff R contains the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in {a mathematical formula} Γ ∖ {(xRy)}.</a>
