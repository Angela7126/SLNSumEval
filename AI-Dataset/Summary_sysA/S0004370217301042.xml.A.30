<a href="#0" id="0">Although the agent {a mathematical formula} Α i cannot plan using {a mathematical formula} Π i ▷ , as the resulting plan might not be executable in the multi-agent problem {a mathematical formula}M, it can be used for heuristic computation (the projected problem is in fact an abstraction of {a mathematical formula}M).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to find a plan, the MADLA Planner searches through a state-space (where states are {a mathematical formula}s ⊆ P) induced by the input multi-agent planning problem, driven by a pair of a projected (local) heuristic and a distributed (global) heuristic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The main principle of multi-agent heuristic search is that all agents explore their portions of the search space asynchronously and in parallel, each agent using only its actions from {a mathematical formula}Ai.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The MADLA Search uses two heuristics for each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i, a local projected {a mathematical formula}hLi and a distributed {a mathematical formula}hDi.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The search uses an open list for each of the heuristics {a mathematical formula}OLi,ODi for each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The open list selection function prioritizes expansion of states in the open list {a mathematical formula}ODi respective to the distributed heuristic {a mathematical formula}hDi, if the heuristic estimator of {a mathematical formula}hDi is not in the process of computing an heuristic estimate (i.e.</a>
