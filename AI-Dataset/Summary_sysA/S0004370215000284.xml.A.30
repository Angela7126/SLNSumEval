<a href="#0" id="0">However, if no guidance is provided to the teacher, he may demonstrate an action that is already known by the system.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the model, the actions are represented as a set of action rules, which can be applied over a state space.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, we propose the use of a rule analysis approach to provide some guidance to the teacher so he can demonstrate the unknown parts needed by the decision maker.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In summary, we propose a RL algorithm that can request demonstrations from a teacher whenever it requires new unknown actions to complete a task, which significantly reduces the number of experiences required to learn.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The REX-D algorithm requests demonstrations from the teacher whenever it does not know how to complete the task.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, several actions may be required to complete the task, only one of which might be unknown to the system.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, if no guidance is provided, the teacher may demonstrate actions that the system already knows before demonstrating the action that is actually required.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our objective is to avoid these unnecessary demonstrations, thereby minimizing the number of interactions with the teacher.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the proposed REX-D algorithm, we added demonstration requests to the relational RL algorithm REX.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In addition to the faster learning, demonstrations allow the algorithm to learn actions as they are required by extending generalization to different tasks, and new actions can be added if necessary.</a>
