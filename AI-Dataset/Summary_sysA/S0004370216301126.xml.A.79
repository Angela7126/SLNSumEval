<a href="#0" id="0">For convergence to an efficient allocation by means of IR deals, {a mathematical formula}nm − 1, with n being the number of agents and m being the number of goods, is known to be a (tight) upper bound on the longest path, i.e., there exist profiles of valuation functions and initial allocations such that it is possible to visit all allocations before convergence [29].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Take a scenario where the agents have the valuation functions used in the proof of Lemma 6, except that {a mathematical formula}vn(G) is set to such a high value that the only way of achieving a proportional state is to give all goods to agent n (because no payments the other agents would be prepared to make could be large enough to give utility {a mathematical formula}vn(G)/n to agent n).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, observe that under the payment scheme of Theorem 8, which is characterised by Inequality (2), the envy-freeness condition {a mathematical formula}ui(A(i), Π (i)) ⩾ ui(A(j), Π (j)) is equivalent to the following inequality (which must hold for any two agents i and j):{a mathematical formula} To prove the claim of the theorem, we give an example with two agents and two goods, where Inequality (3) fails to be satisfied for the unique efficient allocation.</a>
