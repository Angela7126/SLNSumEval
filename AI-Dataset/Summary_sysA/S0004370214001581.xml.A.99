<a href="#0" id="0">Focusing on the structure of {a mathematical formula}CG Π B, let {a mathematical formula}RB-PlanExist(G) and {a mathematical formula}RB-PlanGen(G) be respectively the plan existence and plan generation problems restricted to {a mathematical formula}RB planning tasks whose black causal graphs are elements of{a mathematical formula}G. Note that these problems put no restriction on the structure of the causal graph itself beyond being a super-graph of some element of {a mathematical formula}G. Theorem 5 below refines the complexity characterization for {a mathematical formula}RB with respect to the structure of the black causal graph, providing a valuable fragment of tractability via Theorem 1, and establishing {a mathematical formula}P/NPdichotomies for both general {a mathematical formula}RB, as well as for {a mathematical formula}RB restricted to fixed-size domain variables.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In red facts following, the sub-tasks {a mathematical formula} Π B are red – black planning tasks, with the weaker properties discussed above: the black causal graph is acyclic, there aren't any goals on the red variables, and for each black DTG we know that (a) from our initial position we can reach all values, and (b) once we traversed any arc {a mathematical formula}(d,d ′ ) we will have the red outside conditions required for at least one inverse arc {a mathematical formula}(d ′ ,d).</a>
