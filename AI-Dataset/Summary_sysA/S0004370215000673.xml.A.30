<a href="#1" id="1">We begin by proving a property that links the rank {a mathematical formula}kM of a formula in any rational model {a mathematical formula}M of a given knowledge base K and the rank of that formula as calculated in the definition of rational closure (Definition 5).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let K be a knowledge base and{a mathematical formula}Mbe a canonical model of K minimal with respect to{a mathematical formula}<FIMS.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We show that, for all conditionals{a mathematical formula}A| ∼ B ∈ L:{a mathematical formula}where{a mathematical formula}K¯is the rational closure of K.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Rational closure of TBoxLet {a mathematical formula}K=(TBox,ABox) be a DL knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Next we define the notion of minimal canonical model.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Minimal canonical models (with respect to TBox){a mathematical formula}M is a minimal canonical model of K if it satisfies K, it is minimal (with respect to Definition 23) and it is canonical (according to Definition 24).</a>
