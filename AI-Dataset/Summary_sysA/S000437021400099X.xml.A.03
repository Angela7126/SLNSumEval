<a href="#0" id="0">The k-ary unbiased black-box complexity of some class of functions {a mathematical formula}F is the complexity of {a mathematical formula}F with respect to all k-ary unbiased black-box algorithms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then the black-box complexity of P is at most {a mathematical formula}O(s).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As has already been pointed out in [10], the unrestricted black-box complexity of MaxClique is at most {a mathematical formula}(n2)+1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">That is, we give a unary unbiased black-box algorithm which solves any instance of {a mathematical formula}Partition ≠ in {a mathematical formula}O(nlog ⁡ n) queries.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This implies, in particular, that the unrestricted black-box complexity of Partition is linear in {a mathematical formula}|I|.</a>
