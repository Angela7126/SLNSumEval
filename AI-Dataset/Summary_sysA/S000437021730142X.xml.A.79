<a href="#0" id="0">An inherent computational problem of conceptual blending is to find a common ground, called generic space, between the two input concepts [27].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These are (i) the input spaces that are to be blended, (ii) a partial cross-space mapping that connects counterparts in the input mental spaces, (iii) a generic space that is an abstraction from what the input spaces have in common, (iv) a blending operation that produces a blend of the input spaces and into which the structure of the input spaces is selectively projected, and (v) an emergent structure, i.e., structure that is a synergistic gain to the naive sum of the structure of input spaces.</a>
