<a href="#0" id="0">Formally, given a simple KB {a mathematical formula}K= 〈 O,A 〉 , the generating structure{a mathematical formula}gen(K)= 〈 Δ gen(K), ⋅ gen(K) 〉 of {a mathematical formula}K, is defined as:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}a ∈ ind(A), A is a concept name, and P is a role name occurring in {a mathematical formula}K. It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}gen(K) is of polynomial size in the size of {a mathematical formula}K. Note that the canonical model {a mathematical formula}uni(K) can be obtained by unraveling [56, Ch.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From the previous examples, we conclude that: There exists a mapping{a mathematical formula}M=( Σ , Γ ,B)and a KB{a mathematical formula}Ks= 〈 S,As 〉 over Σ such that there is no universal solution for{a mathematical formula}Ksunder{a mathematical formula}M(even if extended ABoxes are allowed).</a>
