<a href="#0" id="0">In our approach, we go a step further because our model is able to predict faulty behavior too.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus we can provide a more precise set of candidates if we take into account how faults are related to parameters [11], [32]: FaultA fault is a deviation of exactly one parameter of the system model from its nominal value.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we focus on the problem where the diagnosis model {a mathematical formula}S is diagnosable and the user provides the initial distribution of the measurement and fault sets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 7 shows the design results using PC-based residuals.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As shown in Table 6, Table 7, using PC-based residuals the design results are improved in two different ways: (1) the size of the local diagnosers for diagnosis submodels {a mathematical formula}S1 to {a mathematical formula}S4 after the design process is smaller than the size of the diagnosers using {a mathematical formula}M-based residuals (using PC-based residuals, only one additional residual, instead of two, is needed); and (2), PC-based residuals allow to have a fully distributed approach, not only regarding local diagnosers, but also regarding the residual generators (with {a mathematical formula}M-based residuals the diagnosis process will be distributed, but the residual computation will still be centralized).</a>
