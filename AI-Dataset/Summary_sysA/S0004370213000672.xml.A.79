<a href="#1" id="1">We show by induction that then {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β ),set( Γ )) ⊆ set( Α ).If {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Β ⋈ Σ Γ → Α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯1), then it is not hard to see from (40) that {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β ),set( Γ )) ⊆ set( Α ).If {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Β ⋈ Σ Γ → Α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯2), then there exist {a mathematical formula} Α ′ , {a mathematical formula} Β ′ , {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ such that {a mathematical formula} Α ′ ⊨ A Α , {a mathematical formula} Β ⊨ A Β ′ , {a mathematical formula} Γ ⊨ A Γ ′ , {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊆ Σ ′ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Β ′ ⋈ Σ ′ Γ ′ → Α ′ .</a>
