<a href="#0" id="0">we present a combined task – motion planning algorithm that implements geometric backtracking;</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In these approaches, a task plan is generated, and some of the actions involve motion planning problems which are solved by dedicated motion planners or other geometric reasoners.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each motion planning problem is solved immediately, when the action is applied by the task planner.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If the motion planner fails, it can add constraints to the task planning problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our combined task and motion planner utilizes a hybrid state representation, where certain predicates are evaluated as usual in the symbolic state component, but other predicates are evaluated in the geometric component.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}C is expressed with four parameters for each motion planning problem.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Algorithm 4 (searchGeomSeq) visits alternative geometric instantiations of the selected actions in {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The planner queries the world model in order to get geometric information about the planning problem addressed.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The fourth heuristic is {a mathematical formula}fselCOLL ▹ fselREVCHRONO, which realizes our geometric backtracking approach.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The last heuristic is {a mathematical formula}fselREVCHRONO, which results in performing a complete search with full geometric backtracking (see Section 4) since every previous action is possibly selected.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The planner performing full geometric backtracking is guided towards solution plans that contain most often four actions (68% of the solution plans for {a mathematical formula}fselREVCHRONO).</a>
