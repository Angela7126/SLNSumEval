<a href="#0" id="0">The agent uses the feature function f to identify the relevant features, and then uses both state attributes and features to predict the action effects.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The remaining task is to learn {a mathematical formula}P(e|s,a)=P(e|x(s),a), where {a mathematical formula}x(s)=(s,f(s)) is a vector containing both the state attributes and the state features.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This prediction is based on the features of the state and the parameters {a mathematical formula} Θ ( Τ ) of the view that may be adjusted based on the actual effects observed in the task environment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our main task is to turn transition model learning into the learning of conditional distributions {a mathematical formula}P(E|s,f(s),a) using multinomial logistic regression for which attention to relevant features can be efficiently implemented online via mDAGL.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">At each time step, a random action a is chosen with a small probability Ε , but otherwise we calculate the optimal policy Π for an MDP with the transition model {a mathematical formula}T(W) is based on the current effect predictors.</a>
