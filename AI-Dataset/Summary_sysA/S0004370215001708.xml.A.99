<a href="#0" id="0">When such an answer A exists for every query Q from a given class of queries, one talks about strong representation systems for that class, under the semantics {a mathematical formula} 〚 〛 , see [19], [2].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Unfortunately, strong representation systems may not exist even for simple queries over standard semantics of incompleteness, e.g., even quantifier-free queries for the closed-world semantics [2].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that this definition requires that both the input database D, and the answer A, be interpreted under the same semantics {a mathematical formula} 〚 〛 .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We look at certain information contained in sets {a mathematical formula} 〚 x 〛 and prove that, as expected, it is represented at the object level by x itself, and at the knowledge level by {a mathematical formula} Δ x, defining the semantics of x.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Indeed, if we had formulae Δ , we would have had {a mathematical formula} Δ c ′ ∈ Th(Q( 〚 x 〛 )) − Th(Q(x)), which is made impossible by (4) in the presence of a representation system.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, it is essential to go via certain answers as knowledge to get the object representation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Again this query is monotone and generic, and it is easy to see that with the class of ground atoms and their conjunctions, {a mathematical formula}DowaC( Σ ) forms a representation system.</a>
