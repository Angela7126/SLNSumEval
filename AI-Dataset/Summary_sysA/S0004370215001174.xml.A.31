<a href="#0" id="0">Another important aspect of a competition is its evolution.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Many existing competitions are held periodically (e.g., annually), changing tests over time to address more difficult problems, to enlarge the variety of problems, to provide different experimental conditions, etc.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When a competition is run for many years, it is important to evaluate how its design and organization affect the solutions implemented by the participating research groups.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this article, we are mainly interested in analyzing the results of competitions over the years.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, we focus on how this analysis has been carried out in the last years within the RoboCup@Home competition, which is the largest competition for domestic and service robots.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The evaluation of a competition's effectiveness based on the scores of the teams over the years is important for better fueling the competition and the novel approach introduced in RoboCup@Home for addressing this issue is the main contribution of this article.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Although our analysis reported in this article is specific to the RoboCup@Home competition, we believe that its principles can be applied both to other existing competitions and to new ones, and it could even be used for evaluating multi-year projects or challenges in AI and robotics where some tasks are repeated and changed over the years.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Moreover, the RoCKIn project and the competition organized within it clearly relate competitions and benchmarking.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Teams are required to provide data about the internal states of their robot during the test through a predefined common logging system.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Ground truth information are collected during the test with devices and software provided by the organizers.</a>
