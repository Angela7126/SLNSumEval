<a href="#0" id="0">Relevant in the current context is the fact that the distribution is defined as a function of count features, which, adapting the notation of the previous example, can be written in the form{a mathematical formula} where now {a mathematical formula} Φ (X) can be any first-order formula with free variables X.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While, thus, very similar in appearance to the aggregate features of the preceding example, there are some essential differences: first, MLNs depend on the actual integer-valued count feature, not only on derived Boolean features of the form {a mathematical formula}count{ … } ⩾ k.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If all the groundings of the original branch are labeled with copies of the original weight assignment, then the discriminant function defined by the grounded TET is the same as the discriminant function defined by the original TET.</a>
