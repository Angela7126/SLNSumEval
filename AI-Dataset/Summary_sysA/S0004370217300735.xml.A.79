<a href="#0" id="0">In the LDA-based methods, observed variables are token variables (usually denoted as {a mathematical formula}Wd,n), and latent variables are constructs in a hypothetical document generation process, including a list of topics (usually denoted as Β ), a topic distribution vector for each document (usually denoted as {a mathematical formula} Θ d), and a topic assignment for each token in each document (usually denoted as {a mathematical formula}Zd,n).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We refer to the latent variables in the flat model from the first step as level 1 latent variables.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The objective of the second step (line 9) is to turn the level 1 latent variables into observed variables through data completion.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Such topics can be obtained as follows: First, pick a list of words to characterize a topic using the method described in Section 4; then, form a latent class model using those words as observed variables; and finally, use the model to partition all documents into two clusters.</a>
