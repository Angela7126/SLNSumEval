<a href="#0" id="0">We use AI planning as a general framework to tackle the temporal voltage control problem in an active distribution network.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The AC voltage control problem is concerned with maintaining the voltage at each busbar of a distribution network (or a zone of the network) within a given bound, for an extended period of time, assuming that the load profile of consumers and the schedule of the power system generators are known over this period.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We now have the elements of a BTMP (Definition 5), because the voltage is a function of both the controllable and uncontrollable metric fluents, and hence is a mixed metric expression.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">All of the metric fluents in the problem are controllable or uncontrollable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have an always trajectory constraint as specified in Definition 5.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore the AC voltage control problem is a BTMP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this paper we have defined a new class of problems, Bounded Trajectory Management Problems (BTMPs), and introduced AC voltage control as an instance of this class.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We have addressed the problem of AC voltage control by extending the planner popf2, to popf-tif, along two dimensions: Timed Initial Fluents on one dimension and integration with a specialised power flow equation solver on the other.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The computation of the voltage at each node of the network, for specified loads and generation configurations, is called the power flow (or load flow) problem.</a>
