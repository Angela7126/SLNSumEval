<a href="#0" id="0">In order to get more insight into the effect of ADW's disambiguation step on the final performance when measuring the similarity of word pairs, we carried out a series of experiments where no disambiguation was performed on the two linguistic items.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the absence of the disambiguation step, a semantic signature for a linguistic item is generated by initializing the PPR algorithm from all the nodes (i.e., synsets) associated with that linguistic item, rather than the specific disambiguated synsets obtained as a result of the alignment-based disambiguation (see Section 5.1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In other words, the personalization vector {a mathematical formula}S0 in Equation (2) is constructed by uniformly distributing the probability mass among all the corresponding dimensions of all senses of all the content words in the item.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that in this case the semantic signature of a linguistic item is generated independently of its paired linguistic item.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As we mentioned in Section 5.3 the disambiguation step is particularly suitable for short textual items, such as words or phrases, as an implicit disambiguation takes place when modeling longer textual items such as sentences.</a>
