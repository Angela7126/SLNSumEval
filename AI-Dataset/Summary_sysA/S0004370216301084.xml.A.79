<a href="#0" id="0">Then the cost of a path s with respect to X is defined as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} ℓ e(X) is the amount of flow passing through edge e, defined as{a mathematical formula} A useful property of the choice vector X is that as each player i chooses path s with probability {a mathematical formula} Π i,s=xi,sn, the expected value of each {a mathematical formula}Xi,s is exactly {a mathematical formula}xi,s, which implies that {a mathematical formula}E[Xi]=xi for each i and {a mathematical formula}E[X]=x.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then we can conclude that their distributions at step t are all the same,{sup:12} which basically can be described by the flow {a mathematical formula}xit of player i, due to the law of large number as the number of agents is huge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our main result in this section is the following, which shows that if each player (or agent of a player) uses such an update algorithm, the system quickly converges, in the sense that the value of the potential function {a mathematical formula} Φ (xt) quickly approaches the minimum {a mathematical formula} Φ (q), where {a mathematical formula}q=arg ⁡ minz ∈ K ⁡ Φ (z).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The proof of the theorem is based on the idea of Section 3.1 that if each player i can actually have her portion {a mathematical formula} ∇ i Φ (x Τ ) of the gradient vector {a mathematical formula} ∇ Φ (x Τ ) and do the update{a mathematical formula} then the collective update of all players can be seen as doing some generalized mirror descent on the convex function Φ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this case, each player's algorithm becomes the multiplicative updates algorithm, and according to Proposition 15 we can choose{a mathematical formula} which gives us{a mathematical formula} Although we stated above the convergence bounds in terms of the number of episodes, by incorporating the sizes of the episodes, it follows that the number of steps needed for convergence is at most{a mathematical formula}</a>
