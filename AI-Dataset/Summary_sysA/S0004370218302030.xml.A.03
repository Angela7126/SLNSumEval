<a href="#0" id="0">Constraints (3) and (5) ensure that at any decision epoch t, the number of servers assigned from a zone is less than the number of available servers in the zone at decision epoch t. Constraint (4) ensures that for each element in {a mathematical formula}Dt, the number of requests assigned to servers is less than the number of available requests between origin and destination zone pairs corresponding to element j of {a mathematical formula}Dt.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Requests having origin in {a mathematical formula}Zi at decision epoch 1, can only be assigned server from the zone {a mathematical formula}Zi.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The server will be available in zone {a mathematical formula}Z0 only if the request at decision epoch {a mathematical formula}4k − 2 is served.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The variable {a mathematical formula}xi is set to true if at first decision epoch zone {a mathematical formula}Zi server is assigned to the request having destination in zone {a mathematical formula}Zi otherwise it is set to false.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">So at decision epoch 1, if {a mathematical formula}xi is true, we assign {a mathematical formula}Zi server to request having destination in zone {a mathematical formula}Zi otherwise it is assigned to the request having destination in zone {a mathematical formula}Zi ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">After serving the request at decision epoch 3, the server will become available in the zone {a mathematical formula}Z1 again.</a>
