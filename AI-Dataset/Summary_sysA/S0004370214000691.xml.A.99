<a href="#0" id="0">The analysis of the case where bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information is an instance of the case where the auctioneer needs to calculate her expected-benefit-maximizing strategy given the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, as given in Section 3.2, for {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this case, the auctioneer will simply choose the subset {a mathematical formula}Rauc associated with the maximum value according to the first column in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since all elements in the first column, except for {a mathematical formula}( ∅ , ∅ ), decrease equally due to the increase in the value C, the auctioneer will keep on using this strategy for any setting with greater C values until her expected benefit is less than {a mathematical formula}u( ∅ , ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As for the dependency of the auctioneer's expected benefit in C for the case in which the bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option of purchasing the information, here the only possible switch is from {a mathematical formula}Rauc ≠ ∅ to {a mathematical formula}Rauc= ∅ (though this derives only from the auctioneer's optimization considerations rather than stability considerations).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is because once the auctioneer determines the strategy {a mathematical formula}Rauc that yields her the maximum expected benefit, the expected benefit from this strategy and from any other strategy {a mathematical formula}R ≠ ∅ decreases equally due to an increase in the value of C. Therefore, the only way that the choice of a preferred subset-to-be-disclosed can change is when {a mathematical formula}Rauc= ∅ becomes associated with the highest value in its column in Table 1.</a>
