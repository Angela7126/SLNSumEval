<a href="#0" id="0">A representative-voter rule is an aggregation rule F that is such that for every profile E there exists an individual {a mathematical formula}i ⋆ ∈ N such that {a mathematical formula}F(E)=Ei ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An aggregation rule F is called collectively rational with respect to a graph property P if {a mathematical formula}F(E) satisfies P whenever all of the individual graphs in {a mathematical formula}E=(E1, … ,En) do.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now consider the collective graph {a mathematical formula}F(E).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We now know that any Arrovian aggregation rule F that is collectively rational with respect to some contagious graph property P can be fully described in terms of a single family {a mathematical formula}W of winning coalitions, at least as far as F's behaviour on nonreflexive edges is concerned.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">An aggregation rule F is frame collectively rational with respect to a modal integrity constraint Φ if {a mathematical formula} 〈 V,Ei 〉 ⊨ Φ for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N implies {a mathematical formula} 〈 V,F(E) 〉 ⊨ Φ .</a>
