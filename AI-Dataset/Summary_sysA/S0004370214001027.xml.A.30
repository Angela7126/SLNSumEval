<a href="#0" id="0">This section develops several new approaches for computing one MES of a CNF formula {a mathematical formula}F. The first solution consists of adapting any MUS extraction algorithm based on identification of so-called transition clauses, for MES extraction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Afterwards, key techniques used in MUS extraction are studied.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Model rotation [23], [24] is applied to MES extraction, and it is argued that clause set refinement [21], [22], [23] cannot be directly applied to MES extraction algorithms resulting from adapting existing MUS extraction algorithms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Next, a reduction from MES to group-MUS formulation [25], [22] is developed, which enables the use of both model rotation and clause set refinement.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Although the reduction of MES to group-MUS extraction enables the integration of key techniques, it is also the case that the resulting instances of SAT are hard to solve.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This section concludes by developing an incremental reduction from MES to group-MUS extraction, which produces much easier instances of SAT.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows: (i) Adapting existing MUS extraction algorithms for MES extraction; (ii) Development of model rotation for MES extraction, and analysis of why clause set refinement cannot be applied; (iii) Reduction of MES to group-MUS extraction, which enables both model rotation and clause set refinement to be applied; (iv) Use of chunks for incremental reduction of MES to group-MUS extraction, aiming at reducing the hardness of instances of SAT when the formula includes the negation of a CNF formula; (v) Extension of the techniques to the group-MES computation problem; (vi) Development of a very effective technique for pruning redundant clauses using backbone computation; and (vii) Development of a solution for the independent certification of the correctness of computed MESes.</a>
