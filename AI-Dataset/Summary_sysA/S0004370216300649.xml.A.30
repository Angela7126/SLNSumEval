<a href="#0" id="0">In the classical random k-SAT model, a random formula {a mathematical formula}Fk(n,m) is a set of m clauses over n variables, where clauses are chosen uniformly and independently among all {a mathematical formula}2k(nk) non-trivial clauses of length k. A non-trivial clause of length k contains k distinct, non-complementary literals.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to analyze the community structure of the SAT instances obtained with our model, we have generated some sets of random formulas for different values of {a mathematical formula}Q ∈ {0.9,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.3} (hence {a mathematical formula}p=Q+1/c), and for different values of number of communities {a mathematical formula}c ∈ {10,20,40,80}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each set contains 50 random instances.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Remark that the modularity Q of (real) industrial SAT instances is usually greater than 0.7 [9], while no modularity greater than 0.3 is found for classical random k-CNF formulas.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, the number of communities c is usually in the interval {a mathematical formula}[10,100][9].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In a second experiment, we generate families of instances with the same number of variables n and the same clause/variable ratios {a mathematical formula}m/n than in the previous experiment, and varying the number of communities c with a fixed modularity {a mathematical formula}Q=0.8.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Also, we use a random SAT instance of the family from our model with {a mathematical formula}n=1000 variables, {a mathematical formula}m=4200 clauses, clause length {a mathematical formula}k=3, modularity {a mathematical formula}Q=0.8 and {a mathematical formula}c=10 communities.</a>
