<a href="#0" id="0">Intrinsic hierarchical tag structures are not considered in model design; (2) Tag statistical correlations and the interactions between visual and tag data are not fully exploited, partly due to model complexity and design limitation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our model goes beyond the classification forest in the following aspects: (1) Employing tags to constrain tree structure learning, rather than learning a generalised prediction function as [49], [45]; (2) Introducing a new objective function allowing acceptance of multi-tags, exploitation of abstract-to-specific tag hierarchy and accommodation of multiple tag correlations simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Instead of learning a classifier, HML-RF is designed to infer visual semantic concept structure for more accurately revealing both global visual data group structures and local tag structures of individual visual data samples.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These structural relationships among data samples imply their underlying data group/cluster relations (obtained using a standard graph based clustering algorithm on the similarity graph estimated by our HML-RF model), as well as the specific tag concept structures of individual samples (predicted using the discovered semantic neighbourhoods encoded in the tree structures of HML-RF).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">AASC yields much poorer clustering results than HML-RF, suggesting that the construction of individual affinity matrices can lose significant information, such as the interactions between the visual and tag data, as well as statistical tag correlations.</a>
