<a href="#0" id="0">While the results apply in general, they are strongest when {a mathematical formula}m ∈ poly(n) (e.g., for matching or when all coalitions that can form have constant size), since in this case we obtain a clear dichotomy of polynomial in n vs. exponential in n. Moreover, if {a mathematical formula}m ∈ poly(n), then many involved problems in constructing improvement steps (finding a local blocking coalition, or the one with maximum benefit) can be solved trivially in time {a mathematical formula}poly(n).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given an instance of socially stable matching consisting of a graph {a mathematical formula}GM=(VM,EM) of potential matching edges, social link set {a mathematical formula}L ⊆ EM, and edge benefits b, we construct an equivalent coalition formation game with consistent constraints as follows.</a>
