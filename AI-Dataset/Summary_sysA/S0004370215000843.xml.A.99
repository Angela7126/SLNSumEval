<a href="#0" id="0">The content of a robot KR system has to be continuously updated with new perceptual or actuation data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As this information is already present in the robot's control system, we consider the KR system as a kind of ‘ parasite ’ on top of the existing data structures whose task is to make sense from them and to lift them to a conceptual level.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a consequence, the content of the knowledge base is grounded in these data structures that have carefully been developed by a robot programmer in such a way that they are grounded in the outer world, for instance using specialized perception routines.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our knowledge base only has a rather shallow symbolic representation of general concepts, while most information about the robot, its environment and perceptions is merely a “ virtual knowledge base ” computed at runtime from the data structures of the robot's control program.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">for visualization or grasp planning, robots often need to interact with specific object parts that have functional meaning for the action at hand: For picking up items, they should use the handle; for pouring something from or into a container, they need information about its opening direction and volume; for pouring something onto a surface, they have to select a suitable horizontal surface.</a>
