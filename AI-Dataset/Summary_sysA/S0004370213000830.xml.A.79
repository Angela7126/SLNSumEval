<a href="#0" id="0">However, their work did not evaluate feature labeling in a statistical user study involving a large number of actual end users.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to evaluate our feature labeling algorithm, we perform an empirical comparison on multiple data sets under ideal conditions, using feature labels obtained from an oracle, and under real-world conditions for one particular dataset, using feature labels harvested from actual end users.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore the oracle study provides an optimistic estimate on the potential gains of using these feature labeling algorithms by providing enough ideal feature labels to benefit the algorithm and by carefully tuning the parameters of the feature labeling algorithms over a large validation set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We then used the end users ʼ data to compare the performance of the same algorithms as in our oracle study, but with smaller validation sets of size 24 (six instances for each class) to simulate a realistic scenario in which end users were able to label only a limited amount of training instances for both a training and a validation set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The performance of the algorithm on 20 Newsgroups hardly improved beyond {a mathematical formula}k=0.5 which might suggest that instances in this dataset formed very few compact clusters in the feature space and the seed (labeled training) instances managed to cover most of them.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A naïve implementation of matrix inversion does not scale well to large datasets since the complexity is {a mathematical formula}O(n3) for n instances (where n is the number of training and test instances) and is a roadblock to allowing LWLR-SS-FL to be applied to large datasets in an interactive setting, which is an important requirement of feature labeling [32].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These results are promising, as they show that end users with no background in machine learning can use feature labeling to significantly improve machine learning algorithms trained on small data sets.</a>
