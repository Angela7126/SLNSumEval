<a href="#1" id="1">In the Gradient-based method, some modules or cells of a lattice grid become a ‘ source ’ module and play the role of a ‘ seed ’ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In that work, the paths planned by {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ between vacant lattice positions in the goal configuration and modules located off those positions are automatically rewritten into a rule set Φ in such a way that the modular robot reconfigures into a goal configuration by decentralized execution of the rules.Finite State Machines (FSM):In this method each module is equipped with an internal logic that determines its docking behavior according to the sequence of states.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Yu and Nagpal [200] proposed a stepwise algorithm for producing a ‘ pressure-adaptive column ’ system from modular robots in three steps: (i) modules detect the presence of unknown objects on the structure, (ii) each module transmits the value of its pressure sensor to its neighbors, and (iii) each module controls its actuator parameters based on sensor feedbacks received from neighbors.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A ‘ modular gripper ’ that can manipulate fragile objects was studied in [200], in which through employing distributed sensing and actuation, chain modules actuate in order to grasp an object in a fixed morphology (see Fig.</a>
