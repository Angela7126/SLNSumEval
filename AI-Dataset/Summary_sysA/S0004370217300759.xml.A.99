<a href="#0" id="0">Considering the distributed knowledge of a group G – a key concept in the following – we define a derived relation {a mathematical formula} ∼ G= ⋂ i ∈ G ∼ i (it is easy to see that {a mathematical formula} ∼ G is an equivalence relation).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Validity is defined as usual: ⊨ Φ means that {a mathematical formula}M,m ⊨ Φ for all {a mathematical formula}M and m.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The interpretation of these languages in a pointed model is defined as usual, with the following additional clause for the resolution operator:{a mathematical formula} where the definition of {a mathematical formula}M|G is given at the beginning this section.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, this does not hold for overlapping groups G and H. In general, we have that (see the proof of the proposition above) {a mathematical formula}M,s ⊨ RGCH Φ iff {a mathematical formula}M|G,t ⊨ Φ for any {a mathematical formula}(s,t) ∈ ∼ H ⁎ ′ , where {a mathematical formula} ∼ H ⁎ ′ =( ⋂ i ∈ G ∼ i ∪ ⋃ i ∈ H ∖ G ∼ i) ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then,{a mathematical formula}where Θ is the union of all{a mathematical formula}Gxsuch that{a mathematical formula}i ∈ Gx, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} Θ = ⋃ {Gx|i ∈ Gx}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As we see from the previous section, the reduction axioms for individual knowledge and distributed knowledge both contain two distinct cases, and the principles of iterated resolution become more complicated.</a>
