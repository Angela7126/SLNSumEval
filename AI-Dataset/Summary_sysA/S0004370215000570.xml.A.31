<a href="#0" id="0">In multi-object manipulation, the robot has to decide at each time instance which object to manipulate.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We consider problems, where the world consists of N objects with varying attributes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The total number of actions is {a mathematical formula} âˆ‘ i|Ai|, where {a mathematical formula}|Ai| denotes the number of possible actions for object i.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In each time step, the action of the robot changes the spatial locations and poses of the objects, and the robot makes an observation about the changed state of the world.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our POMDP model uses discrete actions and observations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, instead of forcing the robotic planning problem into a manageable discrete state space as is done e.g.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">in [40], we use a POMDP method based on particle filtering (discussed in Section 3.2) that allows us to maintain complex object information required for efficient multi-object manipulation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In multi-object manipulation, robot actions may have far reaching consequences: lifting first cup A and then cup B, may increase the probability of cup C being observed dirty from low to high by exposing it more fully.</a>
