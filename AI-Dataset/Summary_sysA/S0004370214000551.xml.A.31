<a href="#0" id="0">There are ad hoc solutions to these limitations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This paper discussed two search problems: bounded-cost search, and anytime search.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In a bounded-cost search, once a solution of cost lower than a given cost is found, the search can halt.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In an anytime search, the search continues, returning better and better solutions until the search is either halted by the user, or until an optimal solution has been found.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Both types of problems have important applications and this paper presents PTS and {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ to solve them.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The relation between bounded-cost and anytime search problems emphasizes the need for an efficient bounded-cost search algorithm.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this paper we propose such an algorithm, called PTS.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">PTS is a best – first search that expands nodes in order of their potential, which is the probability that a node will lead to a solution under the cost bound.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The relation between a given heuristic and the optimal cost is used to develop a cost function that can order the nodes in OPEN approximately according to their potential, without actually calculating it.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Both PTS and its corresponding anytime algorithm {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ outperform competitive algorithms on a wide range of domains.</a>
