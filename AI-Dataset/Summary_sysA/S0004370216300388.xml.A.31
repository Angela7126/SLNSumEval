<a href="#0" id="0">In order to make their decisions, algorithm selection systems need information about the problem instance to solve and the performance of the algorithms in the given portfolio.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The extraction of this information — the features used by the machine learning techniques used for selection — incurs overhead not required when only a single algorithm is used for all instances regardless of instance characteristics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is therefore desirable to extract information as cheaply as possible, thus ensuring that the performance benefits of using algorithm selection are not outweighed by this overhead.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The purpose of our library is to provide all information necessary for performing algorithm selection experiments using the given scenario data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The performance of each algorithm selection model was compared to the virtual best solver (VBS) and the single best solver.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The virtual best solver selects the best solver from {a mathematical formula}A for each instance ({a mathematical formula} ∀ i ∈ I:argmaxa ∈ Am(i,a)).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that the misclassification penalty for VBS is zero by definition.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The single best solver is the actual solver that has the overall best performance on the data set ({a mathematical formula}argmaxa ∈ A ∑ i ∈ Im(i,a)).</a>
