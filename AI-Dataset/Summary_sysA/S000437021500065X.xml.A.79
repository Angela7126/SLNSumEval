<a href="#0" id="0">After the user's preferences selection, in a common first step, Aetheris and {a mathematical formula}CP+Sky automatically identify a smaller set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ which allows for the computation of a concise representation on the patterns thanks to the use of converters (cf.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For that purpose, Aetheris builds a static set of representative patterns according to the set {a mathematical formula}M ′ , which is based on the notion of converting the initial set of preference M (cf.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We propose two operators to automatically build {a mathematical formula}M ′ given the initial set of measures M. Basically, the construction of {a mathematical formula}M ′ consists in identifying primitives that must remain constant in order that minimal or maximal patterns are always dominant patterns.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Distinct operatorGiven a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊆ M, the distinct operator for {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ L with respect to {a mathematical formula}M ′ and {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ { ⊂ , ⊃ } returns all the patterns x of P such that their generalizations (or specializations) are distinct from x with respect to {a mathematical formula}M ′ :{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ { ⊂ , ⊃ }.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ , the set of free (respectively closed) patterns adequate to {a mathematical formula}M ′ corresponds exactly to {a mathematical formula}Dis ⊂ (L,M ′ ) (respectively {a mathematical formula}Dis ⊃ (L,M ′ )).</a>
