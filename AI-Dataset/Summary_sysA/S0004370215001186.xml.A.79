<a href="#0" id="0">We want to study the consequences of using multiple social networks at the same time while maintaining the interaction model as simple and abstract as possible (following the methodology in most opinion dynamics literature).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From the very beginning, our research questions were focused on the collective properties, the structure of the networks involved, and the dynamical outcomes of the simulations: thus leaving out issues related with individual motivations and desired results (either for any individual agent or the society).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The difference between this model and the previous one is that the agents no longer interact in multiple networks at the same time (being able to select any neighbour at a given simulation step).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For smaller values of k, symmetry in the context switching probability (having the same probability in both networks) is more important if the agent switches less from one of the networks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When we increase the number of networks ({a mathematical formula}n â‰¥ 3), the configurations with higher switching probability lead the results to be closer to what happens in context permeability.</a>
