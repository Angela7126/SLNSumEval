<a href="#0" id="0">Using these definitions, the automated process of configuring static sequential portfolios can be defined as follows: Given a set of candidate solvers P and a set of training instances I automatically find the portfolio configuration C of solvers {a mathematical formula}p âˆˆ P such that it maximizes the performance of the resulting portfolio over the given benchmark I.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This approach runs all candidate solvers to be part in the portfolio with every training instance in the same planning domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">And the last one solves a MIP task to compute the optimal sequential schedule of candidate solvers that maximizes the number of solved training instances using 10% of the available time.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, the resulting portfolio achieves the best performance in the training set and minimizes the execution time in that instance set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Third, the MIP task generates the optimal configuration of a static sequential portfolio for the collection of training problems and candidate solvers.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Table A.7 shows the candidate planners considered to compute the OSS portfolio for the sequential optimization track of the IPC 2011 in Section 6.1.1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The set of candidate planners used in Section 6.1.3 to assess the performance of the portfolios computed with gop in optimal planning is shown in Table A.8.</a>
