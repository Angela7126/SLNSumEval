<a href="#0" id="0">Here we define a plan case by a triple, i.e., an initial state {a mathematical formula}s0, a goal g and an action sequence that transits {a mathematical formula}s0 to g. These cases can be seen as providing additional knowledge of the domain over and above the incomplete domain theory.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It begins with the step of collecting sets of predicates P, action schemas A and macro-operator schemas O from incomplete action models {a mathematical formula}A ˜ and plan cases {a mathematical formula}C. In the next two steps, it constructs sets of soft and hard constraints to ensure that the learned domain model can best explain the input plan cases and incomplete action models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Its actions have strong connections with each other with respect to incomplete action models, which suggests these actions are more likely to be successfully executed (i.e., with respect to the complete domain model).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that we define the strength {a mathematical formula} Θ (o) of a macro-operator o as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}#supported_preconditions is the number of preconditions supported by some actions in o, and {a mathematical formula}#preconditions is the total number of preconditions of actions in o.</a>
