<a href="#0" id="0">This example shows that our parallel SMT solving framework can be advantageous over the sequential DPLL({a mathematical formula}T) in two aspects: (1) the search space for interpretations is substantially reduced, as in this running example, the interpretation space for the original problem involves 10 constants while the space for shared interpretations involves only 2, thus the conflicts could be discovered faster, (2) parallel threads share derived interpolants, which enables multiple threads to prune the search space in different manners simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula} Analogously we have {a mathematical formula}M2 ← Unify({a mathematical formula}M2,{a mathematical formula}MS) such that:{a mathematical formula}Next, we collect the shared function applications that have no valuations in {a mathematical formula}MS by calling ExtractSFA({a mathematical formula}M1,{a mathematical formula}M2,{a mathematical formula}MS).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There are two shared function applications: {a mathematical formula}(f, Μ 1) and {a mathematical formula}(f, Μ 2).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since {a mathematical formula}fMS( Μ 1) is defined, the resultant set F consists of one element {a mathematical formula}(f, Μ 2).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The LDC framework is sound and complete, on the premise that the decision procedure terminates.We need to prove the following statement:{a mathematical formula} Then, given arbitrary formula Φ and the size of decomposition k ({a mathematical formula}k>0) such that {a mathematical formula}LDC( Φ ,k) terminates, we wish to prove the following two statements:{a mathematical formula} where the soundness statement can be equivalently transformed as:{a mathematical formula}Suppose {a mathematical formula}LDC( Φ ,k)=unsat holds.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As Algorithm 1 shows, the procedure terminates on either line 5 or 20.</a>
