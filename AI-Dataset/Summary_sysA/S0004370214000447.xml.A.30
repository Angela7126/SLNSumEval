<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we present a new learning algorithm, called HTNLearn, to learn HTN models for HTN planning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An HTN model consists of two parts: (1) a set of HTN methods including method preconditions and method structures (i.e., the method's task and subtasks), and (2) a set of action models, each of which is associated with a precondition list, an add list and a delete list.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the HTNLearn algorithm, we will evaluate the learned HTN methods and the learned action models separately.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, it is possible that our HTNLearn learns more decomposition methods than that in its corresponding ground-truth model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we presented a novel algorithm, HTNLearn, to learn the action models and method preconditions of an HTN model.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given a set of plan traces annotated with partial state information and possibly annotated with partial decomposition trees, HTNLearn builds a set of state, decomposition, and action weighted constraints, and solves them with a MAX-SAT solver.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The solution obtained is the HTN model that best explains the observed input information.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">To the best of our knowledge, HTNLearn is the first algorithm capable of learning all parts of an HTN model, namely, (1) the collection of methods, each indicating the task, subtasks, and preconditions and (2) the collection of action models, each indicating the preconditions and effects.</a>
