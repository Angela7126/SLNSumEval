<a href="#0" id="0">A clear difference of BiGE from these AR-based algorithms is that BiGE uses the idea of Pareto dominance to deal with proximity and diversity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This could be well suited to many-objective optimization where the conflict between proximity and diversity goals is more serious than that in bi- or tri-objective optimization.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Considering the dominance relation of these two goals can provide a good balance between them and lead the algorithm to be less affected by the increase of the objective dimensionality.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Systematic experiments have been carried out by providing extensive comparative studies between BiGE and five state-of-the-art algorithms on four groups of well-defined continuous and combinatorial benchmark suites with 5, 10, and 15 objectives.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Unlike some peer algorithms, which work well on only a fraction of the test problems (e.g., AGE-II and MOEA/D on the 5-objective instances, HypE and NSGA-III on the continuous instances, and FD-NSGA-II on the combinatorial instances), BiGE can achieve a good balance between solutions' proximity and diversity on the test problems with different properties.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In addition, the effect of several parameters on the algorithm was investigated.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Experimental results have indicated the insensitiveness of BiGE to the population size and objective dimensionality and also the effectiveness of BiGE under different settings of the sharing discriminator within a certain range.</a>
