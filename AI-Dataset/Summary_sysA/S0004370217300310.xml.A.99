<a href="#1" id="1">Instead, much of the current work on semantic maps in robotics makes little or no use of this tradition, and has sometimes developed solutions that are entirely independent from the concepts and techniques in AI.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Part of the reason is insufficient mutual awareness between these two fields.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We claim that most of these factors have a common origin: Robots operate in a closed loop with the physical environment, and must necessarily deal with aspects like strict timing, continuous values, complex dependencies and uncertainty; but tools and techniques developed in AI often assume those aspects away.</a>
