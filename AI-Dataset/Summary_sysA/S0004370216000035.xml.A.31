<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}FPNP[log]: class of function problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time by executing a logarithmic number of calls to an NP oracle.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}FP âˆ¥ NP is the class of function problems that can be calculated by polynomial number of parallel calls to a SAT oracle in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The first result shows that minimal sets for predicates of form {a mathematical formula}L can be solved by a logarithmic number of calls to an NP witness-oracle.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For predicates of form {a mathematical formula}B, a minimal set can be computed with a polynomial number of non-adaptive calls to an NP oracle, or, with a logarithmic number of calls to an NP witness-oracle.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Proposition 7 lets us derive that a minimal set for a predicate of the form {a mathematical formula}P can be computed if the number of minimal set is bounded.</a>
