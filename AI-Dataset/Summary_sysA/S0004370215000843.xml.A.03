<a href="#0" id="0">Symbolic representations are undeniably very useful for structuring the knowledge base by providing a “ type system ” and for performing logical and qualitative inference.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our knowledge base only has a rather shallow symbolic representation of general concepts, while most information about the robot, its environment and perceptions is merely a “ virtual knowledge base ” computed at runtime from the data structures of the robot's control program.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One query to the knowledge base may require the use of different inference methods and different information sources.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Among the most important information for a robot are object poses (i.e.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The representation of object poses using MentalEvents provides the information for evaluating qualitative spatial relations between objects over time.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This additional information is important for reasoning about how objects are transformed during a task and for identifying inconsistencies and knowledge gaps.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This query combines information from the action instances with the action and object ontology and the logged continuous movements.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This example shows how logical rules can be formulated in the knowledge base that are evaluated on the object components extracted using geometric analysis.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">At the same time, all components need to be integrated in a coherent knowledge base such that the robot can combine different knowledge sources and inference methods in a single query and integrate their results.</a>
