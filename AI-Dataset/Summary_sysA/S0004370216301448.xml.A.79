<a href="#0" id="0">It is well known that, for sufficiently large m, {a mathematical formula}hm delivers perfect goal distance estimates: simply set m to the number of state variables, reasoning over all relevant conjunctions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We find that the success of our techniques depends on the extent of three structural properties of the input planning task: conflict identification, the ability of forward search to quickly find conflicts and thus enable the learning in the first place; effective learning, the ability to recognize dead-ends with small conjunction sets C; and generalization, the ability of {a mathematical formula}uC to detect states {a mathematical formula}s ′ it was not refined on.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In what follows, like in Equation (1) we use {a mathematical formula}hC(s,G) to denote the {a mathematical formula}hC value of subgoal fact set G, i.e., the approximated cost, given the {a mathematical formula}hC relaxation of achieving G from s. Correspondingly, we use {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ (s,G) to denote the real cost of achieving G from s. The {a mathematical formula}hC recursion path on a current subgoal G is cut off by identifying a small conjunction {a mathematical formula}x ⊆ G that cannot be achieved with action sequences of length at most {a mathematical formula}hC(s,G).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Observe that the only reason for this is generalization, i.e., refinements of {a mathematical formula}uC on states s leading to pruning on states other than s. Without generalization, the search spaces would be identical, including tie-breaking.</a>
