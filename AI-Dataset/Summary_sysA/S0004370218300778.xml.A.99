<a href="#0" id="0">There, in order to determine which information prevails when contradictory information arises, a reliability function was used to obtain a set of agent identifiers which represents the credibility of a given credibility element, and it considers all the agent identifiers involved in every minimal proof of that credibility element.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">They follow a cautious approach: the function first obtains the set with the least credible agent identifiers from each proof, and then, if there exist more than one proof, the most credible identifiers of the resulting set.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, to compute the reliability of a credibility element, they use a function min and a function max.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, based on a credibility base, they define a function such that when given a credibility element in the transitive closure of the credibility base will return a set of agent identifiers that represents the reliability of the credibility element with respect to the credibility base.</a>
