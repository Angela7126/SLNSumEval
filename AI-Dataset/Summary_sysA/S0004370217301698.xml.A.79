<a href="#0" id="0">Consider the problem CSP{a mathematical formula}((Q;<)) where < is the binary order relation of the set {a mathematical formula}Q of rational numbers.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The reader may be puzzled about the restriction to constraint languages containing the relation {a mathematical formula}m. Intuitively, {a mathematical formula}m allows us to define certain relations that make endpoints identical and such relations are the very basis of the dichotomy result (see the construction in the beginning of Lemma 22).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a constraint language Î“ containing such relations, the small solution property for {a mathematical formula}Q follows from the fact that linear programming can be solved (and a concrete solution written down) in polynomial time while the property for {a mathematical formula}Z has been proven by Papadimitriou [57].</a>
