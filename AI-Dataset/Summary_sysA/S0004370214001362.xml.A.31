<a href="#0" id="0">To reduce the problems encountered when using a content-only method for cold-start representations, we have developed a novel approach to learning a pseudo-tag representation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Pseudo-tags are tags that are assigned to a track algorithmically, based on the content representation of the track.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using this method of combining pseudo-tags with tags, we are now able to represent every track by a hybrid vector h. For tracks which are well-tagged, the tag vector will be the main contributor to h, and therefore allow recommendation to be made using the strengths of tag representation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For weakly-tagged tracks, any tags which they have will not be ignored, but instead enhanced by the inclusion of pseudo-tags in h. Recommendations are made using this hybrid representation based on cosine similarity, and will be referred to as Hybrid.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first stage of creating our hybrid representation is to generate pseudo-tags using content-based similarity, and so we aim to examine the quality of these pseudo-tags.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our method for generating pseudo-tags is based on summarising the tag vectors of the K nearest neighbours of a track using Eq.</a>
