<a href="#0" id="0">In this article, we propose a unified approach to semantic similarity that can handle items from multiple linguistic levels, from sense to text pairs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our approach for measuring semantic similarity obtained state-of-the-art performance on several datasets pertaining to different linguistic levels.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Measuring the semantic similarity of pairs of linguistic items can be performed at different linguistic levels.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">At the word level, semantic similarity usually corresponds to the similarity of the closest senses of the paired words [25].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Section 6.3.4 we present our experiments on utilizing the automatically-induced semantic networks in the task of word similarity measurement.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Measures for computing text semantic similarity often operate at the word surface level.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In line 6, Senses(t) returns all senses of the word t and {a mathematical formula}R(sense1,sense2), on the next line, measures the similarity of sense1 and sense2 by leveraging our semantic similarity technique at the sense level.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">So far, the experiments we have reported in this article were those carried out to assess the performance of our system when measuring the semantic similarity of sense and word pairs.</a>
