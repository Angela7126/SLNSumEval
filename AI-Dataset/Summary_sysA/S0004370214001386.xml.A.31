<a href="#0" id="0">The problem addressed in this paper is to find an optimal solution to the MAPF problem.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Optimal solvers are usually applied when the number of agents is relatively small and the task is to find an optimal, minimal-cost solution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This can be formalized as a global, single-agent search problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, the traditional approach for solving MAPF optimally is by using A*-based searches [35], [45].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A node in the search tree consists of the set of locations for all the agents at time t. The start state and goal state consist of the initial and goal locations of the different agents, respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given a graph with branching factor b, there are {a mathematical formula}O(b) possible moves for any single agent and thus the branching factor for an A* search is {a mathematical formula}O(bk) which is exponential in the number of agents.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Naturally, search algorithms that are based on A* can solve this problem optimally, but they may run for a very long time or exhaust the available memory.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The low-level search is given an agent, {a mathematical formula}ai, and the set of constraints associated with {a mathematical formula}ai.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It performs a search in the underlying graph to find an optimal path for agent {a mathematical formula}ai that satisfies all its constraints while completely ignoring the other agents.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The search space for the low-level search has two dimensions: the spatial dimension and the time dimension.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{sup:2} Any single-agent pathfinding algorithm can be used to find the path for agent {a mathematical formula}ai, while verifying that the constraints are satisfied.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We implemented the low-level search of CBS with A* which handled the constraints as follows.</a>
