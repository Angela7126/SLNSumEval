<a href="#0" id="0">In case this computation of {a mathematical formula}H(Y| Π ⁎ ) is not considered worthwhile, or if we simply want a faster approach to prune parent sets, we can resort to a more general version of Theorem 1, as given by Theorem 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Theorem 3 can be used to bound the number of parent sets per variable, even before computing parent sets for them, with the low computation cost of computing the empirical entropy of each variable once (hence overall cost of {a mathematical formula}O(n ⋅ N) time).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Application of Theorem 1 using {a mathematical formula}H(X| Π ⁎ ) in the expression of the rule (instead of the minimization), where X is the variable for which we are building the list and Π is the current parent set being explored.</a>
