<a href="#4" id="4">Next we move on to moves that reduce the size of the extant theory by introducing conflict into the AIF structure and thence the abstract framework.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In (1-a), Proponent presents their conjecture: “ For all polyhedra, {a mathematical formula}V − E+F=2 ” , this corresponds to the Conjecture(C) move in the LG protocol governed by the locution rule L1.1 and structural rule S1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The current state of proof consists now of the conjecture C which adds {a mathematical formula}I1, a first node, to the AIF structure depicted on the left hand side in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">14.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This also adds C as an argument to the {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ framework, and to the abstract argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As there are no conflicts at this stage, C is in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Having introduced the revised lemma, K, the Proponent now performs the ProofDone move to incorporate this new lemma into the proof structure.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The result of this move is to create a new rule of inference, {a mathematical formula}RA6, between the current lemmas ({a mathematical formula}L1, {a mathematical formula}L2, K) and the conjecture (C), this produces a new abstract argument {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ , which replaces Ω as the current proof (Fig.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">21).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The final grounded extension along with the text of each argument, can be seen in Table 5.</a>
