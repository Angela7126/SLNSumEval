<a href="#1" id="1">( Γ ) and CSP{a mathematical formula}( Γ ∪ Dc)are polynomial-time equivalent.Let {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ = Γ ∪ Dc.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The reduction from CSP( Γ ) to CSP{a mathematical formula}( Γ ′ ) is trivial so we concentrate on the other direction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}I ′ =(V ′ ,C ′ ) be an instance of CSP{a mathematical formula}( Γ ′ ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We assume without loss of generality (just as in the proof of Theorem 15) that the only constraints in {a mathematical formula}C ′ with relations from {a mathematical formula}Dc are {a mathematical formula}{d1}(x1), … ,{dm}(xm).Construct an instance {a mathematical formula}I=(V,C) of CSP( Γ ) as follows: let</a>
