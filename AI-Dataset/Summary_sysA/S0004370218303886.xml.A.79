<a href="#0" id="0">Observe that, by using an analogy with monadic second-order logic, the class of full frames corresponds to the basic interpretation of sopml, where any frame is uniquely identified by fixing the set W of worlds and accessibility relations, as the domain D is equal to {a mathematical formula}2W.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proof structure is similar to the one for Lemma 35, namely, we define a sequence {a mathematical formula} Φ 0, Φ 1, … of sets of formulas over {a mathematical formula}AP ∪ Y as follows:{a mathematical formula}We prove by induction on n that every {a mathematical formula} Φ n is consistent (and well-defined).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">EquivalenceGiven a frame{a mathematical formula}F, let ∼ be the equivalence relation on W such that for every state{a mathematical formula}w,w ′ ∈ W,{a mathematical formula}w ∼ w ′ implies that for every{a mathematical formula}U ∈ D,{a mathematical formula}w ∈ Uiff{a mathematical formula}w ′ ∈ U.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Further, denote by{a mathematical formula}[w]={w ′ ∈ W|w ′ ∼ w}the equivalence class of w in{a mathematical formula}F, and for a set{a mathematical formula}U ⊆ W, let{a mathematical formula}[U]be{a mathematical formula}{[w]|w ∈ U}.</a>
