<a href="#1" id="1">The algorithm returns an approximation of the thick set inversion problem{a mathematical formula} 〚 X ⊂ ,X ⊃ 〛 =[f] − 1( 〚 Y 〛 )under the form of 3 subpavings (i.e., union of boxes):{a mathematical formula}Lclear,{a mathematical formula}Lpenumbra,{a mathematical formula}Ldark.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This paper deals with the set-inversion problem {a mathematical formula}X=f − 1(Y) in the case where both f and {a mathematical formula}Y are uncertain, i.e., f belongs to the interval of functions {a mathematical formula}[f − ,f+] and {a mathematical formula}Y belongs to a thick set, i.e., an interval of sets {a mathematical formula} 〚 Y 〛 = 〚 Y ⊂ ,Y ⊃ 〛 .</a>
