<a href="#1" id="1">GroundedWe call {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Lgrounded for O if for each {a mathematical formula}v ∈ L such that {a mathematical formula}O(x ∧ v) ≤ v, it holds that {a mathematical formula}x ≤ v.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We call x a grounded fixpoint of O if it is a fixpoint of O and it is grounded for O.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">The converse of Proposition 3.11 does not hold.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the logic program {a mathematical formula}P:{a mathematical formula} This logic program has as immediate consequence operator {a mathematical formula}TP:{a mathematical formula} The operator {a mathematical formula}TP is anti-monotone, and {a mathematical formula}{p} is strictly grounded for {a mathematical formula}TP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, {a mathematical formula}{p} is not a postfixpoint of {a mathematical formula}TP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The A-Kripke – Kleene fixpoint is the {a mathematical formula} ≤ p-least fixpoint of A and has the property that it approximates all fixpoints of O.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this section, we discuss grounded fixpoints in the context of logic programming.</a>

<a href="#10" id="10">Grounded modelLet {a mathematical formula} Ξ =(S,L,C) be an ADF and {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ L a model of Ξ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We say that X is a grounded model of Ξ if for every set U with {a mathematical formula} ∅ ⊊ U ⊆ X, at least one {a mathematical formula}u ∈ U has support in {a mathematical formula}X ∖ U.</a>
