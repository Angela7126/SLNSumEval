<a href="#0" id="0">Using this definition, a PR algorithm is complete if it returns a hypothesis set H such that {a mathematical formula}h ∼ rh ⁎ → h ∈ H, that is, H contains all possible hypotheses that can be refined to {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A PR algorithm is sound if for every hypothesis {a mathematical formula}h ∈ H → h ∼ rh ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Algorithm 1 receives as input a set of hypotheses with {a mathematical formula}|H| hypotheses.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It iteratively chooses a query and updates the hypothesis set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We will now compute the runtime complexity of each such iteration, given that P is the number of plans in the hypothesis set and {a mathematical formula}maxP is the number of nodes in the largest plan.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let {a mathematical formula}H ′ ⊆ H be the set of hypotheses remaining after convergence of the SPR process.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Any hypothesis that was discarded ({a mathematical formula}h ∈ H ∖ H ′ ) by using complete plans will also be discarded by querying with subplans (and vice versa).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consider the following sets of hypotheses H: (1) {a mathematical formula}Hr(p), the set of hypothesis in H that contain a plan that is a refinement of p; (2) {a mathematical formula}Hm(p), the set of hypothesis in H that contain a plan that is a match of p; and (3) {a mathematical formula}H¬m(p), the set of hypothesis in H that do not contain a plan that is a match of p.</a>
