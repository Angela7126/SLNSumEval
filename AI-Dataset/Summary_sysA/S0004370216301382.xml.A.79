<a href="#0" id="0">The CCLS algorithm is a recent breakthrough in local search for solving MAX-SAT, and shows state-of-the-art performance on solving weighted MAX-SAT.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We would like to note that the CCLS algorithm is designed for solving weighted MAX-SAT.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, when CCLS is applied to solving WPMS, it first translates the WPMS instance into a weighted MAX-SAT instance by setting the weight of each hard clause to the total weight of all soft clauses plus 1 and then solves the translated weighted MAX-SAT instance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The WPM-2014 solver is a SAT-based complete MAX-SAT solver, which successively calls an efficient SAT solver.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As this SAT-based technique is efficient in solving industrial problems and all state-of-the-art MAX-SAT algorithms that perform well on industrial instances are based on this technique [15], it is not surprising that WPM-2014 performs better than CCEHC on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and the pedigree benchmark.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, we conduct more empirical evaluations to study the performance of the combination of the CCEHC algorithm and the unit propagation initialization.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As explained in Section 4, there are three components underlying the EHC heuristic, i.e., the variable selection mechanism focusing on configuration checking based only on the states of hard clauses, the weighting scheme for hard clauses, and the biased random walk component.</a>
