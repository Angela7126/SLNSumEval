<a href="#0" id="0">Consider an assignment problem with two agents with preferences {a mathematical formula}1:{a},{b,c} and {a mathematical formula}2:{a,b,c}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then the assignment in which 1 gets a and 2 gets b and c is possible envy-free.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However it is not SD proportional, because agent 1's allocation does not SD dominate the uniform allocation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}m=nand it is possible to allocate to each agent an object that is not his least preferred object;{a mathematical formula}m>n.Moreover, it can be checked in polynomial time whether a weak SD proportional discrete assignment exists when agents have strict preferences.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">An assignment p is weak SD proportional if and only if for each{a mathematical formula}i âˆˆ N,</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the following assignment problem:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The discrete assignment that gives {a mathematical formula}{b,c,f} to agent 1 and {a mathematical formula}{d,e,a} to agent 2 is SD proportional.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However it is not Pareto optimal since it is SD-dominated by the assignment in which agent 1 gets {a mathematical formula}{a,b,c} and agent 2 gets {a mathematical formula}{d,e,f}.</a>
