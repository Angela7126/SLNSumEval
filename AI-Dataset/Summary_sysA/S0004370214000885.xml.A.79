<a href="#0" id="0">Given such an instance of Permutation Sum, we create a manipulation problem with {a mathematical formula}m=q+3 candidates {a mathematical formula}p,a1 … ,aq+2 where the preferred candidate of the two manipulators is p. By Lemma 1, we can construct an election in which the non-manipulators cast votes to give the score vector for {a mathematical formula} 〈 p,a1, … aq+2 〉 of:{a mathematical formula} for some {a mathematical formula}C ≥ 0 and {a mathematical formula}y ≤ C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that, as Reverse never uses more than one additional manipulator than is optimal, it will successfully find a 3-manipulation.Largest Fit will first give the highest scores, {a mathematical formula}m − 1, from both manipulators to the preferred candidate.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the first step, Average Fit will assign a score of 2 to candidate {a mathematical formula}c3 and will continue to do that as long as the average of candidate {a mathematical formula}c3 is greater than that of candidate {a mathematical formula}c2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider an election in which the manipulators wish candidate {a mathematical formula}c8 to win, and 8 non-manipulators have voted as follows:{a mathematical formula} This gives the score vector for {a mathematical formula} 〈 c1, … ,c8 〉 of:{a mathematical formula} On this problem, Largest Fit finds an optimal manipulation that makes the final candidate win but Average Fit requires an additional vote.</a>
