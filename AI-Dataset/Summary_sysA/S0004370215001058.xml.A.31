<a href="#4" id="4">An {a mathematical formula}( Α , Θ )-solution set to an SCSP {a mathematical formula}P is a set of policy trees.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">All policy trees in this set simultaneously provide, with probability at least Α , a satisfaction probability greater than or equal to {a mathematical formula} Β i − Θ for every chance constraint {a mathematical formula}hi in {a mathematical formula}P with satisfaction threshold {a mathematical formula} Β i.</a>
