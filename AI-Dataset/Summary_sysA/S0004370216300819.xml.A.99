<a href="#0" id="0">A partial policy, in this context, is a function {a mathematical formula} Π :S → 2A that maps a state into a set of possible actions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We define this function formally as follows: let {a mathematical formula} Π (L) be the set of minimal plans of cost (in our case length) up to L for a given planning problem, then{a mathematical formula} is the partial policy that returns, for each state in the MDP, the set of actions that belong to at least one minimal plan in the corresponding state of the model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We define this reduced MDP {a mathematical formula}Dr= 〈 S,Ar,fr,r 〉 , based on the original {a mathematical formula}D= 〈 S,A,f,r 〉 where the actions available are restricted to those returned by the partial policy:{a mathematical formula} The transition function is defined from the one of D:{a mathematical formula} but it is undefined for actions {a mathematical formula}a ∉ Ar(s).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While the partial policy (and therefore the model {a mathematical formula}Dm) determines the possibility to choose a given action in a particular state, the probability distribution over the next state is unmodified for the actions that are available.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, an action can make the current state transition into a state that is not what {a mathematical formula}Dm predicts: if the agent takes action a in state s, it can land in a state {a mathematical formula}s ′ such that {a mathematical formula}s ′ ∉ o − 1(fm(o(s),a)).</a>
