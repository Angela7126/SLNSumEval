<a href="#0" id="0">We briefly review results on Monte Carlo approximation of the least hypervolume contributor as well as the exact hypervolume algorithm.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The contributing hypervolume of an individual {a mathematical formula}a âˆˆ A is given by{a mathematical formula} Note that the contributing hypervolume of a dominated individual is zero.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The contribution {a mathematical formula}CON(a,A) is an important measure since instead of using the hypervolume directly, most hypervolume-based algorithms such as the steady-state MO-CMA-ES or the SMS-EMOA remove, in the selection step, the individual{a mathematical formula} contributing the least hypervolume to the population A.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This can be done by {a mathematical formula}(|A|+1) hypervolume calculations with one of the many available hypervolume algorithms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In our experiments we want to compare this exact calculation of the hypervolume with an approximation algorithm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Though CON is therefore not approximable in time polynomial in {a mathematical formula}|A| and m, there are still a few approximation algorithms for CON (see [2], [8], [11]).</a>
