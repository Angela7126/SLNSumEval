<a href="#0" id="0">We create 2V requests at first decision epoch.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each zone {a mathematical formula}Zi is the origin zone of two requests with one request having destination in {a mathematical formula}Zi and one request having destination in {a mathematical formula}Zi ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Requests having origin in {a mathematical formula}Zi at decision epoch 1, can only be assigned server from the zone {a mathematical formula}Zi.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}D1={<Zi,Zi,1>,<Zi,Zi ′ ,1>} and {a mathematical formula}f(Zi,1)={Zi}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">All the requests at the first decision epoch have unit revenue.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If zone i server is assigned to the request between zone pairs {a mathematical formula}<Zi,Zi> then the variable {a mathematical formula}xi is true else if it is assigned to the request between zone pairs {a mathematical formula}<Zi,Zi ′ > then {a mathematical formula}xi is false.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If the zone {a mathematical formula}Zi server is assigned to the request having destination in zone {a mathematical formula}Zi then the variable {a mathematical formula}xi is true else if it is assigned to the request having destination in the zone {a mathematical formula}Zi ′ then {a mathematical formula}xi is false.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Requests served at the first decision epoch determine the value of variables {a mathematical formula}xi.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Therefore, at the second stage, server will be available in the zone {a mathematical formula}Zi if {a mathematical formula}xi is true, and will be available in zone {a mathematical formula}Zi ′ if {a mathematical formula}xi is false.</a>
