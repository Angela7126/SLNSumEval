<a href="#0" id="0">We can now define a STPUD planning problem P as a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 V,I,T,A,G 〉 where:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In general, our translation rewrites a STPUD problem {a mathematical formula}P= ˙ 〈 V,I,T,G,A 〉 into a new planning instance {a mathematical formula}P ′ = ˙ 〈 V ′ ,I ′ ,T ′ ,G ′ ,A ′ 〉 that does not contain actions with uncontrollable duration.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The {a mathematical formula}transmit action has only one effect: {a mathematical formula} 〈 [ettrans]sent:=T 〉 and no other action nor TIL can change the {a mathematical formula}sent variable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, no action has a condition that depends on {a mathematical formula}sent, hence general condition (1) is satisfied.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, general conditions (2) and (3) are trivially satisfied because the {a mathematical formula}transmit action has no ending conditions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, all the conditions are satisfied and the example problem can be simplified as follows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula} The resulting simplified problem now has one uncontrollable action and one controllable action, without any additional variables or conditions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Moreover, each plan for the resulting problem corresponds to a strong plan for the original problem (with the obvious removal of durations for the simplified actions in the plan).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given a strong plan Σ , let{a mathematical formula} Χ = ⋃ s ∈ Σ snap(action(s)).</a>
