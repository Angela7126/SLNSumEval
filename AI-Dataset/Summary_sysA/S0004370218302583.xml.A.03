<a href="#1" id="1">Again, player {a mathematical formula}mj has to be matched against all four of the players in {a mathematical formula}Gj that he can beat.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Player {a mathematical formula}mj now beats {a mathematical formula}dj and {a mathematical formula}mj ′ amongst the available players.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Player {a mathematical formula}dj only beats two other players, therefore {a mathematical formula}mj will beat him in the third round.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Player {a mathematical formula}mj is left with only one player to beat to get to the fifth round which is {a mathematical formula}mj ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Player {a mathematical formula}mj ′ can and needs to reach the fourth round.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}mj therefore needs to beat him to get to the second round and therefore that player is no longer available.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This is possible if and only if each player {a mathematical formula}mj ∈ M can win a 16-player subtournament that consists exactly of the players stated in Lemma 3.</a>
