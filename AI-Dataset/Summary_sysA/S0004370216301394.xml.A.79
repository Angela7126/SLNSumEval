<a href="#0" id="0">These methods have a common modus operandi to determining the experiment {a mathematical formula} Θ t at time step t: construct a utility function {a mathematical formula}ut based on the posterior GP conditioned on the queries so far; then maximise {a mathematical formula}ut to determine {a mathematical formula} Θ t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Equation (3) says that we should choose the point that results in the highest reduction in divergence if we knew the likelihood and the true posterior at that point.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In NED, we choose the point with the highest expected reduction in divergence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the next evaluation we choose the point that minimises the expected divergence between these models and the next estimate.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The density h is sampled from {a mathematical formula}F Θ |Xobs, the uncertainty model of the posterior obtained by adding {a mathematical formula}( Θ +,p+) to the set of already available points {a mathematical formula}At − 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, our work demonstrates that when likelihood evaluations are expensive, such as in scientific simulations, treating posterior estimation in an active regression framework enables us to be significantly query efficient.</a>
