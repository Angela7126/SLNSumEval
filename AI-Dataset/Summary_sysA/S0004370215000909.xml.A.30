<a href="#0" id="0">1, {a mathematical formula}vkmax denotes the maximum fitness variance in the local neighborhood of all trial solutions in the current population for the kth objective with {a mathematical formula}k=[1,N].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The noisy version of the kth objective {a mathematical formula}fk(X → ), of any trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → , is given by{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Η k represents the injected stochastic noise amplitude that follows a certain probability distribution function (PDF).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The following five variants of {a mathematical formula} Η k are considered here:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The mean and standard deviation of the HVR metric for 50 independent runs (each with 300,000 FEs for a 30-dimensional problem) of each of the ten algorithms are presented in Table 8 with {a mathematical formula} Η k as Gaussian noise (mean 0 and variance 0.4).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Close inspection of Table 8 indicates that the performance of the proposed DENMO algorithm remained consistently superior to that of the other noisy MOO algorithms with respect to the HVR metric.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We have proposed a novel approach to management of uncertainty during ranking the trial solutions due to possible creeping of noise in the fitness landscapes of a MOO problem.</a>
