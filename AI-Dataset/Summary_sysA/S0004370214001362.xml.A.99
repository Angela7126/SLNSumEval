<a href="#0" id="0">This increased number of pseudo-tags over the typical number of tags can provide problems when computing similarity between a pseudo-tag vector and tag vector, and so only the most relevant pseudo-tags should be selected.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using this method of combining pseudo-tags with tags, we are now able to represent every track by a hybrid vector h. For tracks which are well-tagged, the tag vector will be the main contributor to h, and therefore allow recommendation to be made using the strengths of tag representation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For weakly-tagged tracks, any tags which they have will not be ignored, but instead enhanced by the inclusion of pseudo-tags in h. Recommendations are made using this hybrid representation based on cosine similarity, and will be referred to as Hybrid.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To further examine how this dynamic generation of a hybrid representation affects recommendation, we show the results by the number of tags a query has, in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The reason that Hybrid is able to achieve this higher quality is because of the pseudo-tags that are embedded into the representation.</a>
