<a href="#0" id="0">This process is called separation, as the added constraints separate the relaxed solution from the space of valid solutions, and the added constraints are known as cuts or cutting planes as they cut off a portion of the search space containing the relaxed solution.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this approach, after the relaxed problem has been solved, additional linear constraints are added to the problem which separate the current relaxed solution from the space of any valid integer solutions, i.e.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The search for the relaxed solution and the addition of extra constraints alternates until no more cuts can be found.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For a network with {a mathematical formula}|V| nodes, there are {a mathematical formula}2|V − 1| − 1 cluster constraints; rather than initially adding such a large number of constraints, they are only added explicitly to the problem as cuts if a relaxed solution would violate them.</a>
