<a href="#0" id="0">For example, if the model makes predictions about the actions of the modelled agent,{sup:1} then the modelling agent can incorporate those predictions in its planning procedure to optimise its interaction with the modelled agent.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In essence, this method maintains a set of “ cases ” along with the observed actions of the modelled agent in each encountered case.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Similar case-based methods for modelling the behaviour of other agents were proposed by Borck et al.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, an agent model may make predictions about more abstract properties such as whether the play style of the modelled agent is “ aggressive ” or “ defensive ” (e.g.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While the modelling methods discussed in the previous sections do not model such nested beliefs, methods of recursive reasoning use explicit representations of nested beliefs and “ simulate ” the reasoning processes of other agents to predict their actions.</a>
