<a href="#0" id="0">In the remainder of this section we will present models for the core combinatorial structure of the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal and the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax, using a variety of optimization techniques (LS, MINLP, CP, and SMT).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We refer to each model with the notation {a mathematical formula}Tp(h), where T identifies the solution technique, and p the problem type (bal for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal and max for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Core model for Local Search The Local Search model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is identical to the base model presented in Section 3, and reported here for convenience:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Core model for MINLP A MINLP model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal can be obtained from the base model by linearizing the objective function:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula} We did not design a MINLP model for our second example problem, because we have not defined a technique for encoding in MINLP a Decision Tree, i.e.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">the Empirical Model that we employ for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax (see Section 7).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The training set for the example problems For our dispatching problems, we learn a different Machine Learning model for each core.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Results for the{a mathematical formula}WDPbal We obtained a LS approach based on the ACPI model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal by inserting the {a mathematical formula}hACPI(x) function into the core Local Search model from Section 6.</a>
