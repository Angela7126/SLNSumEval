<a href="#0" id="0">Then {a mathematical formula}GI is a complete graph, whereas there are no edges, but loops, in {a mathematical formula}GCI.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consequently, {a mathematical formula} Α (GI)=1 whereas {a mathematical formula} Α (GCI)=|V|.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is worth noticing that in our context, the bigger the independent set, the higher the chance to filter variable domains.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, using {a mathematical formula}GCI is presumably better than using {a mathematical formula}GI to filter AtMostNValue when difference constraints figure in the model (Proposition 2).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To illustrate the interest of {a mathematical formula}GCI, we now use it on our example, with {a mathematical formula}d(z)={1,2,3}, in Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The main difference between the two data sets is related to {a mathematical formula}z ⁎ |T|, which has an average value of {a mathematical formula}39% and {a mathematical formula}83%, respectively for Data_100 and Data_137.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Regarding input data only, {a mathematical formula}|S||T| is 2.2 times bigger in Data_100 than in Data_137.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, Data_100 instances have on average more available shifts per task than Data_137, but they use a significantly smaller percentage of these shifts in optimal solutions.</a>
