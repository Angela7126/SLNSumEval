<a href="#0" id="0">We look at how the properties of different network models influence the convergence to opinion consensus.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the next section, we present the work related to opinion dynamics, social space modelling and complex network models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The social context of an agent is thus a set of neighbours currently available for interaction at a particular network or set of networks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We study the notion of context permeability in different simulation models in which agents interact using a simple consensus game.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The social networks used in our models are k-regular and scale-free.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Adding more networks to the social space is not the same as creating a single network with twice the number of connections.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We can then say that specific configurations display a specific average path length and clustering coefficient both for k-regular networks and scale-free networks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">These are similar to the results we get for k-regular networks (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The convergence ratio is very low for the configurations with one network {a mathematical formula}d=2 and 2 networks with {a mathematical formula}d=1; hence the high number of encounters (see also Table 3).</a>
