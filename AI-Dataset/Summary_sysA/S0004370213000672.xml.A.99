<a href="#0" id="0">Because of {a mathematical formula}(par9 ̲ ), it is sufficient to show that {a mathematical formula}set( Δ ) ⊆ par Τ ̲ (set( Α ∧ Δ i),set( Β ∧ Δ i),set( Γ )) for each i.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since these elements from {a mathematical formula}domains( Δ ) are assumed to be orthogonal to the elements of {a mathematical formula}domains( Α ) ∪ domains( Β ) ∪ domains( Γ ) ∪ domains( Δ ), however, the latter inclusion follows easily from the definition of {a mathematical formula}par Τ ̲ , given that we already know that {a mathematical formula}set( Δ ) ⊆ par Τ ̲ (set( Α ′ ),set( Β ′ ),set( Γ )).The case where {a mathematical formula}(par11 ̲ ) is entirely analogous to the case for {a mathematical formula}(par8 ̲ ) in the proof of Proposition 9.The case where {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Δ → Γ ▷ Τ 〈 Α , Β 〉 was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par12 ̲ ) is trivial.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now we assume that {a mathematical formula}set( Δ ) ⊆ par Τ ̲ (set( Α ),set( Β ),set( Γ )) and show that {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Δ → Γ ▷ Τ 〈 Α , Β 〉 can be derived from the inference rules {a mathematical formula}(par1 ̲ ) – {a mathematical formula}(par ̲ 12).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If either of Α , Β or Γ is inconsistent, then we must have that {a mathematical formula}set( Δ )= ∅ , i.e.</a>
