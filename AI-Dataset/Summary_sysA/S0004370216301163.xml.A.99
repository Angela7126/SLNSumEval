<a href="#0" id="0">The first important observation here is that, by Lemma 10, the representation {a mathematical formula} Ξ ([ ↕ ] Ψ ) is unique.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The second important observation is that (assuming that it is defined) each {a mathematical formula} Φ n+1 is a consistent theory, since they are of the form {a mathematical formula} Φ n+ Ψ with {a mathematical formula}¬ Ψ ∉ Φ n.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">So if {a mathematical formula}¬ Ξ ([ ↕ ] Ψ ) ∈ Φ n then there must be some {a mathematical formula} Ξ ([U] Ψ ) ∉ Φ n, as otherwise closure under (R4) would imply that {a mathematical formula} Ξ ([ ↕ ] Ψ ) ∈ Φ n.</a>
