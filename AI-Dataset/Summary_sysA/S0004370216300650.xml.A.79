<a href="#0" id="0">Then it is not hard to see that the following is a contradiction for any constraint {a mathematical formula}c(x,y → ):{a mathematical formula} or, equivalently, that the following implication is valid:{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula}X denote the set of values of x which have no support in {a mathematical formula}Dy ‾ ′ :{a mathematical formula} Instantiating (15) with {a mathematical formula}c1 ∧ 2 for c and with {a mathematical formula}X for S yields the inference rule that we call Combine:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is not hard to see that the consequent is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}xor(y → )=xor(z → ), and hence also to {a mathematical formula}xor(y → ,z → ,1), which brings us to the desired rule:{a mathematical formula} Note that variables that are shared by {a mathematical formula}y → and {a mathematical formula}z → can be removed from the xor predicate without changing its value.</a>
