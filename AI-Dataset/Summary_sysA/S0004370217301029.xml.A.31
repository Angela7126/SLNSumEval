<a href="#1" id="1">To train {a mathematical formula}Cs(s,a) and {a mathematical formula}Ps(s,a,s ′ ,C(s,a)), we recruited 30 Computer Science undergraduate students, ranging in age from 18 to 34 (mean=25, s.d.=3.4) with similar demographics to participate in a simulated SAR task equipped with a naïve advising agent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given state s, our naïve agent provided advice a which, upon completion, is expected to bring about a new state {a mathematical formula}s ′ , where {a mathematical formula}Rs(s ′ )+5s<Rs(s).</a>
