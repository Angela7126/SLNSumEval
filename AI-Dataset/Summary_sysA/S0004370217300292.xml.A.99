<a href="#0" id="0">Assume otherwise that {a mathematical formula}(x,q¯) is not an equilibrium; we will show that {a mathematical formula}(x,q) should not be an equilibrium as well.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since {a mathematical formula}(x,q¯) is not an equilibrium, there must exist some i such that buyers of type i are assigned to a vendor j in x and satisfy {a mathematical formula}vij ′ − q¯j ′ >vij − q¯j for some vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ that is empty in x.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From the definition of {a mathematical formula}q¯, this means that {a mathematical formula}vij ′ − cj ′ >vij − qj and vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ could set its price to a sufficiently small but strictly higher than its production cost price to attract the buyers of type i and increase its utility from 0 (since {a mathematical formula}j ′ is an empty vendor according to x) to positive; this contradicts the assumption that {a mathematical formula}(x,q) is an equilibrium.</a>
