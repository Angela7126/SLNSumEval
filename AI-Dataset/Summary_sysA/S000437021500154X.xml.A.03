<a href="#1" id="1">This theorem proves that BiSS correctly predicts the optimal solution cost when {a mathematical formula} Γ =1.0 and the number of probes goes to infinity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Intuitively, a single probe of BiSS is able to produce a perfect prediction of the optimal solution cost when using a type system that has goal types and obeys Equation (1) for all nodes s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ of the same type, and when {a mathematical formula} Γ =1.0.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For larger values of Γ BiSS will overestimate the optimal solution cost when {a mathematical formula}p=1 so its signed error will be positive.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">BiSS uses the {a mathematical formula}Tc type system with the Out of Place heuristic to predict the optimal solution cost of the instances in I.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">BiSS used the {a mathematical formula}Tgc type system with MD to predict the optimal solution cost of the instances in I.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">BiSS uses the {a mathematical formula}Tc type system described above in Appendix A.4.</a>
