<a href="#0" id="0">Here we define a plan case by a triple, i.e., an initial state {a mathematical formula}s0, a goal g and an action sequence that transits {a mathematical formula}s0 to g. These cases can be seen as providing additional knowledge of the domain over and above the incomplete domain theory.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We note that since the incomplete model {a mathematical formula}M ˜ is not necessary an abstraction of the complete domain, a plan correct w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the first phase, we learn macro-operators and action models with the given plan cases {a mathematical formula}C and the incomplete domain {a mathematical formula}M ˜ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It begins with the step of collecting sets of predicates P, action schemas A and macro-operator schemas O from incomplete action models {a mathematical formula}A ˜ and plan cases {a mathematical formula}C. In the next two steps, it constructs sets of soft and hard constraints to ensure that the learned domain model can best explain the input plan cases and incomplete action models.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We denote the resulting set of plan cases by {a mathematical formula}C ′ .</a>
