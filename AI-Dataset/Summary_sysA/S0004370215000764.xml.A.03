<a href="#0" id="0">texplore-vanir combines model learning through the use of random forests with two unique intrinsic rewards calculated from this model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Section 4 presents the texplore-vanir algorithm, including its approach to model learning and how its intrinsic rewards are calculated.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition, it shows that the agent can use the intrinsic rewards in conjunction with external rewards to learn a task faster than if using external rewards alone.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The agent can plan a policy to reach intrinsic rewards added into its model to drive exploration to interesting state-actions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This agent should use intrinsic rewards to 1) efficiently learn a useful model of the domain's transition dynamics; and 2) explore in a developing curious way.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These results demonstrate that the intrinsic rewards and model learning approach texplore-vanir uses are sufficient for the agent to explore in a developing curious way and to efficiently learn a transition model that is useful for performing tasks in the domain.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These intrinsic rewards are combined with the same texplore model learning approach as the other methods.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Not only should the agent's intrinsic rewards be useful when learning in task without external rewards, they should also make an agent in a domain with external rewards learn more efficiently.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, in a task with external rewards, texplore-vanir can use its intrinsic rewards to speed up learning with respect to an algorithm using only external rewards.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These results demonstrate that the intrinsic rewards and model learning approach texplore-vanir uses are sufficient for the agent to explore in a developing curious way and to efficiently learn a transition model that is useful for performing tasks in the domain.</a>
