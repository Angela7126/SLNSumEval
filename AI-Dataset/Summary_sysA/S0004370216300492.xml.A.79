<a href="#0" id="0">In a space {a mathematical formula}Rn with the Euclidean distance metric, convexity of a set S is defined by the property that {a mathematical formula} ∀ x,y ∈ S, every point on the line segment connecting x and y is also in S. A detailed discussion is given [19] citing experimental evidence for the fact that concepts as used by humans tend to be convex, and that the use of convex concepts requires less cognitive load.</a>
