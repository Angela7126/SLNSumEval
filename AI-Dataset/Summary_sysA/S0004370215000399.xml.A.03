<a href="#4" id="4">In this work, we set {a mathematical formula} Α =0.5 to favor neither Frequency nor MatchCoverage.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When {a mathematical formula} Α =0.5, we can use MatchFmeasure to identify an order relation for individuals by which we can determine whether one individual is better than another.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">if {a mathematical formula}UIR(A,B)>0.25, then an observed improvement of individual A over B in MatchFmeasure where {a mathematical formula} Α =0.5 is robust.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Next, we will perform a comparison by experiments among the baseline alignments, which set the weights of each similarity measures as {a mathematical formula}1/num (num is the number of similarity measures) and the threshold as 0.80, and the alignments obtained by MA using MatchFmeasure only and those by MA using both MatchFmeasure and UIR.</a>
