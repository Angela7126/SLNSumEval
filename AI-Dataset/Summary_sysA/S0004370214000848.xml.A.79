<a href="#0" id="0">Because convergence to {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ is not feasible in the general case, one solution is to find a value function {a mathematical formula}V ˆ that is at most Ε away from {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ , i.e., {a mathematical formula}|V ˆ (s) − V ⁎ (s)| ≤ Ε for all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S[2], [12].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a state s, FF-Hindsight performs the following three steps: (i) it randomly generates a set of nonstationary deterministic problems {a mathematical formula}D starting from s; (ii) it uses FF to solve them; and (iii) it combines the cost of their solutions to estimate the true cost of reaching a goal state from s. Each deterministic problem in {a mathematical formula}D has a fixed horizon and is generated by sampling one outcome of each probabilistic action for each time step.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Formally, suppose that a short-sighted SSP {a mathematical formula}Ss,t generated in line 6 of Algorithm 5 has an avoidable dead end (i.e., there exists at least one proper policy Π for {a mathematical formula}Ss,t) thus {a mathematical formula}sd ∉ Ss,t Π for all dead end states {a mathematical formula}sd ∈ Ss,t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since an optimal policy {a mathematical formula} Π Ss,t ⁎ is computed for {a mathematical formula}Ss,t (line 7), then {a mathematical formula} Π Ss,t ⁎ is one of the existing proper policies by the definition of optimal policies; therefore, the avoidable dead ends are not reached by executing {a mathematical formula} Π Ss,t ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For instance, the {a mathematical formula}(s0,16)-short-sighted SSP {a mathematical formula}Ss0,16 associated with problem 4 of the triangle tire world contains {a mathematical formula}124436 states, and {a mathematical formula}Ss0,16 is generated and solved on every iteration of line 5 of Labeled-SSiPP (Algorithm 4), even after inferring that {a mathematical formula}Ss0,16 also contains only one proper policy.</a>
