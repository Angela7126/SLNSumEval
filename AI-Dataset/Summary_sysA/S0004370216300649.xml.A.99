<a href="#0" id="0">The main difference is that the relation between the modularity of their generated instances and the parameter p is not so clear as in our model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, we force link clauses to connect variables of distinct communities, and we do not require communities to have the same number of internal clauses.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to analyze the community structure of the SAT instances obtained with our model, we have generated some sets of random formulas for different values of {a mathematical formula}Q ∈ {0.9,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.3} (hence {a mathematical formula}p=Q+1/c), and for different values of number of communities {a mathematical formula}c ∈ {10,20,40,80}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Notice that the main goal of this experiment is to show that our model generates instances with modularity {a mathematical formula}Q ′ and number of communities {a mathematical formula}c ′ similar to the input parameters Q and c, for any number of variables n and clauses m. We use the algorithm described in [9] to compute an approximation of {a mathematical formula}Q ′ and {a mathematical formula}c ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We validate the adequacy of this model checking that (i) the community structure of the resulting formulas is the expected, (ii) if there exists a phase transition point dependent on the clause/variable ratio, then it is independent on the modularity, and (iii) the SAT solvers performances are consistent to the structure of the formulas generated by our model, i.e.</a>
