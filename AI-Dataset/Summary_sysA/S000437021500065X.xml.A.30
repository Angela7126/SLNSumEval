<a href="#0" id="0">Skypattern operatorGiven a pattern set {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ L and a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M, a skypattern of P with respect to M is a pattern not dominated by any pattern in P with respect to M. The skypattern operator {a mathematical formula}Sky(P,M) returns all the skypatterns of P with respect to M:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Problem 1</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M, the skypattern mining problem is to evaluate the query{a mathematical formula}Sky(L,M).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a set of measures{a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M,{a mathematical formula}Sky(L,M)=Sky(P,M)for any pattern set P such that{a mathematical formula}Sky(L,M) ⊆ P,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let us consider patterns from {a mathematical formula}T that maximize the frequency and area measures: {a mathematical formula}M={freq,area}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The mining process can focus on only extracting patterns based on the frequency measure (i.e.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}M ′ ) without having to take into account the area measure that is present in M.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Indistinct operatorGiven a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊆ M, the indistinct operator returns all the patterns of {a mathematical formula}L being indistinct with respect to {a mathematical formula}M ′ with at least one pattern in P.{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For instance, from Table 1a, the set of patterns that have exactly the same frequency as patterns B or C is {a mathematical formula}Ind(L,{freq},{AB,AC})={B,C,AB,AC}.</a>
