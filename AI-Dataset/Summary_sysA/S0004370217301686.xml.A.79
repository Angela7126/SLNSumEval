<a href="#0" id="0">As shown below, the only important feature to have to make a correspondence between a FA and the fact that ∘ satisfies the weakened AGM Postulates is that there is a minimal model for {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T in {a mathematical formula}Mod(T ′ ) as expressed by Theorem 1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A formula relaxation based on Ρ , denoted {a mathematical formula} Ρ F Ρ is defined as follows, for any two complex concepts C and D, any individuals {a mathematical formula}a,b, and any role r:{a mathematical formula} Note that the relaxation of the role assertion axiom amounts to delete it from the knowledge base, since a tautology is satisfied by any model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Formula relaxation based on concept retractionA formula relaxation based on a concept retraction Κ , denoted {a mathematical formula} Ρ F Κ , is defined as follows, for any two complex concepts C and D, any individuals {a mathematical formula}a,b, and any role r:{a mathematical formula} Similarly, the relaxation of the concept assertion amounts to delete it from the knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For every knowledge base T, let us define the binary relation {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T ⊆ Mod×Mod by: for all {a mathematical formula}M,M ′ ∈ Mod,{a mathematical formula}Let us first show that {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T satisfies the two conditions of FA.</a>
