<a href="#1" id="1">We assume a fixed semantic function Δ below.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus when we say that {a mathematical formula}(s,s ′ ) is a transition of T, we mean that {a mathematical formula}(s,s ′ ) ∈ Δ (T).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We list below some interesting properties about Δ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our first property is that the states in a transition must satisfy every static causal rule.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Static causal rules are state constraintsIf{a mathematical formula}(s,s ′ )is a transition of a causal action theory{a mathematical formula}(S,D), then for every static causal rule{a mathematical formula}(l,G)in S, we have that{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">both s and{a mathematical formula}s ′ satisfy the static causal rules in S (Property 1),</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">both s and{a mathematical formula}s ′ satisfy the static causal rules in S (Property 1),</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our first result shows the correspondence between action language {a mathematical formula}B and permissible mappings that satisfy Property 1, Property 3, Property 4.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the last section, we described a translation from our causal action theories to causal theories in action language {a mathematical formula}B.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">for each static causal rule{a mathematical formula}(l,G),{a mathematical formula} Ξ Bs(l,G)is the set of rules consisting of constraints(6)and(7)and the following rule{a mathematical formula}</a>
