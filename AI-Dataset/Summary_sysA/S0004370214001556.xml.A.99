<a href="#0" id="0">The direct coupling between knowledge and action also has undesirable implications for situated agents reasoning about their own knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a consequence of using regression to handle knowledge queries, one can only reason about knowledge if one has a situation term rooted in {a mathematical formula}S0, as the required query is:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given an explicit account of the observations made by each agent, the required semantics of the K relation are clear: {a mathematical formula}K(agt,s ′ ,s) must hold whenever {a mathematical formula}s ′ is legal, both s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ would result in the same view for the agent, and s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ are rooted at K-related initial situations:{a mathematical formula}</a>
