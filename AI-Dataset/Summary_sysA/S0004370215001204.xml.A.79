<a href="#0" id="0">Thus the problem is in co-NP.For the inductive step assume that the claim holds for {a mathematical formula}k − 1 and consider the input {a mathematical formula}(B,I,V) with an interpretation I, value bound V and a max-k-alternating diagram {a mathematical formula}B=maxw1 ⁡ minw2 ⁡ … QwkAB(w1, … ,wk) where in order to simplify the notation each {a mathematical formula}wi may be a single variable or a set of variables and we use the boldface notation to denote this fact.Now for each tuple i of domain objects in I (which is appropriate for the number of variables in {a mathematical formula}w1) let diagram {a mathematical formula}B ′ be {a mathematical formula}B ′ =minw2 ⁡ … QwkAB(w1=i, … ,wk).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The claim then follows because the prefix includes all variables and there is a 1 – 1 correspondence in truth values for substitutions in group 1.For the inductive step, the valuation v covers the first {a mathematical formula}j − 1 blocks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A legal interpretation embeds the binary interpretation {a mathematical formula}I ⁎ from the previous proof and in addition includes a truth setting for all the variables in the first ∀ block of the QBF.</a>
