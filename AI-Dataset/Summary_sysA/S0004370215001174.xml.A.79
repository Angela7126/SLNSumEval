<a href="#0" id="0">Some studies have measured task complexity [15] and two main classes of approaches have been considered: subjective methods, where the difficulty of a task is measured by involving users who are asked to accomplish the task, and objective methods, where such features as the number of components and the relationship between them are identified and measured.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In summary, by monitoring the results provided by the data collected from the team scores, the competition organizers can check the progress of the results over the years, control the average scores and the standard deviation of each functionality, and make strategic decisions to change the rules to adjust the difficulty of the tasks and the functionalities based on the desired goals of the competition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Even though many steps have addressed the former (e.g., releasing packages under ROS and working on a special distribution for collecting all components for RoboCup@Home), the latter still remains a matter for future work (for example, defining a Standard Platform that has been proven to considerably increase the interest of other research groups in other RoboCup leagues â€” especially in soccer).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Provide a good balance between pre-defined tests and open demonstrations.We identified the importance of providing a good balance between pre-defined tests, where the desired skills need to be shown in desired robustness and efficiency, and open demonstrations, where teams can show cutting edge research results and problems that have not yet been addressed in the design of pre-defined tests.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The conducted statistics and evaluation of scores (and the subsequent amendments of the rules that define the competition) show that RoboCup@Home is on track to support integrated robotic systems that safely interact with environments and people.</a>
