<a href="#0" id="0">Let us consider two trial solutions {a mathematical formula}X → i and {a mathematical formula}X → j of a MOO problem where all N objectives need to be minimized.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In a MOO, a trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → ⁎ is said to be nondominated if there is no {a mathematical formula}X → that dominates {a mathematical formula}X → ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">1, {a mathematical formula}vkmax denotes the maximum fitness variance in the local neighborhood of all trial solutions in the current population for the kth objective with {a mathematical formula}k=[1,N].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Fitness interval selection in the sample space: We first record the variance {a mathematical formula}Vk(X → i) of the measured samples of the kth fitness of trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → i.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We measure the contribution of the fitness samples of the interval j to the fitness estimate of the trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → i by a probability measure {a mathematical formula}pj:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}nk,ij represents the number of samples of {a mathematical formula}fk(X → i) in the jth interval for {a mathematical formula}j=[1,L].</a>
