<a href="#0" id="0">A detailed analysis of the competition results that provides insights into the performance of state-of-the-art planners from different perspectives such as coverage, quality, CPU time, and memory usage.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This focuses on good plan quality, with less emphasis on the number of problems solved or the CPU time used.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Accordingly, if two planners find solutions within the same time and memory bounds, the plan with the lower cost is awarded a better score.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is not applicable to the optimization track, for which all solutions are expected to have the same cost and thus only the number of solutions found (or coverage) is relevant for the final score.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, the following planners were distinguished by their performance in the sequential optimal track of IPC-2011:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The following subsections examine the performance of entrants in the temporal satisficing track under the usual parameters: number of problems solved, quality, CPU time, and memory management.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In 2008 the winner of the sequential satisficing track was lama-2008 and a refined version of this planner was entered in IPC-2011.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, this version was compared with the current winner, lama-2011, instead of the version submitted in 2008.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Again, the analysis in this section shows that, overall, the planner that won IPC-2011 improves on the performance of the IPC-2008 winner for the problems chosen for IPC-2011 in terms of coverage, quality, and raw speed.</a>
