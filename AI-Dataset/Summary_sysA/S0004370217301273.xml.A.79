<a href="#0" id="0">We say that l is strictly derived from X wrt K, denoted by {a mathematical formula}X ⊢ Kl, iff {a mathematical formula}l ∈ X or l is the conclusion of an argument constructed according to Definition 2 where in step 1 only elements from {a mathematical formula}Xdom are used and in step 2, only the strict rules from K are used.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}E ′ be the set of all arguments generated by E. It is clear that</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore there exists no regular attack relation assignment for {a mathematical formula}CK.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The normal attack relation assignment{a mathematical formula}attsnr is defined by: For any knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ R and any arguments {a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ ARK, {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ attsnr(K) if and only if A undercuts B or A normal-rebuts B.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence from Lemma 7, it follows that all regular properties except the effective rebut one are satisfied.Since the set {a mathematical formula}{a,b} is inconsistent, there is no knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ CR such that {a mathematical formula}{a,b} ⊆ BEK.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For extended rule-based systems, we define normal attack relation assignments in the same way as before, namely, for any extended knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ ER and any arguments {a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ ARK, {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ attsenr(K) if and only if A undercuts or undermines B or A normal-rebuts B where the definition of normal-rebuts is the same like in section 5.2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Suppose every attack relation assignment {a mathematical formula}atts ∈ A satisfies the inconsistency-resolving property.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From Theorem 1, it follows immediately that {a mathematical formula}atts0 also satisfies the inconsistency-resolving property.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let {a mathematical formula}attsnr ′ be the normal attack relation assignment wrt {a mathematical formula}R ′ .</a>
