<a href="#0" id="0">For convergence to an efficient allocation by means of IR deals, {a mathematical formula}nm − 1, with n being the number of agents and m being the number of goods, is known to be a (tight) upper bound on the longest path, i.e., there exist profiles of valuation functions and initial allocations such that it is possible to visit all allocations before convergence [29].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Inspection of the proof of that result shows that it does not depend on the payment scheme used.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, observe that under the payment scheme of Theorem 8, which is characterised by Inequality (2), the envy-freeness condition {a mathematical formula}ui(A(i), Π (i)) ⩾ ui(A(j), Π (j)) is equivalent to the following inequality (which must hold for any two agents i and j):{a mathematical formula} To prove the claim of the theorem, we give an example with two agents and two goods, where Inequality (3) fails to be satisfied for the unique efficient allocation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence, as negotiation by means of IR deals is bound to lead to that efficient allocation, and as the payment scheme is fixed, this will show that the final allocation cannot be envy-free.</a>
