<a href="#0" id="0">Based on the mapped values, we define meta feature templates in {a mathematical formula}FM for dependency parsing.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The meta feature templates are listed in Table 2, where {a mathematical formula}fb is a base feature of {a mathematical formula}FB, {a mathematical formula}hp refers to the part-of-speech tag of the head and {a mathematical formula}hw refers to the surface word of the head.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The empirical statistics of the feature sizes at Section 3.4.2 show that the number of meta features is only 1.2% of base features.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We use an example to demonstrate how to generate the meta features based on the meta feature templates.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, we have the three meta features “ {a mathematical formula}[MTk] ” , “ {a mathematical formula}[MTk],VV ” , and “ {a mathematical formula}[MTk],ate ” , where VV is the part-of-speech tag of the word “ ate ” .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, a new tagger is trained with the base features and the meta features on the training data.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The feature templates are listed in Table 15, where {a mathematical formula}fb is a base feature.</a>
