<a href="#0" id="0">He showed that, in the propositional case, there exists an aggregate context such that disjunctive programs can be converted into normal logic programs with aggregate atoms under this context.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We further proved that this is the case for all non-convex aggregate context, both in the propositional case and in the first-order case.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a consequence, convex aggregates exactly draw a boundary of the expressive power as well as computational complexity of aggregates in normal logic programs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">That is, in the propositional case, the complexity of checking the answer set existence for normal logic programs with any convex aggregate atoms is NP-complete, which is the same as that for normal logic program without aggregates.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In contrast, the complexity of checking the answer set existence for normal logic programs under any non-convex aggregate context is {a mathematical formula} Î£ 2P-complete, which is on a higher complexity level.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the first-order case, our result shows that normal logic programs with any convex aggregate atoms can be converted into first-order logic with the same type of aggregates (see Theorem 1), while this can never be done for normal logic programs under any non-convex aggregate context providing some general assumptions in the complexity theory (see Theorem 2).</a>
