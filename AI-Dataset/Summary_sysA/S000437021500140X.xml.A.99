<a href="#0" id="0">BayesAct is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process or POMDP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The key contributions of this new theory are: (1) to represent sentiments as probability distributions over a continuous affective space, thereby allowing these sentiments to be dynamic and uncertain; (2) to propose a new kind of agent based on affect control theory that has the ability to learn affective identities of interactants; (3) to integrate the affective dynamics proposed by affect control theory with standard POMDP-based artificial intelligence; and (4) to introduce explicit utility functions to affect control theory that parsimoniously trade-off affective and propositional goals for a human-interactive agent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Full results are shown in Appendix C. To enable comparisons with Interact, we use action selection according to our generalised affect control principle only, using an average of 100 samples from Equation (32).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If the prior over {a mathematical formula} Θ f is such that we expect identities to stay constant over time, as in Equation (25), we can derive a similar expression to (A.5), except it now includes the deflections of the fundamentals over identities:{a mathematical formula} We see that this is now significantly different than (A.5), as the relative weights of Ξ ({a mathematical formula} Β a and {a mathematical formula} Β c) and Ψ ( Α ) will play a large role in determining which fundamental sentiments are most likely.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table D.7, Table D.8, Table D.9, Table D.10 show the results of the survey designed to map specific expressions (e.g., “ Aww, come on, that was too hard for me! ” ) to corresponding behaviour labels (e.g., “ whine to ” ).</a>
