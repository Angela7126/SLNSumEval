<a href="#0" id="0">All these aspects of the law, i.e., its orientation to future and not fully anticipated situations, the tension between the general terms of the law and the particulars of a case, and the adversarial nature of legal procedures, make that legal reasoning goes beyond the literal meaning of the legal rules and involves appeals to precedent, principle, policy and purpose, and involves the attack as well as the construction of arguments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Classifying the facts under legal concepts involves interpretation in a broad sense, i.e., the ampliative reasoning process which, on the basis of legal sources, determines the content of legal norms and concepts (legal interpretation in a strict sense, i.e., the attribution of a meaning to a specific legal provision in cases of doubt is an aspect of that).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, when deriving legal consequences from the classified facts, the main modes of reasoning are deductive but with room for nonmonotonic techniques to deal with exceptions to rules, either statutory or based on principle and purpose, and to choose between conflicting rules on the basis of the general hierarchy of legal systems, with rules from different sources.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Argument schemes (in some approaches formalised as schemes for defeasible rules) turned out to be useful as a bridge between human and computational modes of argument.</a>
