<a href="#0" id="0">By Proposition 9, we know that {a mathematical formula}CB(E) has converged if and only if {a mathematical formula}T ∧ K is uniquely satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If T is satisfiable, then testing whether {a mathematical formula}T ∧ K is uniquely satisfiable can be done by checking whether for each constraint {a mathematical formula}c ∈ B, the positive literal {a mathematical formula}a(c) or negative literal {a mathematical formula}¬a(c) over c is entailed by {a mathematical formula}T ∧ K.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By Definition 6, we also know that the clauses generated at Line 6 or at Line 7 yield a correct representation of {a mathematical formula}CB(E).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">So, by Theorem 5, the invariant of the main loop is that T is always satisfiable.The set N only contains nogoods that represent inconsistent sets of constraints.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, N cannot lead to the deletion of any concept from the version space, except the inconsistent concept (which, by assumption, is not the target concept).</a>
