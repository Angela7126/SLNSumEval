<a href="#0" id="0">The results show that increasing Ε results in a lower quality health state.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This demonstrates the expected tradeoff between the number of diagnoses used to generate a health state and its quality.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Indeed, we already observed this tradeoff for the wasted effort metric in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Considering the results in Table 9, Table 10, we observe that in practice the difference in quality between Oracle value and the health state obtained using all the diagnoses ({a mathematical formula} Ε =0) is relatively small.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For all quality metrics, only a small subset of all diagnoses are needed to reach a Ε -stable health state.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A small fraction of the diagnoses is needed to generate a health state that has almost the same quality as the health state generated by all diagnoses, for all the proposed quality metrics (wasted effort, AUC, and Euclidean distance).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, a high-quality health state can be found with only a subset of all minimal cardinality diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Table 13, Table 14 show the ratio of minimal cardinality diagnoses (where 1 corresponds to all minimal cardinality diagnoses) required on average, to reach a Ε -stable health state using AUC and Euclidean metrics respectively.</a>
