<a href="#0" id="0">First, for the purpose of completeness, we provide a background introduction of SMT and topic modeling, more details about bilingual term extraction, especially how we pair monolingual terms into bilingual terms based on word alignments, as well as more details about how we calculate the proposed term translation consistency model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Instead of simply counting the number of times of a term translation being used in previously translated sentences, we enable the decoder to detect terms that are highly consistently translated under given topics in training data with the proposed model, and encourage the decoder to translate these terms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On average, a source term has about 1.70 different translations ({a mathematical formula}1.81M/1.08M â‰ˆ 1.68).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These statistics indicate that terms are frequently used in real-world data and that a source term can be translated into different target terms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Second, we also present some bilingual term examples extracted from the training data in Table 15.</a>
