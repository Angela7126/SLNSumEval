<a href="#1" id="1">Find-Acceptable-Plan's parameters consist of a nondeterministic planning domain D, its determinization {a mathematical formula}D¯, an initial state {a mathematical formula}s0, a set of goal states G, a classical planner CP, and a set U of states to avoid.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}O ⁎ contains an abstraction of each planning operator o in D;</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Having shown termination, we can now show that Find-Acceptable-Plan returns failure or returns an acyclic plan whose policy image avoids the states in U.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As shorthand, we call these plans U-acceptable.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">More formally, a plan p is U-acceptable in a state s with respect to a nondeterministic domain D, its determinization {a mathematical formula}D¯, a classical planning problem {a mathematical formula}(D¯,s,G) and a set of states U if:</a>
