<a href="#0" id="0">We consider the correctness of MCheck({a mathematical formula}M,w, Φ ) to be immediately clear, but it remains to show that it requires at most polynomial space.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The second important observation is that (assuming that it is defined) each {a mathematical formula} Φ n+1 is a consistent theory, since they are of the form {a mathematical formula} Φ n+ Ψ with {a mathematical formula}¬ Ψ ∉ Φ n.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Firstly, suppose that {a mathematical formula}[U][ ↕ ] Ψ ∈ Φ .</a>
