<a href="#1" id="1">Differently from {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin, they have a special inclusion operator for DIs but no equivalent of N. They satisfy the Rational closure axioms and are subject to inheritance blocking, like {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin (Example 6, Example 30 are not dealt with correctly).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The translation of {a mathematical formula}DLN knowledge bases into equivalent classical knowledge bases (26), (27), (28) constitutes one of the simplest accounts of nonmonotonic inferences and overriding introduced so far: DIs are applied in decreasing priority order, checking their consistency with higher priority DIs without any further complication.</a>
