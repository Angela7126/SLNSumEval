<a href="#0" id="0">In view of the objective of comparing participant systems in a uniform setting, this edition of the ASP Competition did not include a Model&Solve track, but took place in the spirit of the former System track: it was open to any general-purpose solving system, provided it was able to process ASP-Core-2 programs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The general input – output format followed the 2013 edition, so that previous System track submissions should (in principle) be able to participate again.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the 2013 edition still made exceptions and admitted problem encodings in legacy formats, while the Fifth ASP Competition insisted on ASP-Core-2 compliance.</a>
