<a href="#0" id="0">we present a combined task – motion planning algorithm that implements geometric backtracking;</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Task planning querying motion planning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In these approaches, a task plan is generated, and some of the actions involve motion planning problems which are solved by dedicated motion planners or other geometric reasoners.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Each motion planning problem is solved immediately, when the action is applied by the task planner.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A hybrid planning domain is a tuple {a mathematical formula}D= 〈 O,C,Pred,N,holds,ref 〉 , where: O is a set of action schemas; C is a representation of the geometric state space according to Section 3.1; Pred is a set of predicates; N is a set of constants (names); and holds and ref are as above.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For six unfeasible problem instances out of 17 (instance {a mathematical formula}i32a cannot be found to have no solution without constraint propagation given the time bound), there is a significant speedup owing to constraint propagation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For all instances except one, most of the geometric reasoning time is spent on computing paths, and the part of time spent on propagating geometric constraints is insignificant in comparison.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For one single instance ({a mathematical formula}i21a), there is a significant slowdown of the planning process owing to constraint propagation, since planning finishes without having called RRT (i.e., the first action of the plan cannot be geometrically grounded).</a>
