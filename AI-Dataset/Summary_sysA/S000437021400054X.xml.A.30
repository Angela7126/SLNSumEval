<a href="#0" id="0">Consider the logic program {a mathematical formula} Π 2 in Example 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By Definition 2, the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I={p( − 1),p(1)} is an FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 2, where {a mathematical formula}ground( Π 2)= Π 2 and {a mathematical formula}f Π 2I={r2,r3}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By Theorem 2, it is immediate that a model I of a logic program Π is an answer set of Π if and only if for each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I, {a mathematical formula}lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − )) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Every answer set I of a logic program Π is a minimal model of Π and furthermore, a minimal model of the FLP reduct{a mathematical formula}f Π I.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that for a model I of a normal logic program Π , {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) is a set of ground atoms; by Definition 9I is a well-justified FLP answer set of Π if and only if {a mathematical formula}I=lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, by Corollary 1 the well-justified FLP answer set semantics coincides with the standard answer set semantics and thus coincides with the FLP answer set semantics.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given a propositional logic program Π , deciding whether Π has an FLP answer set or a well-justified FLP answer set is both{a mathematical formula} Σ 2p-complete.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This establishes the first equivalence.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">From this and since every well-justified FLP answer of an arbitrary logic program Π is an FLP answer of Π (Corollary 2) and every FLP answer set of Π as a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}f Π I also must be a minimal model of Π , the second equivalence follows.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then, Π has no (resp.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">an) FLP or well-justified FLP answer set if and only if p belongs to every (resp.</a>
