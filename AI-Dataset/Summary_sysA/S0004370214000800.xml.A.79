<a href="#0" id="0">In order to effectively combine the two prediction functions v and {a mathematical formula}wt at the t-trial of the online learning task, we introduce two combination weighting parameters, {a mathematical formula} Α 1,t and {a mathematical formula} Α 2,t, for the two prediction functions respectively.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To overcome the challenge of parameter selection for {a mathematical formula}Pi, in this paper, we propose an automated parameter selection technique, an Online Window Adjustment (OWA) algorithm as shown in Algorithm 5, which can automatically determine a proper value for window size parameter {a mathematical formula}Pi during the online learning process.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition, the proposed HomOTL-I and HomOTL-II algorithms achieve the best performance among all datasets, which implies that the exploiting learnt knowledge from source domain is able to boost the performance of traditional online learning algorithms, and the two kinds of weight updating methods are generally comparable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Similar observations show that the two OTL algorithms achieve the best performance after receiving a small number of examples (e.g., less than 100 examples), which implies these two strategies can efficiently transfer the well-learnt knowledge from the source task to the target task.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Second, among all the compared algorithms, we observe that the proposed HetOTL algorithm always achieves the best performance (or at least very close to the best performance, e.g., “ landmine1 ” and “ landmine2 ” ) when C is sufficiently large (e.g., {a mathematical formula}C>4).</a>
