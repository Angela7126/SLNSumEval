<a href="#0" id="0">Using these definitions, the automated process of configuring static sequential portfolios can be defined as follows: Given a set of candidate solvers P and a set of training instances I automatically find the portfolio configuration C of solvers {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P such that it maximizes the performance of the resulting portfolio over the given benchmark I.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each candidate solver {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P is executed with every training instance {a mathematical formula}t ∈ I to obtain the sets {a mathematical formula}Spt of solutions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In case of solving problems optimally or SAT problems, a candidate solver {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P generates at most one solution {a mathematical formula}s ∈ Spt for each training instance {a mathematical formula}t ∈ I, since s should be optimal (as in the case of Automated Planning) or because it is required only to find a single solution — as in the case of SAT.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Although the usual goal for configuring portfolios is to maximize the overall solution quality or the number of solved instances, we considered an objective function that maximizes a weighted sum of overall running time (the sum of {a mathematical formula}timep for all solvers p) and quality of the solutions (quality).</a>
