<a href="#0" id="0">A clause C is called 1-provable with respect to a CNF formula Φ , if {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ ¬C ⊢ 1 ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A clause C is thus 1-provable if it is an implicate of C and the fact that C is an implicate can be proved using unit propagation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The notion of 1-provability was introduced in [15].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A formula Φ is called unit refutation complete if every implicate C of Φ is 1-provable with respect to Φ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The notion of unit refutation completeness was introduced in [26] and later inspired the definition of propagation completeness in [9], which we give in the following subsection.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let C be an empowering implicate of a formula Φ which is not 1-provable.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This means that if we falsify all the literals in C and add them to Φ , thus producing {a mathematical formula} Ψ = Φ ∧ ¬C, then we get a contradiction which is not provable by unit resolution.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Proof</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">From Theorem 4.2 it follows that there is an empowering 1-provable implicate {a mathematical formula}C Φ of Φ with an empowered literal ℓ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ denote the formula which originates from Φ after adding unit clauses formed by negated literals from {a mathematical formula}C Φ , i.e.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula} Φ ′ ≡ Φ ∧ ¬C Φ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Since {a mathematical formula}C Φ is 1-provable it follows that {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ ⊢ 1 ⊥ , i.e.</a>
