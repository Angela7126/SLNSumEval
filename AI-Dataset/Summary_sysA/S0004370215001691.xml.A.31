<a href="#0" id="0">In this context, computing the Top-k closed itemsets of length at least min corresponds to computing the Top-k models of {a mathematical formula} Φ ≡ (1) ∧ (2) ∧ (3) with respect to {a mathematical formula} ⪰ B and {a mathematical formula}X={pa|a ∈ I}, where {a mathematical formula}B={b0, … ,bn − 1} and {a mathematical formula} ⪰ B is defined as follows: {a mathematical formula}M ⪰ BM ′ if and only if {a mathematical formula}|M(B)| ≤ |M ′ (B)|.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This preference relation means that a model {a mathematical formula}M is more preferred than a model {a mathematical formula}M ′ if the itemset {a mathematical formula}{a ∈ I|M(pa)=1} is more frequent than {a mathematical formula}{a ∈ I|M ′ (pa)=1}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is a Δ -preference relation since one can define the bound function {a mathematical formula} Δ ⪰ B Φ as follows:{a mathematical formula} Indeed, this formula allows us to have models corresponding to closed itemsets with supports greater than or equal to the support of the closed itemset obtained from {a mathematical formula}M.</a>
