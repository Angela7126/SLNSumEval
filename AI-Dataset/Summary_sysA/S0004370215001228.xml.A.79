<a href="#0" id="0">Hence we have shown that, given (R1), the theory {a mathematical formula}K ⁎ Φ is split between {a mathematical formula}P Χ and {a mathematical formula}P Χ ‾ for all {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ L Χ .Continuing with the proof of strong (P), we define ⋄ to be the following local (to {a mathematical formula}L Χ ) revision operator: for any theory H of {a mathematical formula}L Χ and any sentence {a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ L Χ , {a mathematical formula}H ⋄ Γ =(Cn(H) ⁎ Γ ) ∩ L Χ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To elevate Theorem 2 to the general case, we first need to extend the definition of Diff to cover comparisons between a world r and an arbitrary, possibly incomplete, theory K. An obvious candidate would be the set {a mathematical formula} ⋃ {Diff(w,r):w ∈ [K]}; let us denote this set as {a mathematical formula}Diffall(K,r).</a>
