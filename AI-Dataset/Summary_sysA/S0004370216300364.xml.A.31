<a href="#0" id="0">The second function receives an offer vector {a mathematical formula} Ω → which specifies the issue values for all the negotiation issues of a new offer recently received from the opponent.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That is, as soon as a new offer is received from the opponent, this function is invoked to update the model based on this newly received bid.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It updates the estimated preference profile of the opponent by adjusting {a mathematical formula}evaliOP( Ω i) and {a mathematical formula}wi values (Algorithm: lines 18 and 21).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Whenever a new offer is received from the opponent, the perceptron learning delta rules (Algorithm: lines 18 and 21) are repeated N times.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The {a mathematical formula}EstimatedUtilityOP( Ω → ) is a function which receives an offer as the input and returns the estimated utility value of that offer in the opponent's utility space as the output.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the setting adopted in Experiment I (Section 5.1.1), the accuracy of this proposed model is evaluated together with other opponent models through a Pearson Correlation between the estimated and real bid utilities [38]:{a mathematical formula} where, {a mathematical formula}uOP is the real utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ is the estimated utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP( Ω → ) is the real utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space, and {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ ( Ω → ) is the estimated utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space.</a>
