<a href="#0" id="0">To this end, let {a mathematical formula} ∂ st be the set of all shortest paths from s to t, and analogously let {a mathematical formula} ∂ st(v) ⊆ ∂ st be the set of shortest paths from s to t that pass through node v.{sup:10} Now, using the expected value of the Bernoulli random variables (10) and (11) we are able to compute the Shapley value of node v, which is the expected marginal contribution of v to {a mathematical formula}P Π (v), as:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Interestingly, the above equation provides insight into the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality; it is a combination of two factors: Firstly, the summation on the left resembles the standard betweenness centrality, but scaled by the number of nodes that belong to each shortest path.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In weighted graphs, the pair-dependency limited to the shortest paths consisting of i nodes is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} This limited pair-dependency measures the influence of all shortest paths between s and t consisting of i nodes on the evaluation of node v. Note that the value of the function {a mathematical formula}f Δ ⁎ depends solely on the number of nodes lying on the shortest paths between s and t.</a>
