<a href="#0" id="0">There must be a well-defined process to exclude irrelevant information in physical reasoning, and it is hard to see how this exclusion process itself can rely on simulation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If there is a human in the loop, they can examine the output of the simulator and at least see that this cannot be right, particularly if the simulator outputs an animation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If there is no human in the loop, then it would be very desirable for the physical reasoning system to be able to detect these kinds of problems by itself.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Simulation is effective for automated physical reasoning when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of scales involved, both temporal and spatial, is not extreme.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For simulation to serve as a general solution to the problem of physical reasoning, in either human or automated form, all would need to be solved.</a>
