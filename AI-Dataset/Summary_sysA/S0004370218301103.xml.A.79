<a href="#0" id="0">SPR problemAn SPR problem is defined by a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,H0 〉 , where L is a plan library and {a mathematical formula}H0 is a set of hypotheses that explain some observation sequence with respect to L. A solution to the SPR problem is an SPR process with a query policy that decides which plans to select in order to reduce the size of {a mathematical formula}H0 with as few queries as possible.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If the query result is False, then the entropy of the resulting hypothesis set is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} Recall that {a mathematical formula} Φ (H,p,False) is the set of all hypotheses such that none of their plans can be refined to be p (Equation (3)).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the Entropy policy, we need to compute for each plan p the entropy of the hypothesis set with and without p. To compute the updated hypothesis set {a mathematical formula} Φ (H,p,True) (Equation (2)) we need to go over all plans in H and check whether they are refinements of p. A naive implementation of checking whether a plan {a mathematical formula}p ′ ∈ H is a refinement of p (Definition 6) is to exhaustively check if there exists a sequence of refinement methods that can be applied to p to obtain {a mathematical formula}p ′ .</a>
