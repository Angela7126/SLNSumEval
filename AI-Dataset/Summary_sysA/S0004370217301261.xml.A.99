<a href="#0" id="0">We would like the algorithm to make the decision on whether to evaluate {a mathematical formula}h2 rationally.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, we define a criterion based on the regret for bypassing {a mathematical formula}h2(n) in this context.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We define regret here as the value lost (in terms of expected increased run time) due to bypassing the computation of {a mathematical formula}h2(n), i.e., how much runtime is increased due to bypassing the computation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We wish to compute {a mathematical formula}h2(n) only if this regret is positive.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One important distinction between {a mathematical formula}RLA ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}RLIDA ⁎ is the immediacy of the feedback about whether {a mathematical formula}h2 was helpful.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}RLIDA ⁎ can tell whether {a mathematical formula}h2 was helpful immediately after evaluating it — {a mathematical formula}h2 is helpful iff {a mathematical formula}g(n)+h2(n)>T, thereby causing a cutoff.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, we simply estimate {a mathematical formula}ph2 by the frequency of observed helpful evaluations of {a mathematical formula}h2 so far.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For {a mathematical formula}RLA ⁎ , things are a bit more complicated, as we do not have immediate feedback about whether {a mathematical formula}h2 was helpful.</a>
