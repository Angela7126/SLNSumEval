<a href="#0" id="0">To better illustrate the workings of subdimensional expansion, we present an example for multirobot path planning on graphs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Planning is done using the {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ algorithm, an implementation of subdimensional expansion that uses {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ as the underlying planner.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section the {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ algorithm will be described in detail.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}M ⁎ is an implementation of subdimensional expansion for multirobot path planning when the configuration space of each robot can be described by a graph.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}M ⁎ uses {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ [1] as the underlying planner, because {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ is optimal, meaning it finds optimal paths, and complete, meaning that it will take finite time to either find a path or determine that no path exists.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}M ⁎ will be shown to have the same optimality and completeness properties as {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The section will end with a discussion of the performance of {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ .</a>
