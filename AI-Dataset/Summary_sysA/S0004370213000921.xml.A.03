<a href="#0" id="0">The third contribution concerns improving local search algorithms for random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although the SAT community has made great achievements in solving random 3-SAT instances in the past two decades, the progress lags far behind on random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Specifically, our analysis shows that the CC strategy is effective for random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k<6 and ineffective for those with {a mathematical formula}k ⩾ 6.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also show that the subscore based tie-breaking mechanism is ineffective for random 3-SAT instances, although it is very effective for random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This section improves Swcca for random k-SAT with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that the PAWS scheme is adopted by state-of-the-art SLS algorithms for SAT such as Sparrow2011 [3] and EagleUP [15], which show better performance than Swcca on random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Encouragingly, CCAsubscore exhibits much better performance than all these four solvers on both benchmarks, indicating a remarkable progress in solving random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Specifically, CCASat adopts Swcca to solve random 3-SAT and structured instances, and CCAsubscore to solve random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For a random k-SAT formula {a mathematical formula}Fk(n,m), we calculate the size of each variable ʼ s neighborhood in F as following.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As indicated in Table 14, for random 6-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}n<1500 and 7-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}n<5000, each variable ʼ s neighborhood consists of more than half of the variables in the formula.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We specially remark that the CC strategy degrades to the tabu method with {a mathematical formula}tt=1 for random 7-SAT instances at {a mathematical formula}r=85 with {a mathematical formula}n<564.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">By utilizing subscore to break ties in the CCA framework, CCAsubscore achieves much better performance on random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3 than existing SLS solvers do.</a>
