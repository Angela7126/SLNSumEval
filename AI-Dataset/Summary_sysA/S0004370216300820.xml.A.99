<a href="#0" id="0">In our recent work [16], we proposed a method that exploits the structural knowledge derived from semantic networks, together with distributional statistics from text corpora, to produce effective representations of individual word senses or concepts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Secondly, each vector represents a concept, irrespective of its language, in a unified semantic space having concepts as its dimensions, permitting direct comparison of different representations across languages and hence enabling cross-lingual applications.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this article, we improve our approach, referred to as Nasari (Novel Approach to a Semantically-Aware Representation of Items) henceforth, and extend their application to a wider range of tasks in lexical semantics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We put forward an approach that allows us to plug in an arbitrary word embedding representation with that of our lexical vector representations, providing three main advantages: (1) benefiting from the word-based knowledge derived as a result of learning from massive corpora for our sense-level representation; (2) reducing the dimensionality of our lexical space to a fixed-size continuous space; and (3) providing a shared semantic space between words and synsets (more details in Section 4), hence enabling a direct comparison of words and synsets.</a>
