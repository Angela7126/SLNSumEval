<a href="#0" id="0">First, for the purpose of completeness, we provide a background introduction of SMT and topic modeling, more details about bilingual term extraction, especially how we pair monolingual terms into bilingual terms based on word alignments, as well as more details about how we calculate the proposed term translation consistency model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Instead of simply counting the number of times of a term translation being used in previously translated sentences, we enable the decoder to detect terms that are highly consistently translated under given topics in training data with the proposed model, and encourage the decoder to translate these terms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We compared our term translation consistency model against an alternative consistency method that rewards hypotheses with repeated terms from previously translated sentences.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also observe 1) that topic information improves the model as term translation consistency is topic-sensitive and 2) that modeling how terms are translated consistently in training data is better than counting the number of times that they are translated consistently in a test set.</a>
