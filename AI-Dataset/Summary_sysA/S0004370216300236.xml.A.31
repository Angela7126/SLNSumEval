<a href="#0" id="0">Our definition of correctness is with respect to the type distribution ϒ : beliefs are said to be correct if they assign the same probabilities to true types as ϒ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This requires that the beliefs can point to the types in the support of the type distribution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, the results in this section pertain to a situation in which the user knows that the true type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ must be a subset of the hypothesised type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Formally, we assume:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We specified a total of 10 different methods to automatically compute prior beliefs {a mathematical formula}Pj for a given set of types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ :</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In our analysis, we will sometimes assume that the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We can show that Property 1 holds if the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i with positive expected payoff in X.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We can show that Property 2 holds if the type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i which lead to states into which X may get as well.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We can show that Property 3 holds if the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i which X might have chosen as well.</a>
