<a href="#0" id="0">Relation to {a mathematical formula}FNP//OptP[log]Literature introduces the class {a mathematical formula}FNP//OptP[log], which is characterized by a polynomial nondeterministic Turing machine that is given advice in the form of an optimum for certain function [10].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So for instance, MaxSAT could be computed in this class similarly as in proof of Proposition 1, i.e.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This section extends the results of Section 4 to the case when it is known that there are exactly k minimal sets, for some constant k. Given the results of previous sections, form {a mathematical formula}P is the only predicate form of interest, since function problems represented with predicates of either form {a mathematical formula}L or {a mathematical formula}B can be solved with a logarithmic number of witness oracle calls (see Fig.</a>
