<a href="#0" id="0">In this article, we are mainly interested in analyzing the results of competitions over the years.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, we focus on how this analysis has been carried out in the last years within the RoboCup@Home competition, which is the largest competition for domestic and service robots.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The evaluation of a competition's effectiveness based on the scores of the teams over the years is important for better fueling the competition and the novel approach introduced in RoboCup@Home for addressing this issue is the main contribution of this article.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Although our analysis reported in this article is specific to the RoboCup@Home competition, we believe that its principles can be applied both to other existing competitions and to new ones, and it could even be used for evaluating multi-year projects or challenges in AI and robotics where some tasks are repeated and changed over the years.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The evaluation of a competition's effectiveness based on the team scores is thus a novel approach introduced in RoboCup@Home and is the main contribution of this article.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Moreover, the evaluation methodology applied in RoboCup@Home might help both existing competitions and new ones as well as multi-year projects or challenges in AI and robotics where some tasks are repeated and changed over the years.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">After the first two years of RoboCup@Home competitions (2006 â€“ 2007), we discussed how to evaluate the performances in terms of measuring the improvements demonstrated by the teams in the tests over the years.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since we strongly believe that cognition is an important ability for service and domestic robots, we will encourage the competition more in this direction in the near future and thus we expect more interesting results from RoboCup@Home teams.</a>
