<a href="#0" id="0">A solution to a scheduling problem is called a schedule and is usually given in the form of an assignment Σ of starting times {a mathematical formula} Σ (e)=te to events e.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using this characterization of our new flexibility metric flex, we will now show how to compute the flexibility {a mathematical formula}flex(S) of an STN S.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">an interval schedule {a mathematical formula}IS={[lt,ut]|t ∈ T} for S, such that</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By the definition of {a mathematical formula}IS there is a schedule Σ for S such that {a mathematical formula} Σ (tj)=utj and {a mathematical formula} Σ (ti)=lti.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">But this is immediate as by construction of {a mathematical formula}C ′ , {a mathematical formula}tj+ − ti − ≤ cij is a constraints in C and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ is a schedule for {a mathematical formula}S ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the STN {a mathematical formula}S2 presented in Example 1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">According to our intuition, its flexibility should be equal to {a mathematical formula}flex(S2)=5.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We show that {a mathematical formula} Σ i is a valid schedule for {a mathematical formula}Si.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">So consider an arbitrary constraint {a mathematical formula}t − t ′ ≤ c ∈ Ci.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then {a mathematical formula}z − t ′ ≤ c ∈ Ci.</a>
