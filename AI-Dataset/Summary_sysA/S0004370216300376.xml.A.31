<a href="#0" id="0">In order to analyze the performance of the solvers with and without prior preprocessing in more detail, we carried out the following experiments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We ran Bloqqer on all 345 instances in the benchmark set eval2012r2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From all these instances, 276 remained unsolved by Bloqqer.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We ran each solver twice: once on the 276 instances after they have been preprocessed by Bloqqer, and once on the respective 276 original instances from the set eval2012r2 without preprocessing.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">That is, in this experiment we exclude instances from the set eval2012r2 that were solved already by Bloqqer.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">According to the results shown in Table 12, the largest number of instances in the eval2012r2 were solved with the sequence ABCD.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Based on this observation, we ran the sequence ABCD on the other benchmark sets for at most six rounds.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Table 13 shows the results of these experiments.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Except for the set qbf-hardness, incremental preprocessing solves considerably more instances than the individual preprocessors (Table 11).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For example, for the sets planning-CTE and conformant-planning, 57% and 23% more instances are solved, respectively.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Table 16, Table 17 show the performance of solvers on the two benchmark sets.</a>
