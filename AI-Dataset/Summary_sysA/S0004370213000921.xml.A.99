<a href="#0" id="0">The variable property score is defined as {a mathematical formula}score(x)=cost(F, Α ) − cost(F, Α ′ ), where {a mathematical formula} Α ′ is obtained from Α by flipping x.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A variable x is decreasing if and only if {a mathematical formula}score(x)>0, as its flip will decrease the cost.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The score property is also defined as {a mathematical formula}score(x)=make(x) − break(x), where make and break is the number of clauses that would become satisfied and falsified, respectively, by flipping x.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In dynamic local search algorithms, make and break measures the total weight of clauses that would become satisfied and falsified, respectively, by flipping x.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A recent local search solver called FrwCB can solve random 3-SAT instances at {a mathematical formula}r=4.2 with up to 4 million variables within reasonable time, but its performance on those with ratio 4.267 is worse than that of CCASat [30].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The Survey Propagation (SP) algorithm [7], which is extremely good at solving random 3-SAT instances, can solve random 3-SAT instances at {a mathematical formula}r=4.2 with up to 10 million variables [35], but it fails to converge on those with ratio up to 4.267, or before that [7].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To sum up, our analysis shows that promising decreasing variables are a subset of CCD variables.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This indicates if a variable is forbidden by the CC strategy, it is also forbidden by the promising decreasing strategy, but the reverse is not necessarily true.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Therefore, the forbidding strength of CC is not so strong as that of the promising decreasing strategy.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In some sense, CCD variables and promising decreasing variables may be two extremities, and there may be an intermediate notion more effective to be investigated in the future.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As we have mentioned before, the tabu method is a previous significant method for handling the cycling problem in local search, and has been widely used in local search algorithms.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In this naive implementation, the CC strategy needs {a mathematical formula}O( Δ (F)) for both storing and checking the configuration for a variable.</a>
