<a href="#0" id="0">Any search algorithm that meets in the middle — Nicholson's algorithm [47], for example, or the MM algorithm we will define in Section 4 — will expand {a mathematical formula}start, A, B and perhaps some (or all) of the {a mathematical formula}Xi in the forward direction and {a mathematical formula}C,D, and {a mathematical formula}goal in the backward direction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, B will certainly not be expanded in the backward direction.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We will now show that existing Bi-HS systems will expand B in the backward direction, and therefore do not meet in the middle according to our definition.</a>
