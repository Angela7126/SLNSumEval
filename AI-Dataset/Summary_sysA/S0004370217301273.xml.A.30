<a href="#3" id="3">Link-orientationWe say that attack relation att satisfies the property of link-orientation for K iff for all arguments {a mathematical formula}A,B,C ∈ ARK such that C is a weakening of B by {a mathematical formula}AS ⊆ ARK, it holds that if A attacks C (wrt att) and A does not attack any argument in AS (wrt att) then A attacks B (wrt att).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Context-independenceWe say attack relation assignment atts for a rule-based system {a mathematical formula}R satisfies the property of context-independence iff for any two knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K,K ′ ∈ CR and for any two arguments A, B from {a mathematical formula}ARK ∩ ARK ′ , it holds that {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ atts(K) iff (A,B) ∈ atts(K ′ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let P be a regular property different to the context-independence one.We say an attack relation assignment atts satisfies P iff for each knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ CR, {a mathematical formula}atts(K) satisfies P.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For attack relation assignments {a mathematical formula}atts,atts ′ , define {a mathematical formula}atts ⊆ atts ′ iff {a mathematical formula} ∀ K ∈ CR, {a mathematical formula}atts(K) ⊆ atts ′ (K).</a>
