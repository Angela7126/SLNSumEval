<a href="#0" id="0">The portfolio {a mathematical formula}bt is scored based on portfolio period return {a mathematical formula}st.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This procedure is repeated until the end, and the portfolio strategy is finally scored according to portfolio cumulative wealth {a mathematical formula}Sn.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The BAH strategy with uniform initial portfolio {a mathematical formula}b1=(1m, … ,1m) is referred to as uniform BAH strategy, which is usually adopted as market strategy to produce market index.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular, the portfolio strategy can be represented as {a mathematical formula}b1n={b,b, … }, in which b is a predefined portfolio.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The portfolio optimization step learns an optimal portfolio based on the set:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}U( ⋅ ) is a specified utility function.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let us assume that we are locating the price relatives that are similar to next price relative {a mathematical formula}xt+1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that each {a mathematical formula}x ˜ t+1i denotes one possible outcome, or a vector of individual price relative predictions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In all cases, we empirically set the parameters, that is, {a mathematical formula} Ε =10 and {a mathematical formula}w=5, which provide a consistent results for OLMAR in all cases.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}BK: Nonparametric kernel-based moving window strategy with {a mathematical formula}W=5, {a mathematical formula}L=10 and threshold {a mathematical formula}c=1.0, which has the best empirical performance according to Györfi et al.</a>
