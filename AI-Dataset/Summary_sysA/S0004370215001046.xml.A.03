<a href="#0" id="0">To facilitate a systematic investigation, we also propose a feature assembly method to explore the utilization of combined features for Chinese and English relation extraction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A feature assembly method is proposed that uses constraint conditions to generate combined features for capturing local dependency information.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A feature assembly method is developed to explore the utilization of combined features for Chinese and English relation extraction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, some features may be more “ atomic ” and they can be combined with other features.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, the feature {a mathematical formula}{father,son} may indicate that a “ family ” relation will occur with higher probability.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Table 6 shows the feature assembly performance when all of the candidate features were used, where {a mathematical formula}F(Seg_B) is the segmentation-based method with bin constraint.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We use the omni-word feature for Chinese relation extraction because the sub-phrases in Chinese words are also meaningful.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The utilization of feature assembly is based mainly on the fact that a relation mention has two entity mentions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By using entity mentions as “ reference objects ” to segment a relation mention, the extracted candidate features can reduce the errors caused by tagging or parsing.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this study, we proposed a feature assembly method, where utilizing six constraint conditions, the assembled features can capture the local dependency from relation instances.</a>
