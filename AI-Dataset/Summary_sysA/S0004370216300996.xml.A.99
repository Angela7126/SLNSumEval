<a href="#0" id="0">Completeness of GIC1 is obvious: searchSolutionFor is called for all values (line 3), so if a value {a mathematical formula}(x,a) is not GIC, it will necessarily be removed in line 5.In GIC2 (Algorithm 4), a value {a mathematical formula}(x,a) is let in the domain without checking if it belongs to a solution when {a mathematical formula}nbGic[x] ≥ |dom(x)| (line 4) or {a mathematical formula}stamp[x][a] ≥ time (line 5).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As time is incremented at each new call to GIC2 (line 1), {a mathematical formula}stamp[x][a] is (greater than or) equal to time only if line 3 of Algorithm 2 has been executed, which means that a solution containing {a mathematical formula}(x,a) has already been found, and thus {a mathematical formula}(x,a) is GIC.</a>
