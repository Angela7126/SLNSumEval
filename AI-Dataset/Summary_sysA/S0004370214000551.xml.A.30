<a href="#0" id="0">While {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ has all the attractive properties listed above, it also has some limitations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ runs a sequence of PTS calls, all the limitations described for PTS in Section 3.5 apply also to {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition, {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ has two further limitations:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If the heuristic is inaccurate and there are not many goals, finding even a single, unbounded solution can be hard.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As defined above, until the first solution is found, {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ runs a pure heuristic search.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ would be inefficient in domains where pure heuristic search is inefficient.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, in domains where there is a distance-to-go heuristic ({a mathematical formula}d(n)), a much more effective way to find a solution fast is to search according to {a mathematical formula}d(n) rather than {a mathematical formula}h(n)[46], [39].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Every time a better solution is found, {a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA ⁎ is required to re-sort all the nodes in OPEN (Algorithm 2) to account for the new incumbent solution (the {a mathematical formula}u( ⋅ ) values change).</a>
