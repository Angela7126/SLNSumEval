<a href="#0" id="0">In Section 4.1 we present ConstrainProblem, a procedure for modifying a classical planning problem {a mathematical formula}P=(DÂ¯,s,G) to make some of the actions inapplicable at the first step of any solution to P. Unlike removing state-action pairs, ConstrainProblem only incurs a quadratic increase in the size of the domain description per constrained action.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This requires overcoming two potential problems: (1) if the plan p generated by CP contains a cycle, then p cannot be translated into a policy because it will require two different actions at one of its states, and (2) if p goes through a state in U, then it cannot be translated into a policy that solves the nondeterministic problem {a mathematical formula}(D,{s},G), since the states in U are known to be unsolvable.</a>
