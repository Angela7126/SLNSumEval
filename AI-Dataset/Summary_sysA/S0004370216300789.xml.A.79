<a href="#0" id="0">The outcome {a mathematical formula}f( ⪰ ) is the social outcome defined by the social choice rule f. Mechanism design is concerned with the problem of constructing a mechanism — a strategic game form — which implements a social choice rule assuming a specific rational behaviour of the agents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given this observation, a lower bound of {a mathematical formula} Σ 2P=NPNP seems intuitive for weak implementation (an existential problem: guess a strategy profile with specific properties and verify it against all deviations) and a lower bound of {a mathematical formula} Π 2P=coNPNP for strong implementation (a universal problem).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That our strong implementation problem is more difficult than its weak version, {a mathematical formula} Σ 3P-complete, stems from the fact that an additional normative system has to be guessed such that all Nash equilibria satisfy a specific property.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Program statesLet {a mathematical formula}F ⊆ Π be a set of facts and Τ be a set of transitions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We now investigate the relation between the concurrent game structure {a mathematical formula}Mn that is generated by a norm-based environment program, and the concurrent game structure {a mathematical formula}M ′ that is generated by the corresponding environment program without norms (i.e., the same initial state, actions, and action specifications) which is then updated with the same norms.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A first refinement could be to identify a subset {a mathematical formula} Π M ⊆ Π of soft facts and assume that a normative system can only modify state valuations with respect to this set.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For this purpose the following consistency constraints — temporal formulae — are introduced for each {a mathematical formula}i ∈ {1, … ,n}:{a mathematical formula} It is easy to see that if {a mathematical formula}Ti is true along a path then this path — or the associated strategy of the player that controls {a mathematical formula}xi — represents a truth assignment of {a mathematical formula}xi.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Next we recall from [22] (with small modifications) the following lemma which says that Φ is satisfiable iff there is a consistent strategy of player v such that for all consistent strategies of player r — again, consistent means that truth values are assigned consistently to variables and that it is not invalid — such that eventually {a mathematical formula}winv holds.</a>
