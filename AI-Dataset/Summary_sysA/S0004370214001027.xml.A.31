<a href="#0" id="0">This section develops several new approaches for computing one MES of a CNF formula {a mathematical formula}F. The first solution consists of adapting any MUS extraction algorithm based on identification of so-called transition clauses, for MES extraction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Afterwards, key techniques used in MUS extraction are studied.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Model rotation [23], [24] is applied to MES extraction, and it is argued that clause set refinement [21], [22], [23] cannot be directly applied to MES extraction algorithms resulting from adapting existing MUS extraction algorithms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Next, a reduction from MES to group-MUS formulation [25], [22] is developed, which enables the use of both model rotation and clause set refinement.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Although the reduction of MES to group-MUS extraction enables the integration of key techniques, it is also the case that the resulting instances of SAT are hard to solve.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A key definition in MUS extraction algorithms is that of transition clause[4].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A transition clause c is such that, if added to a satisfiable subformula {a mathematical formula}R, the resulting subformula is unsatisfiable.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This definition can be generalized for MES extraction as follows.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let {a mathematical formula}R ⊊ F denote a (reference) subformula of {a mathematical formula}F which is to be extended to be equivalent to {a mathematical formula}F. Observe that {a mathematical formula}F ⊨ R, and so, in case {a mathematical formula}R ⊨ ; ̸ F, our goal is to extend {a mathematical formula}R with a clause {a mathematical formula}c ∈ F ∖ R, such that {a mathematical formula}R ∪ {c} ⊨ F, and so {a mathematical formula}R ∪ {c} ≡ F.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We will refer to such clauses c as witnesses of equivalence of the formulas {a mathematical formula}R ∪ {c} and {a mathematical formula}F, since they are required for the certification of the equivalence of the two formulas.</a>
