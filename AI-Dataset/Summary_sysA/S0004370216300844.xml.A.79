<a href="#0" id="0">We create a citation graph D, a compatibility graph G, and a set of articles W, such that the instance {a mathematical formula}(D,G,W,h:= ℓ ,k:= ℓ − 1) of Cautious H-Index Manipulation and the instance {a mathematical formula}(D,G,W) of H-Index Improvement are yes-instances if and only if {a mathematical formula}(H, ℓ ) is a yes-instance for Multicolored Clique.Our Cautious H-Index Manipulation and H-Index Improvement instances have an article set {a mathematical formula}W=W ≥ ⊎ W<, where {a mathematical formula}W<:=V(H) and {a mathematical formula}W ≥ consists of {a mathematical formula} ℓ − 1 new articles.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Assume first that {a mathematical formula}(H, ℓ ) is a yes-instance and let S be an independent set of size ℓ in H. Then, merging all articles of S into one article in the Cautious H-Index Manipulation instance is valid since the compatibility graph G is a clique.</a>
