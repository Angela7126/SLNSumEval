<a href="#0" id="0">More generally, note that we can always partition the set of variables V in two sets {a mathematical formula}V ′ and {a mathematical formula}V ∖ V ′ such that {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ V ′ is a network over {a mathematical formula}{EC,TPP,TPP − 1}, {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ (V ∖ V ′ ) is a network over {a mathematical formula}{TPP,TPP − 1,NTPP,NTPP − 1} and {a mathematical formula}viPPvj for any {a mathematical formula}vi ∈ V ′ and {a mathematical formula}vj ∈ V ∖ V ′ (see the following proof of Proposition 10).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is then straightforward to find a convex solution of {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ V ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As we show in the proof of Proposition 10, this solution of {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ V ′ can always be extended to a solution of Θ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">There exists a consistent atomic RCC8 network over{a mathematical formula}{EC,DC}which has no convex solution in{a mathematical formula}R2.Consider the consistent atomic RCC8 network Θ containing the following constraints:{a mathematical formula} as well as the constraint xDCy for every pair of variables {a mathematical formula}(x,y) from {a mathematical formula}{a,b,c,u,v,w} which does not appear in the list above.Assuming that a convex solution {a mathematical formula}S of Θ in the plane exists, we can draw {a mathematical formula}K3,3 as follows.</a>
