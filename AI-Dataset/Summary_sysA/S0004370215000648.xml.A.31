<a href="#1" id="1">In order to encode the set of constraints {a mathematical formula}{ Φ k} that underlie both the learning and the inference problems, it is convenient to first introduce a background knowledge of predicates expressing facts about the relative positioning of blocks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To this end we add a fresh predicate {a mathematical formula}left(i,j), that encodes the fact that “ a generic block of index i touches a second block j from the left ” , defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} Similarly, we add analogous predicates for the other directions: {a mathematical formula}right(i,j), {a mathematical formula}below(i,j), {a mathematical formula}over(i,j) (see Fig.</a>
