<a href="#0" id="0">From the set of observations streams generated by the input exploratory options, Curious Dr. MISFA learns a slow feature abstraction (say {a mathematical formula} Φ i) corresponding to the estimated easiest-yet-unlearned exploratory option stream (say {a mathematical formula}xj).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The abstraction's output stream {a mathematical formula}yi= Φ i(xj) has a zero-mean and unit-variance over time [46], and is a lower-dimensional representation of the input {a mathematical formula}xj (satisfies Constraint (1); see Section 4.1.2).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The output values {a mathematical formula}yi(t) are discretized to a set of abstraction states {a mathematical formula}S Φ i Φ , which represent the newly discovered abstracted states of the agent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Each target option learned is added to the target-option set {a mathematical formula}OL and the learning process iterates until all the learnable exploratory option streams are encoded.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since the expected behavior of Curious Dr. MISFA ensures that the Constraints (1), (2), (3) are satisfied [47] and the learned target-option's policy satisfies Constraint (4), the target-option set {a mathematical formula}OL, at any time t, therefore satisfies the required constraints.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To make the skill acquisition open-ended and to acquire more complex skills (see Section 4.2), the learned target option {a mathematical formula}OL can be used to explore the newly discovered abstracted-state space (see Section 5.3).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, a target option may not be reused straight-away, since by definition, it differs from an exploratory option, wherein the target-option's policy is deterministic, while the exploratory-option's policy is stochastic (see Section 5.1).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The iCub starts the experiment without any learned modules, so the exploratory-option's policy {a mathematical formula} Π 1e is a random-walk over the abstracted state space {a mathematical formula}S Φ (see Section 5.4).</a>
