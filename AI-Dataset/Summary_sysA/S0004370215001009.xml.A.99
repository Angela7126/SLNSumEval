<a href="#0" id="0">In the case of a finite number of random variables with finite ranges, one can uniquely define a joint probability distribution P by assigning a probability number to each joint assignment of values {a mathematical formula}vi ∈ Rangei,i=1, … ,n, to random variables {a mathematical formula}P(V1=v1, … ,Vn=vn).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to define this semantics for arbitrary constraints, we extend the sample space by considering all atoms appearing in the logical theory L. We assume there is a countable number of atoms, treat them as random variables taking values true or false and denote the set of all those atoms with A.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As for variables in V we fix the enumeration and define the sample space {a mathematical formula} Ω L being the Cartesian product of the values of all atoms:{a mathematical formula} For the event space of the logic part of the theory {a mathematical formula}AL, we can take the sample space's powerset, since the sample space is countable:{a mathematical formula} The sample space for the entire theory {a mathematical formula} Ω T is the Cartesian product of the sample spaces for the random variables and the logical theory:{a mathematical formula} The event space of the entire theory {a mathematical formula}AT is built as well from the event spaces of the random variables and logical theory.</a>
