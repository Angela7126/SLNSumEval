<a href="#0" id="0">To induce a qualitative model with respect to a certain attribute {a mathematical formula}Ai, we first compute the PDQ PD for the entire learning set: for each example, we compute the set of dependent values {a mathematical formula}D and find the total ordering of attribute values {a mathematical formula}Ai as explained in the previous two sections.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We replace the original class labels with partial derivatives (that is, the total ordering) and induce a model for predicting the ordering.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We used Qube to calculate {a mathematical formula}@survived=1@treatment for each learning example in the original data set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For each set of parameters (N, #atts, Μ ) we sampled ten data sets, computed the PDQ PDs {a mathematical formula}@f=1@Ai, for {a mathematical formula}i ∈ {1,2,3}, and induced the qualitative models using the C4.5 algorithm.</a>
