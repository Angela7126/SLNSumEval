<a href="#0" id="0">Unlike our approach, the existing work on truckload (and other similar domains) employ pure network flow formulations (i.e., only assigning demand from the same zone as supply) for both current and future time steps, or only for the future time step [10].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is the reason for better approximations provided by our formulation, as shown in the non-trivial improvements in results (on an average 9%) provided by our approach over Hybrid Multi-Stage Stochastic optimization (HSS) [10] on three different taxi data sets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Case 1 is similar to the Markov property defined in the context of resource allocation problem{sup:4} and makes the problem polynomial time solvable as the formulation is equivalent to a minimum cost network flow problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Formally stating the above discussion, for the special case when {a mathematical formula} Δ ijt,t ′ = Δ i ′ jt,t ′ , ∀ j,t,t ′ ,i,i ′ (i.e., a request completion decision epoch is same irrespective of the server assigned to it), we show the reduction of the OSTM to a min cost flow problem with integer capacities (Proposition 1).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As the min cost flow problem is polynomial time solvable, the OSTM is also polynomial time solvable for this special case.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">But in practice depending on the value of Τ , f and g function will restrict the number of variables.</a>
