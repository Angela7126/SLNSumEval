<a href="#0" id="0">We prove the surprising result that {a mathematical formula}127645, the length of the longest completely multiplicative sequence of discrepancy 3, is also the maximal length of a multiplicative sequence of discrepancy 3, which is not the case for {a mathematical formula}C=1 and {a mathematical formula}C=2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Notice that {a mathematical formula}| ∑ i=1jxi| from the definition of C-boundedness above can be characterised as the absolute value of the difference of the number of occurrences of +1 in {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xj and the number of occurrences of − 1 in {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xj.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Under our correspondence, the number of occurrences of +1 in {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xj is the number of occurrences of 1 in {a mathematical formula}a1, … ,aj is {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1jai.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It suffices to notice that {a mathematical formula}| ∑ i=1jai| is odd if, and only if, j is odd.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, under the conditions of the proposition, {a mathematical formula}| ∑ i=1jai| ≤ C − 1, and the sequence can be extended arbitrarily.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The general question of the existence of a finite bound on the length of ±1 sequences of discrepancy 3 (that is, the Erd Ő s conjecture for {a mathematical formula}C=3) remains open.</a>
