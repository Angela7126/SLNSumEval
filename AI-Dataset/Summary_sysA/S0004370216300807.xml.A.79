<a href="#0" id="0">The k-map of Γ is the good map generated by the set of distinguished nodes {a mathematical formula}{v ∈ V Γ :f(v) ≥ k}, where {a mathematical formula}f:V Γ → R is a selective function measuring a specific property of the nodes in Γ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A graph region Γ captures the specification given via a navigational expression e starting from a single node of the graph where {a mathematical formula} Γ .E Γ and {a mathematical formula} Γ .V Γ are edges and nodes navigated during the evaluation of e. The need to start from a node (or a set of nodes) is motivated by the fact that our framework is meant to be used on the Web, and thus, it is infeasible to start the evaluation of a navigational expression from all nodes of the Web graph (assuming one can enumerate all of them).</a>
