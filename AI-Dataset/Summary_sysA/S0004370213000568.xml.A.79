<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we will adopt the definition of logics given by Tarski, under which a logic is a pair {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}L is the set of expressions (propositions) of the underlying language and {a mathematical formula}Cn:2L ↦ 2L is a function mapping sets of propositions to sets of propositions (consequence operator).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Furthermore, closure under connectives is a syntactic requirement, so, e.g., ¬a is a unique proposition, and no assumptions are made as to its semantics; on the other hand, complementarity is semantic, so the complement of A as defined above has a specific semantics, and there could be several complements of a single belief (or even none at all).Supra-classicality:A logic {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 that is closed under the standard logical connectives ({a mathematical formula} ∧ , ∨ , → ,¬) is supra-classical iff for all A, {a mathematical formula}Cn(A) contains all classical consequences of A[3].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For Boolean logics, partial meet contraction is not necessarily equivalent with neither the AGM postulates, nor the AGM-relevance postulates.Let {a mathematical formula}R be the set of real numbers, and {a mathematical formula}Q the set of rational numbers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">There are logics that are relevance-compliant and AGM-compliant such that relevance does not imply recovery, and recovery does not imply relevance.Consider the following logic:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}The logic is obviously Tarskian and finite, thus compact, so it is also relevance-compliant by Theorem 4.8.It can also be shown to be AGM-compliant.</a>
