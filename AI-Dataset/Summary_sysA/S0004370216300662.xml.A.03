<a href="#5" id="5">From this we construct a repair ABox {a mathematical formula}A ′ as follows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let us consider various possibilities for an interpretation I of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}( ⇐ ) Let {a mathematical formula}I ∈ RASflp( Π ) be some flp-repair answer set of Π with a repair ABox {a mathematical formula}A ′ , i.e.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}¬Xk(b)) is in {a mathematical formula}A ′ .</a>

<a href="#10" id="10">there exists an ABox {a mathematical formula}A ′ such that I is a weak answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T,A ′ ,P 〉 .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">(Membership) We can guess a repair {a mathematical formula}A ′ and then check whether I is an flp-repair answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 O ′ ,P 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}O ′ = 〈 T,A ′ 〉 .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Note that every answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ resp.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence, {a mathematical formula}I ′ does not exist and I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Thus from Proposition 61, it follows that {a mathematical formula}I ˆ is a compatible set for {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T ∪ A ′ ,P 〉 ; hence {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Hence I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ , and thus a deletion repair answer set of Π .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">That is, for some {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊆ A, we have that I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T ∪ A ′ ,P 〉 .</a>
