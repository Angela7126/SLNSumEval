<a href="#0" id="0">The basic idea is simply to use the formula {a mathematical formula} Δ ⪰ Φ (M) associated to a model {a mathematical formula}M to obtain models that are not less preferred than {a mathematical formula}M. This algorithm takes as input a CNF formula Φ , a preference relation ⪰ , a strictly positive integer k, and a set X of propositional variables allowing to define the equivalence relation {a mathematical formula} ≈ X.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It consists in computing a Top-k solution for an instance {a mathematical formula}T=( Φ h, ⪰ Φ s,Var( Φ h ∧ Φ s),k) where {a mathematical formula} Φ h ∧ Φ s is a Partial MAX-SAT instance ({a mathematical formula} Φ h and {a mathematical formula} Φ s are the hard part and the soft part respectively) and {a mathematical formula} ⪰ Φ s is the preference relation defined in Section 3.1.</a>
