<a href="#0" id="0">In the following, {a mathematical formula}T and {a mathematical formula}S respectively refer to the set of tasks and shifts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We refer to this model as MIP model:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that a maximum independent set in {a mathematical formula}GI, is not necessarily maximal in {a mathematical formula}GCI.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, using {a mathematical formula}GCI is presumably better than using {a mathematical formula}GI to filter AtMostNValue when difference constraints figure in the model (Proposition 2).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Because of difference constraints, {a mathematical formula}GCI is sparser than {a mathematical formula}GI (Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the following we respectively note {a mathematical formula}z ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}z ̲ r the optimal objective and the objective lower bound at root node.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As justified in Section 3.5, {a mathematical formula}R4 calls the AllDifferent BC filtering algorithm on every independent set.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This means {a mathematical formula}R4 is unfortunately not able to get back the good tradeoff between filtering and runtime of the original model, which has AllDifferent constraints in it.</a>
