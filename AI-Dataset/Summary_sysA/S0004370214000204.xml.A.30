<a href="#1" id="1">– Minimal Model Finding Problem: Given a CNF theory Π , compute a minimal model {a mathematical formula}M for Π .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Steady setGiven a CNF theory Π and a model {a mathematical formula}M for Π , the minimal model {a mathematical formula}St ⊆ M of the theory {a mathematical formula} Π M ← nd is called the steady set of {a mathematical formula}M for Π .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a positive CNF theory Π and an eliminating operator Ξ , then{a mathematical formula}GEA Ξ ( Π ,atom( Π ))outputs a minimal model of Π .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is a HEF CNF theory since no superset of {a mathematical formula}{g,j} and no superset of {a mathematical formula}{f,h} is an elementary set for Π .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As for the first, we observe that, for any CNF theory Π and model {a mathematical formula}M of Π , {a mathematical formula} Σ M( Π ) is positive.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let Π be a non-disjunctive CNF theory.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Each minimal non-outbound set in{a mathematical formula}atom( Π )for Π is super-elementary for Π .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">given a HEF CNF theory Π and a model {a mathematical formula}M for Π , a super-elementary set for {a mathematical formula} Σ M( Π ) is erasable in {a mathematical formula}M for Π (Theorem 5.1 in Section 5.4),</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Given a positive HEF CNF theory Π and a set of atoms{a mathematical formula}N ⊆ atom( Π ), checking if{a mathematical formula}Nis a minimal model of Π can be accomplished in polynomial time.The proof follows immediately from Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 5.5.</a>
