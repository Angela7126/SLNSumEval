<a href="#0" id="0">To complete the proof for Case (b), we show how, with a minor modification of the previous construction, we can further restrict p to be a fact.It is important to note that {a mathematical formula}D and p we will construct are such that {a mathematical formula}D ⊨ p.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this case the notions of compliance and strong compliance coincide, and therefore the reductions show {an inline-figure}-hardness of {an inline-figure} as well.We start with the definition of the source schema: let it consist of unary relational names {a mathematical formula}Zero, {a mathematical formula}One and {a mathematical formula}Tiledt for each {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T, as well as binary relational names {a mathematical formula}HBiti and {a mathematical formula}VBiti for each i such that {a mathematical formula}n ≥ i ≥ 1.Then, let source instance {a mathematical formula}D consist of the following facts over constants 0, 1, and e:{a mathematical formula}Let now the target schema consists of relational names {a mathematical formula}HValidi and {a mathematical formula}VValidi, with {a mathematical formula}n ≥ i ≥ 1, all with arity 3n.We next construct {a mathematical formula}M. For the sake of readability, we allow for (safe) equalities of variables in the bodies of mappings, which clearly does not add any power to the language and can be eliminated by a polynomial transformation.</a>
