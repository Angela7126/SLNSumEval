<a href="#4" id="4">Factored SSP MDP-IPFormally a Factored SSP MDP-IP is defined by {a mathematical formula} 〈 X → ,A,C,K,G,x → 0 〉 where A is defined as for any SSP MDP-IP, {a mathematical formula}X → is a vector of n state variables {a mathematical formula}(X1, … ,Xn), C is a factored cost function, {a mathematical formula}K is a set of factored transition credal sets (Definition 4.2), G is a set of goal states and {a mathematical formula}x → 0 the initial state.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For enumerated SSP MDP-IPs we assume state and action pair independence (Assumption 3.2).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the case of factored SSP MDP-IP, instead of assuming independence for single states we now assume independence for abstract states, i.e., a set of states that are defined by the partial assignment of {a mathematical formula}paa(Xi ′ ).</a>
