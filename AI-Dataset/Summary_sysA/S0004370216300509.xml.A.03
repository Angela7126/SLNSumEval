<a href="#0" id="0">For a fair comparison, one needs to look at the performance of smooth sparse coding (or standard sparse coding) when it uses lasso updates and marginal regression updates.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We consider the following smooth version of the sparse coding problem:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} ∑ j=1nw(xj,xi)=1 for all i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Alternatively, {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) may be expressed by domain experts, learned from data before the sparse coding training, or learned jointly with the dictionary and codes during the sparse coding training.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We compare the proposed smooth sparse coding algorithm, standard sparse coding with lasso [17] and marginal regression updates respectively, with a relative reconstruction error {a mathematical formula} ‖ X − D ˆ B ˆ ‖ F/ ‖ X ‖ F convergence criterion.</a>
