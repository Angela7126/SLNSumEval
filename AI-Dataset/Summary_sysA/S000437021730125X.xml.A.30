<a href="#0" id="0">We will see later that our algorithm satisfies the constraint given by (2) for each task t with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ), where Μ is the confidence parameter with which constraint is satisfied.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}S ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}St denote the optimal set and set selected at time t respectively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then the regret of an algorithm {a mathematical formula}A if the constraint is satisfied is given as:{a mathematical formula} Since the constraint is satisfied with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ):{a mathematical formula} where L is the cost that is incurred by the requester if the constraint fails to satisfy.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We consider a setting with large value of L, and the requester would not want to violate the constraint.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, due to stochasticity involved in learning the qualities, there is a small probability ( Μ ) with which the constraint can be violated.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">With {a mathematical formula} Μ =1/T, we get:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The CCB-NS algorithm satisfies the accuracy constraint with probability at least{a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ )at every round t.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The proposed algorithm is adaptive exploration separated and the number of suboptimal rounds for CCB-S is bounded by {a mathematical formula}2(h − 1( Δ ))2ln ⁡ (2n Μ ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In Lemma 5.2, we prove that after {a mathematical formula}l=2(h − 1( Δ ))2ln ⁡ (2n Μ ) steps, there is no set S which satisfies the constraint with respect to upper confidence bound and its cost is less then the optimal cost.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Moreover, after {a mathematical formula}l=2(h − 1( Δ ))2ln ⁡ (2n Μ ) steps, we have {a mathematical formula}fS ⁎ (q ˆ − )< Α with probability {a mathematical formula}1 − Μ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The number of non-optimal rounds of the CCB-S algorithm is bounded by{a mathematical formula}2(h − 1( Δ ))2ln ⁡ (2n Μ )with probability{a mathematical formula}1 − Μ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">From Lemma 5.2, the number of exploration rounds is bounded by {a mathematical formula}2(h − 1( Δ ))2ln ⁡ (2n Μ ) with probability {a mathematical formula}1 − Μ .</a>
