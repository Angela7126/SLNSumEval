<a href="#0" id="0">Section 5 details the overlapping layered learning approach of the 2014 UT Austin Villa team and in Section 6 we provide detailed analysis of its performance.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The 2014 UT Austin Villa team introduced an extensive layered learning approach to learn skills for the robot such as getting up, walking, and kicking.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This approach includes sequential layered learning where a newly learned layer is frozen before learning of subsequent layers, as well as overlapping layers where parts of previously learned layers are re-optimized as part of the current layer being learned.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The above overlapping layered approach of first independently learning the walk approach and kick, and then learning the two position parameters, does better than both the sequential layered learning approach where all kick parameters are learned after freezing the approach, and the concurrent layered learning approach where both approach and kick parameters are learned simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To isolate the performance of kicking learned through an overlapping layered learning approach we disable all kicking (except for on kickoffs where we once again have a robot kick the ball as far as possible toward the opponent's goal without scoring) and used an “ always dribble ” behavior.</a>
