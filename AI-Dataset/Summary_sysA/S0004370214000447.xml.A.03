<a href="#0" id="0">A solution to an HTN planning problem {a mathematical formula}(s0,T,M,A) is a list of decomposition trees[67], [20].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Decomposition constraints and task constraints enhance the learned HTN models using statistical information from the partial decomposition trees</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have thus built the set of all the method constraints MC for creating a set of methods {a mathematical formula}M based on the given plan traces.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These constraints ensure that the learned HTN models are consistent with the given partial decomposition trees.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For the HTNLearn algorithm, we will evaluate the learned HTN methods and the learned action models separately.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this setting, our learning problem is reduced to learning action models and method preconditions simultaneously, with no need to learn method structures (since method structures can be directly extracted from decomposition trees), as is done by our previous work [70].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To determine the importance of learning the action models and method preconditions simultaneously, we ran an experiment comparing HTNLearn against a hybrid system, that we call it {a mathematical formula}ARMS+, which first uses ARMS to learn the action models and then uses the method-based constraints to learn the method preconditions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In other words, action models are helpful for learning HTN structure.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this paper, we presented a novel algorithm, HTNLearn, to learn the action models and method preconditions of an HTN model.</a>
