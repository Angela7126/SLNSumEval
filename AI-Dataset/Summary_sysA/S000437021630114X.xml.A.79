<a href="#0" id="0">Thus, a partial state p can be defined as a set of facts and is associated with the set of states that satisfy the partial assignment, {a mathematical formula}{s|p[v]=s[v] ∀ v ∈ Vp}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We denote as {a mathematical formula}p|V ′ the projection of p to the set of variables {a mathematical formula}V ′ ⊆ Vp, i.e., as the partial assignment over {a mathematical formula}V ′ having the same value as p for variables it is defined for.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The algorithm may stop when the sum of the minimum g values of generated states for the forward and backward searches is at least {a mathematical formula}wtotal, the cost of the cheapest solution path found so far.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The image operation of a set of states with respect to a given transition relation can be decomposed into basic logical operations over BDDs: {a mathematical formula}image(S,T):=( ∃ x(S ∧ T))[x ′ /x].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}CT has several advantages over the baseline approach: first, if S does not contain any state matching the conditions of a branch of the tree, all the operators regarding that branch are ignored, which reduces the number of individual image operations that are needed.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This reflects the relevance of our enhancements, unifying operators based on the balanced disjunction tree up to a maximum memory limit of 100 000 nodes ({a mathematical formula}UT100kDT) for image computation and e-deletion for state-invariant pruning, to make symbolic search a state-of-the-art technique for cost-optimal planning.</a>
