<a href="#0" id="0">We think of the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n as the binary conjunction space, and of {a mathematical formula}x → Α as the prototype of the conjunctive concept Α .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We also allow some deviation from the prototype by taking into account the different levels of importance of each label {a mathematical formula}Li.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The differing importance of the labels is characterised by a weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → which weights each dimension in the binary space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These ideas are illustrated in Fig.</a>
