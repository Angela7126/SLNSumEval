<a href="#0" id="0">This can be explained by observing that the cutting-plane algorithm does not actually require the separation oracle to be perfect: as long as the approximation is consistent with the hard rules (which is necessarily the case even in sub-optimal solutions), the constraint added to the working set {a mathematical formula}W at each iteration still restricts the quadratic program in a sound manner (see Algorithm 1).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Some attempts to extend SMT solvers to quantified formulae [48], [49], [50] and to non-linear arithmetic [67], [68], [69] have been presented in the literature; although the state of the art of these extensions is not yet satisfactory in terms of efficiency, since they can currently handle problems which are much smaller — in terms of size, number of variables and of arithmetical operations — than the quantifier-free problems with linear constraints at the reach of current SMT solvers, these techniques are evolving rapidly and promise rapid improvements in terms of performances in the next few years; hence, we can rather easily extend our framework in these directions as soon as the underlying SMT technology is mature enough.</a>
