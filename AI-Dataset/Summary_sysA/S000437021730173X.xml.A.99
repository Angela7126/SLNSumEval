<a href="#0" id="0">We next examine possible blow-ups; then we show that our method is exponentially separated from all previous search reduction techniques; then we show how to design (augmented-optimal) search algorithms for {a mathematical formula} Θ Π F.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we pointed out, the decoupled state space is, in general, infinite due to (1) different center paths, and due to (2) different pricing functions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Specifically, here and in the discussions below, by an exponential separation from X, where X is an alternate search reduction method, we mean a family {a mathematical formula}{ Π n|n ∈ N+} of planning tasks, of size (number of state variables and actions) polynomially related to n, so that (i) the number of reachable decoupled states is bounded by a polynomial in n, while (ii) the state space size under X is exponential in n. In most cases, the exponential separation will be our Scaling example, fixing, for simplicity, the number of locations to be the same as the number n of objects {a mathematical formula}oi to transport.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">State space search here is guided by a heuristic function, heuristic for short, a function h that maps states s to estimates of remaining cost, i.e., of the cost of an optimal solution for s. We denote that latter cost as the perfect heuristic{a mathematical formula}h ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Observe that, once {a mathematical formula}a0C has been applied, the hypercube s of reached leaf states over the variables {a mathematical formula}pi corresponds exactly to the space of all assignments over {a mathematical formula}Pi.Consider the time point in search where search has explored each of the alternatives {a mathematical formula}a1C, … ,amC (applied each of these actions to the initial state separately), and now explores the alternative {a mathematical formula}a0C.</a>
