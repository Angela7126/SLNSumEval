<a href="#4" id="4">Find-Acceptable-Plan's parameters consist of a nondeterministic planning domain D, its determinization {a mathematical formula}D¯, an initial state {a mathematical formula}s0, a set of goal states G, a classical planner CP, and a set U of states to avoid.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">More formally, a plan p is U-acceptable in a state s with respect to a nondeterministic domain D, its determinization {a mathematical formula}D¯, a classical planning problem {a mathematical formula}(D¯,s,G) and a set of states U if:</a>
