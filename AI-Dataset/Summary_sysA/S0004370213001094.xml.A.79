<a href="#0" id="0">We now show that {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}ac( Π ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By the definition, {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}ac( Π ) if {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of{a mathematical formula} By Proposition 11, {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of (15) iff X is an answer set of{a mathematical formula} The transformation described in Observation 1 applied to (16) will result in {a mathematical formula} Π A.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We are given that X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π A.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consequently, it is an answer set of (16).Right-to-left: Let M be a functional set of ground atoms of Σ and X be a set of ground atoms such that {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}ac( Π ).</a>
