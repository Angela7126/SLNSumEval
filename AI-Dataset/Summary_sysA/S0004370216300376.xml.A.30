<a href="#0" id="0">We set up four different showcases for the QBF Gallery 2013.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The four showcases are (1) solving, (2) preprocessing, (3) applications, and (4) certification.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition to the application of preprocessing prior to solving, the actual selection of benchmarks might have an influence on the performance of solvers and hence on the rankings in terms of solved instances.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A ranking of solvers obtained by experiments might be skewed if certain families of instances are overrepresented in the benchmark set that underlies the experimental evaluation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to analyze the effect of the benchmark selection on the ranking of solvers, we carried out the following sampling experiment.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">According to the results shown in Table 12, the largest number of instances in the eval2012r2 were solved with the sequence ABCD.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Based on this observation, we ran the sequence ABCD on the other benchmark sets for at most six rounds.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Table 13 shows the results of these experiments.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Except for the set qbf-hardness, incremental preprocessing solves considerably more instances than the individual preprocessors (Table 11).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For example, for the sets planning-CTE and conformant-planning, 57% and 23% more instances are solved, respectively.</a>
