<a href="#0" id="0">A WPMS algorithm for the WPMS problem, takes as input a WPMS formula Φ and returns an assignment {a mathematical formula}I, such that, {a mathematical formula}I( Φ ) ≥ cost( Φ ).Given unlimited resources of time and memory, we say that a WPMS algorithm is complete or exact if for any input WPMS formula Φ and returned {a mathematical formula}I, {a mathematical formula}I( Φ )=cost( Φ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This clustering methodology assumes a good cluster to be Gaussian distributed, and iteratively splits clusters in two until they all pass the Anderson – Darling statistic, a statistical test for “ Gaussianness. ” Robust parameter sets are obtained by not allowing clusters to contain fewer than a manually chosen threshold, a value which depends on the size of the dataset.</a>
