<a href="#0" id="0">Throughout Appendix A, we fix a normalized {a mathematical formula}ALCI ontology {a mathematical formula}O, an admissible context structure {a mathematical formula}D= 〈 V,E,core, ≺ 〉 , and a clause system {a mathematical formula}S for {a mathematical formula}D such that no inference rule from Table 3 is applicable to {a mathematical formula}S; furthermore, we fix L to be the set of all literals that occur in {a mathematical formula}O, {a mathematical formula}D, or {a mathematical formula}S. We prove Theorem 6 by showing the following contrapositive claim: {a mathematical formula}O ⊭ K ⊑ M holds for each query {a mathematical formula}K ⊑ M for which a context {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V exists such that</a>

<a href="#2" id="2">In the rest of Appendix B, we fix a normalized {a mathematical formula}ALCI ontology {a mathematical formula}O, an admissible decomposition {a mathematical formula}D= 〈 V,E,core,knw,poss, ≺ , Θ 〉 of {a mathematical formula}O and an arbitrary finite set of queries, and a clause system {a mathematical formula}S for {a mathematical formula}D satisfying the preconditions of Theorem 37; furthermore, we fix L to be the set of all literals that occur in {a mathematical formula}O, {a mathematical formula}D, or {a mathematical formula}S. We prove Theorem 37 by constructing a pre-interpretation that satisfies {a mathematical formula}O but refutes the relevant queries.</a>
