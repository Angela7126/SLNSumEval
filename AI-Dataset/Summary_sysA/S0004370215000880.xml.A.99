<a href="#0" id="0">An optimal proportional assignment can be computed in polynomial time even if agents are allowed to express indifference between objects.If there exists no assignment in which each agent gets one of his most preferred objects, then {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ is infinite.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This means the first proportionality constraint of agents cannot be simultaneously satisfied for a finite {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In that case any arbitrary assignment satisfies optimality proportionality with {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ = ∞ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In case there exists an assignment in which each agent gets one of his most preferred objects, then {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ is finite.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show how to compute such an {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ as well as the assignment corresponding to it.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">An assignment p satisfies {a mathematical formula}1/ Α proportionality if for each {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N and each {a mathematical formula}k ∈ {1, … ,ki},{a mathematical formula} Since {a mathematical formula}ki ≤ m, there are in total mn such constraints.</a>
