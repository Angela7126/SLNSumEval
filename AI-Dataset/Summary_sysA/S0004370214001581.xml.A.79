<a href="#0" id="0">Focusing on the structure of {a mathematical formula}CG Π B, let {a mathematical formula}RB-PlanExist(G) and {a mathematical formula}RB-PlanGen(G) be respectively the plan existence and plan generation problems restricted to {a mathematical formula}RB planning tasks whose black causal graphs are elements of{a mathematical formula}G. Note that these problems put no restriction on the structure of the causal graph itself beyond being a super-graph of some element of {a mathematical formula}G. Theorem 5 below refines the complexity characterization for {a mathematical formula}RB with respect to the structure of the black causal graph, providing a valuable fragment of tractability via Theorem 1, and establishing {a mathematical formula}P/NPdichotomies for both general {a mathematical formula}RB, as well as for {a mathematical formula}RB restricted to fixed-size domain variables.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this special case, the planning tasks solved inside {a mathematical formula}Achieve(g) are trivial: All black variables v are completely independent, and it suffices to find a DTG path from v's current value to {a mathematical formula}g[v] (if defined) for each v individually.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The main choice points are (i) selecting actions {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A0 in the while loop (pertains to red facts following), and (ii) selecting DTG paths for black variables in the solution to {a mathematical formula} Π B, i.e., inside {a mathematical formula}Achieve(g) (pertains to both, red facts following and relaxed plan repair).</a>
