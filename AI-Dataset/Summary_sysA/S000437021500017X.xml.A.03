<a href="#0" id="0">A target option {a mathematical formula}OL ∈ OL contains a learned abstraction {a mathematical formula} Φ i and a learned deterministic policy {a mathematical formula} Π iL.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, continual curiosity-driven skill acquisition learning problem is a slightly modified version of the above formulation, such that the target options learned form a basis for new input exploratory options:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}F(.)</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From the set of observations streams generated by the input exploratory options, Curious Dr. MISFA learns a slow feature abstraction (say {a mathematical formula} Φ i) corresponding to the estimated easiest-yet-unlearned exploratory option stream (say {a mathematical formula}xj).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Each target option learned is added to the target-option set {a mathematical formula}OL and the learning process iterates until all the learnable exploratory option streams are encoded.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We construct two new exploratory options instead, which are based on the target option {a mathematical formula}OiL that was learned last (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula} Π int: An internal policy that is learned (see Section 5.2) to determine for which exploratory option {a mathematical formula}Oe to encode a slow feature abstraction.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula} Π L: Target-option's deterministic policy that is learned (see Section 5.3) to maximize variation in the slow feature abstraction output.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The iCub starts the experiment without any learned modules, so the exploratory-option's policy {a mathematical formula} Π 1e is a random-walk over the abstracted state space {a mathematical formula}S Φ (see Section 5.4).</a>
