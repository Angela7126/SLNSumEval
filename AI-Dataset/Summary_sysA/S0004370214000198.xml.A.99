<a href="#0" id="0">This corresponds to solving the partial planning problem {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ , which has implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}V¯i+1 ′ since variables in {a mathematical formula}{ai+1,bi+1,xi+1} have to be false for {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ to be solvable due to Lemma 2 and, if {a mathematical formula}i+1<n, we recursively have to satisfy the implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}V¯i+2 ′ of {a mathematical formula}Pi+2 ′ to apply the action pair {a mathematical formula}(u(i+1)01,u(i+1)11) while {a mathematical formula}bi+1 is false.Let {a mathematical formula} Ω i+1 be a plan solving {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Just as before we define two partial planning instances {a mathematical formula}Pi1 ″ (pi) and {a mathematical formula}Pi2 ″ (pi) for each {a mathematical formula}1 ⩽ i ⩽ n and each assignment {a mathematical formula}pi.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The goal of {a mathematical formula}Pi1 ″ (pi) is {a mathematical formula}ui9, while the goal of {a mathematical formula}Pi2 ″ (pi) is {a mathematical formula}vi9.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In spite of the differences between {a mathematical formula}PF and {a mathematical formula}PF ′ , the mechanism is the same: for each {a mathematical formula}1 ⩽ i ⩽ n, the planning instance {a mathematical formula}Pi1 ″ (pi) has associated modified loop instance {a mathematical formula}Ui1={ai,bi,xi,ui3,ui4,ui5,ui6}, while {a mathematical formula}Pi2 ″ (pi) has alternative modified loop instances {a mathematical formula}Ui1 and {a mathematical formula}Ui2={ai,bi,xi,vi3,vi4,vi5,vi6}.</a>
