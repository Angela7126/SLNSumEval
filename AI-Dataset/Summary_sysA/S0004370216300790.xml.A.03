<a href="#0" id="0">Human – Robot Interaction (HRI) represents a challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">a belief state that includes a priori common-sense knowledge and mental models of each of the agents involved (the robot and its human partners).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The robot updates accordingly the two knowledge models it maintains: the robot model is updated with the fact 〈 BOOK isVisible true 〉 , while the human model is updated with 〈 BOOK isVisible false 〉 .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As another example, when the human says “ this ” , the robot checks if the human is currently pointing at an object.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This represents the procedural knowledge of the robot as well as its knowledge about the actions that the human partner is able to achieve.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It enables the robot as well as the human to communicate their beliefs about the task to be achieved, in order to share mutual knowledge and to synchronise their activities.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This study focuses on multi-modal, interactive grounding only: the robot observes, builds and maintains knowledge about its human partners perspectives and affordances but does not actually perform any physical action besides verbal interaction and simple head movements.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This section synthesises what we see as the main challenges that human – robot interaction brings to Artificial Intelligence.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">They would need to be accounted for when grounding human – robot interaction.</a>
