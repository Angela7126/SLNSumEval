<a href="#0" id="0">We have already shown that weak SD proportionality implies possible envy-freeness for {a mathematical formula}n=2, and that possible envy-freeness implies weak SD envy-freeness.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then there exists no weak SD proportional discrete assignment because some agent will get fewer than {a mathematical formula}m/n objects.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A weak SD proportional discrete assignment exists if and only if a feasible b-matching exists for the graph corresponding to at least one of the {a mathematical formula} ∏ i=1n(ki+1) combinations of conditions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider the following assignment problem:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The discrete assignment that gives {a mathematical formula}{b,c,f} to agent 1 and {a mathematical formula}{d,e,a} to agent 2 is SD proportional.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Since m is not a multiple of n, an SD proportional assignment does not exist.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We say that an assignment satisfies {a mathematical formula}1/ Β weak proportionality if{a mathematical formula} We note that {a mathematical formula}1/n weak proportionality is equivalent to weak SD proportionality.</a>
