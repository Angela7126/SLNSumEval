<a href="#0" id="0">Based on such information, a robot has to understand the nature of the task, that is, it has to reason about how the physical effects of a manipulation action depend on the way the action is executed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, to perform the task itself, the robot has to understand how its own manipulation actions produce physical effects.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">6 shows the robot Rosie pushing the spatula under pancake and envisioning the action through mental simulation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition, we have integrated methods for making simulation-based temporal projections into Prolog's backtracking mechanism in order to perform reasoning about action parameterizations for robot manipulation tasks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In addition, the robot provides an instantiated action plan based on the plan's corresponding parameter space for pouring the ready-to-use pancake mix onto the pancake maker, flipping the half-baked pancake and placing the fully-baked pancake onto a plate.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, based on the envisioned timeline the robot is able to evaluate its parameterized action plan with respect to various performance measures, for example, whether the pancake mix was poured onto the pancake maker without spilling.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">One of the main constituents of the envisioning process is a physics-based simulation in which a specified robot performs manipulation actions according to its parameterized action plan.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula} For example, the event of cooking the pancake mix is formalized as{a mathematical formula} Actions of a robot can be represented similarly.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this paper, we presented a framework for envisioning the effects of everyday robot manipulation actions using physics-based simulations.</a>
