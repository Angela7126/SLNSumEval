<a href="#0" id="0">We assume a linear model for the generation of true AOD values, corrupted by a stochastic process as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}w ∈ RD is a weight vector, and {a mathematical formula} Ε i is a regression error due to zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance {a mathematical formula} Σ 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then, we can say that the target values {a mathematical formula}yi are sampled from the following Gaussian distribution,{a mathematical formula} Further, we assume that data points are independent and identically distributed (IID), and that expert predictions for the ith data point are sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution as{a mathematical formula} This assumption allows the experts to be correlated (i.e., {a mathematical formula} Σ K is non-diagonal), as is the case in practice in the aerosol domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This resulted in a labeled data set with {a mathematical formula}N=23,119 data points, where 67% of expert predictions were missing.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Both {a mathematical formula}xi and {a mathematical formula}x ˜ i vectors were always available for all data points.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We used this data set for three sets of experiments: (1) evaluating usefulness of unlabeled data; (2) evaluating usefulness of partitioning; and (3) evaluating usefulness of context-dependent prior over AOD values.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In all sets of experiments we performed leave-one-site-out cross-validation.</a>
