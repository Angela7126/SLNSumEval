<a href="#0" id="0">In the self-interested case, each agent attempts to maximize its individual expected utility as defined above.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the fully cooperative case, the agents are interested in the sum of the individual expected utilities, hence the optimal joint search strategy is the overall-expected-utility-maximizing strategy.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:8} A solution in this case is a set of search strategies, where each agent's strategy maximizes its own individual expected utility given the search strategies used by the other agents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this case, as we prove in the following paragraphs, the agent's strategy needs to take into consideration not only the best value obtained so far, as in the “ no communication ” case, but also the remaining number of potential search periods.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's strategy can thus be represented as the mapping {a mathematical formula}S(v,j) → pij(v), where {a mathematical formula}pij(v) is the probability that {a mathematical formula}Ai will choose to explore an additional opportunity when the number of remaining allowed searches is j and the best value obtained so far by all agents is v. We use {a mathematical formula}EBij(v) to denote the expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai if it follows the optimal search strategy, given the strategies used by the other agents, with j search opportunities remaining, and the best value obtained through all the agents' searches so far is v.</a>
