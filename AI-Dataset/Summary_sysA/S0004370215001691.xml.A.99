<a href="#1" id="1">The basic idea is simply to use the formula {a mathematical formula} Δ ⪰ Φ (M) associated to a model {a mathematical formula}M to obtain models that are not less preferred than {a mathematical formula}M. This algorithm takes as input a CNF formula Φ , a preference relation ⪰ , a strictly positive integer k, and a set X of propositional variables allowing to define the equivalence relation {a mathematical formula} ≈ X.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The problem of mining Top-k frequent closed patterns in a sequence {a mathematical formula}FCPSmink consists in computing all closed patterns with at least min items such that, for each one, there exist no more than {a mathematical formula}k − 1 closed patterns with at least min items and with supports greater than its support.</a>
