<a href="#0" id="0">In this study, we present a framework that comprises three main modules: 1) observation of human motions and object properties; 2) hierarchical interpretation of human behaviors; and 3) activity imitation by a robot.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The previous results were obtained using the label information when one human performed different activities with the right hand.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The results obtained after testing human activities performed by both hands demonstrated our comprehensive approach.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We found that rules obtained using the right hand ({a mathematical formula}Hsandwich) were also valid for inferring the activities performed by humans with the left hand.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, the obtained semantic rules were independent of the hand performing the activity because the meaning was the same.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the next step, we tested the information obtained from module 1 (see Section 7.1), i.e., from the automatic segmentation of human motions and object properties.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the previous subsections, we demonstrated that semantic rules obtained for human activities did not change under different constraints, e.g., time constraints, different scenarios, gender, or the hand used to execute the activity.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this subsection, we present the results obtained when we used the semantic rules to improve our reasoning engine and the knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, one branch of the tree obtained from Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">12 (see Section 7.2) was executed as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">15.a.4), i.e., the human activity inferred by the system, i.e., activity = Reach, was sent to the robot (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Correctly identifying human activities is a challenging task for the robotics community, but its solution is very important due to it is the first step toward more natural human â€“ robot interaction.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this study we proposed a method for extracting the meaning of basic human activities by combining hand motion information and two object properties.</a>
