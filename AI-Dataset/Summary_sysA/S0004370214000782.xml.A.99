<a href="#0" id="0">Given a dialogue{a mathematical formula} Δ ∈ D, for each actual argument{a mathematical formula}S ⊢ t Β drawn from the debate tree{a mathematical formula}T( Δ ), there exists an ABA argument{a mathematical formula}S ⊢ Β in the ABA framework drawn from Δ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By Definition 11.2 each debate tree in {a mathematical formula}F( Δ ) represents a set of arguments that support the claim of Δ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence each tree contains its own set of defence set, i.e., {a mathematical formula}DEF(T( Δ i)) is different from {a mathematical formula}DEF(T( Δ j)), where {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i,j ≤ n, {a mathematical formula}i ≠ j.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, if a defence set of a tree is grounded in the ABA framework drawn from the sub-dialogue, it is also grounded in the ABA framework drawn from the full-dialogue.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence Δ is g-successful as {a mathematical formula} Δ i is.</a>
