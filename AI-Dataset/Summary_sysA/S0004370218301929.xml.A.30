<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, let us consider LARS programs in which Α and each formula {a mathematical formula} Β i are positive, i.e., each atom occurs in the formula tree only under an even number of negations; we call such programs positive.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As for windows, we naturally call a window function wmonotonic, if for any streams S and {a mathematical formula}S ′ such that {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ S ′ and for any time {a mathematical formula}t ′ it holds that {a mathematical formula}w(S,t ′ ) ⊆ w(S ′ ,t ′ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We say that a stream {a mathematical formula}S=(T, Υ )is over a subset {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊆ A of atoms {a mathematical formula}A, if {a mathematical formula}v(t) ∖ A ′ = ∅ for all {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We study the complexity of the following reasoning tasks, where in the sequel W is a set of window functions that are evaluable in polynomial time, {a mathematical formula}B ⊆ A is a set of background atoms, and where Α is a ground LARS formula and P a ground LARS program.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Problem MC for LARS programs, i.e., given a structure{a mathematical formula}M= 〈 I,W,B 〉 , a data stream D, a program P, and a time point t, deciding whether{a mathematical formula}I=(T, Υ )is an answer stream of P for D at time t, is{a mathematical formula}PSpace-complete.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Concerning time-based window operators {a mathematical formula} ⊞ ℓ ,u(d), as already observed above, evaluating the window function {a mathematical formula} Τ ℓ ,u(d)(S,t) on the stream S at time point t always yields a substream {a mathematical formula}S ′ =(T ′ , Υ ′ )=(T ′ , Υ |T ′ ), i.e., {a mathematical formula}S ′ restricts S to the timeline {a mathematical formula}T ′ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If we apply a further time-based window on {a mathematical formula}S ′ , we obtain another stream of this form.</a>
