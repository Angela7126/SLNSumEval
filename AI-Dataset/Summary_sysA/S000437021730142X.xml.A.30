<a href="#0" id="0">The blending theory in principle allows for any finite number {a mathematical formula}S â‰¥ 2 input specifications, but in the implementation we use {a mathematical formula}S=2 for simplicity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This generic space is obtained by removing the {a mathematical formula}on(house,land) axiom from the House specification, the water operator and the {a mathematical formula}on(boat,water) axiom from the Boat specification, and by renaming the operators ride to liveIn, passenger to resident, boat to house and the sort Boat to House in the Boat specification.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The morphisms between the generic space and the input spaces are shown in the right part of Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Amalgam-based conceptual blending have been developed to blend {a mathematical formula}EL++ concepts in [10], [11], [13].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In these works, the generalisation of an {a mathematical formula}EL++ concept is achieved by means of a generalisation refinement operator.</a>
