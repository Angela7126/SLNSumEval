<a href="#0" id="0">Moreover, the statistical expectation of the fitness samples is referred to as the “ fitness measure of the trial solutions. ” On the basis of the proposed strategies, Goldberg's method [7] is extended to verify possible accommodation of slightly inferior population members in the optimal Pareto front.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Occurrence probability of the fitness samples: It is evident from the proposed nonuniform partitioning of the sample space that the fitness samples in the longer intervals are rare samples, probably owing to noise, and hence their contribution to the true fitness estimate of {a mathematical formula}X → i should not be regarded similarly to that of the fitness samples in the smaller interval.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The integrity of the work lies in the following: (1) adaptive selection of the sample size for the periodic fitness evaluation of a trial solution based on the fitness variance in the subpopulation surrounding it; (2) evaluation of the expected value of the fitness samples of a trial solution based on the nonuniform fitness sample distribution in the entire sample space; and (3) enhancing the robustness in selecting trial solutions from the same-rank candidate pool based on the selection probability influenced jointly by the crowding distance metric and the probability of nonoccurrence of rare (probably noisy) fitness samples.</a>
