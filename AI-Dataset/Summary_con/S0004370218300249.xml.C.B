<a href="#0" id="0">This survey identified seven major methodologies for agents modelling other agents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Surveyed methods include policy reconstruction, which seeks to reconstruct an agent's decision making based on its observed actions; type-based reasoning, which maintains beliefs over a space of alternative decision-making models to identify the most likely models based on observed actions; classification methods, which use machine learning to predict additional properties of interest such as behaviour classes and agent identities; plan recognition, which seeks to identify an agent's goals and plans using hierarchical action descriptions or domain models; recursive reasoning, which predicts an agent's actions by modelling its beliefs and the beliefs it ascribes to other agents; graphical models, which utilise graph structures to represent detailed dependence relations in an agent's decision making; and group modelling, in which models make joint predictions about a group of agents rather than single agents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also covered other relevant methods, including implicit modelling, hypothesis testing for agent models, and safe best-response methods.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, we identified a number of open problems which can provide fertile grounds for future research.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our survey of the literature shows that there exists a very large body of work on the topic of agents modelling other agents, broadly addressing questions of algorithmic design, experimental evaluation, theoretical guarantees, computational complexity, and observational constraints.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As research in artificial intelligence continues to pursue the goal of creating autonomous agents that interact with other agents to accomplish tasks in complex dynamic domains, we expect to see continued development towards addressing these questions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our hope is that this survey will contribute to this continued development by summarising the current state of research and exposing important open problems.</a>
