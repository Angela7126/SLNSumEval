<a href="#0" id="0">We presented a POMDP model for multi-object manipulation of unknown objects in a crowded environment.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Because objects are occluded, their attributes are harder to observe and they are harder to manipulate.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To address this, our POMDP model uses an occlusion ratio to define how much an object occludes another one.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We use the occlusion ratio as a parameter in the observation and grasp probabilities of objects.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In addition to occlusion specific grasp probabilities, our model also includes automatically adapting object specific grasp probabilities.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To compute compact policies for the computationally complex POMDP model, we presented a new POMDP method that optimizes a policy graph using particle filtering.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The method allows multi-step POMDP planning, both offline and online.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Experiments confirm that a heuristic greedy manipulation approach is not adequate for multi-object manipulation, but instead, the problem requires complex conditional multi-step POMDP plans that take long term effects into account.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Moreover, object specific grasp probabilities are needed in many real-world situations.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the future we plan to apply the presented POMDP model to other kinds of robotic tasks.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Currently, we are extending the POMDP model to take into account the uncertainty in the composition of objects from segments.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In general, to obtain true long-term autonomy, we believe that a robot should base its decisions on prior learned knowledge and adjust its world model to the specific environment it operates in.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For this purpose a probabilistic Bayesian framework should be used that allows the robot to operate and learn in an uncertain, unstructured environment.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In contrast to engineered solutions, learning offers the possibility to find solutions that generalize to unexpected situations and a possibility for autonomous adaptation.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Our goal is an autonomous robot which can be placed in a complex new environment and which then knows how to adapt to the new environment.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The work presented here is a step towards that goal.</a>
