<a href="#0" id="0">We have presented an epistemic version of postulates of merging which allow us to give very precise representation theorems (Theorem 3, Theorem 4, Theorem 5 and Proposition 1).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have also introduced new postulates with a more social flavor.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These postulates, except standard domain, have been characterized semantically (Proposition 5, Proposition 7, Proposition 8, Proposition 10).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have shown some tight relationships between the merging postulates and the social postulates; in particular, the ES quasifusion operators satisfy the Pareto condition (Proposition 6) and the ES fusion operators satisfy the unanimity condition (Proposition 4).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Actually, unlike the other social postulates, the standard domain postulate has a formulation which is very near to a semantical one, as Observation 1 establishes.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The social postulates together with the basic fusion postulates are enough to prove a general impossibility theorem: the ES basic fusion operators satisfying the standard domain, Pareto and independence conditions are indeed dictatorial operators (Theorem 7).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, the ES fusion operators satisfying the standard domain postulate and the independence condition are dictatorial operators (Corollary 1).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">One very interesting feature of our approach is that it gives interesting instantiations of the impossibility theorem (Theorem 7) for different representations of epistemic states.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, this applies to ordinal conditional functions, rational relations, and of course total preorders.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, the representation of epistemic states as formulas does not work because it is impossible to have standard domain in presence of a good representation of beliefs, namely the maximality condition.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This fact highlights the necessity of using complex epistemic states.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The concrete examples of Section 5 show that the standard domain and independence are not necessary conditions in order to have a dictatorial operator (see Table 2).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Having established the impossibility Theorem, it is natural to ask for general results of manipulability.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We have some work in progress in this direction.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">At the moment, we don't have an example of an ES fusion or quasifusion operator which is at the same time a dictatorial operator.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We conjecture that such kind of operators exists.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We think that Theorem 6 can be generalized to an arbitrary number of models greater than 4.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">However, the combinatorial analysis seems very complicated.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Finally, an interesting problem, open for further work, is to find a characterization of dictatorial operators.</a>
