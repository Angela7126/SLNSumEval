<a href="#0" id="0">We provided a detailed overview of SAT Challenge 2012, the main SAT solver competition organized in 2012.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We covered various aspects of the competition, including the rules, tracks, ranking scheme, and benchmark selection and generation process.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, we presented an in-depth analysis of the results of the competition — given that the number of participants and the distribution of their respective research groups is very high (recall Section 4) — the results of the competition arguably provide a snapshot of the state of the art in SAT solvers in 2012.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, we suggested a number of improvements to future SAT, and other similar, competitions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">SAT solver competitions have been one of the driving forces for progress achieved over the last one and a half decade in implementing SAT solvers.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Competitions can be seen as a community-wide algorithm engineering approach, in which different proposed algorithms and data structures are evaluated based on clear standards, and the results of the evaluation are passed back to the community to further improve their solvers.</a>
