<a href="#0" id="0">Regardless of significant advances in intelligent agents' social capabilities over the past decade, there remains a significant gap in their social intelligence that seriously limits the range of social phenomena that can be simulated.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To address this gap in social intelligence and, consequently, in the intelligence, expressiveness and believability of agents, we studied the links between different human cognitive processes, the different bases of social power and their underlying factors.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on fundamental insights from the social sciences, in which social power has long been studied, we introduced a mechanism for an agent's decision-making processes incorporating five bases of social power.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This mechanism was then integrated into a cognitive architecture for social-power-intelligent agents following an integrative conceptualization of social power.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The modeled bases of social power are those of reward, coercive, legitimate, referent and expert power.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Social power awareness with regard to different bases of social power enables agents to manipulate several social concepts related to important social processes and consequently enables more socially situated intelligent interactions between agents and users.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To describe the proposed social power mechanism, we discussed each base of social power in detail, from their definition to their dynamics in a social environment.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By doing so, we clearly identified the types of situations and the range of behaviors that can be represented.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Additionally, when conceptualizing the developed agent architecture, we identified three core social power processes (“Power Situational Analysis”, “Power Effect Assessment” and “Power Interaction Planning”) and described their integration with the typical agent processes of sensing, reasoning and interaction in a given environment.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Beyond the core processes required to operationalize social power in an agent environment, the developed social power model enabled us to integrate several social constructs that can be used to parameterize agent social behavior.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Of particular interest is the relation between personality and individualized agent behaviors, motivations for diverse motivational forces and separate mental models associated with Theory of Mind capabilities.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">A key contribution of this work is the integration of the conceptualization of social power with social psychology models, enabling us to measure the characteristics of individuals through validated questionnaires such that these measurements can be subsequently used to parameterize our model.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As a result, the developed framework provides a clearly structured approach for authoring social simulations based on characteristics that not only are readily identifiable but can be measured in people.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Based on the developed architecture, we implemented the SAPIENT agent framework to create social-power-intelligent behavior in a context-independent manner, thereby facilitating the adaptation of the agents to different situations.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Using this framework, we created a virtual environment to explore a setting for human–agent interaction that enabled us to perform a user study to assess users' perceptions regarding the social power awareness of SAPIENT agents and their experience in interacting with such agents.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As a result, we found evidence supporting the hypothesis that the developed social power model is valuable for the development of agent systems that require social-power-intelligent behaviors.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Additionally, we found evidence indicating that agents implemented using the developed model provide a positive interaction experience; in particular, they exhibit higher believability compared with scripted agents (unrelated to any insights from the social sciences).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">However, some measurements were inconclusive, and we therefore proposed extensions to the experimental design to strengthen the current results.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Furthermore, as a future direction of research to consolidate the evidence from the pilot user study, we believe that a new study consisting of a Wizard of Oz experiment should be conduced to compare the behavior of SAPIENT agents with human behavior.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">One future extension of the presented work would be to expand the effect mechanisms to more extensively cover factor-specific dynamics (e.g., norm dynamics) that were beyond the scope of the current study but have an important impact on social power dynamics.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Another future possibility would be to extend the model to consider the effects of multiple influencing actors in a given situation.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Nevertheless, the mechanisms and framework described in the present paper can already be used to improve agents' intelligence in a variety of contexts and applications.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Our goal is to use the developed agent model in several settings.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">A first application will be the integration of the framework into a component-based asset repository for inclusion in applied games for the training of social skills.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">{sup:28} The model will thus be used in interactive virtual agent-based settings to improve training applications (e.g., serious games for leadership) and enhance social simulation games{sup:29} (e.g., role-playing or simulation games with more dynamic character social interactions).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Other future applications include multi-agent simulations to study social power dynamics as a function of variations in agents' personal motivations, their personalities and the structure of the social environment in which they interact.</a>
