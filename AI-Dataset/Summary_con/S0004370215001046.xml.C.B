<a href="#0" id="0">In this study, we proposed a feature assembly method, where utilizing six constraint conditions, the assembled features can capture the local dependency from relation instances.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We also described the omni-word feature in detail.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Both the feature assembly method and omni-word feature can make better use of the information in a sentence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly improves Chinese and English relation extraction.</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">In future research, it will be necessary to address the identification of structural characteristics in linguistics (e.g., entity mentions in the present study), which is an important issue when grouping features into different sets (candidate features).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Furthermore, two issues can be explored further that affect the feature assembly method.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First, for other information extraction tasks (e.g., coreference resolution), the best way to use this model and how to find new constraint conditions remain open issues.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Second, in the assembled feature method, the number of features can grow exponentially, but large numbers of features are expensive to process and this could decrease the ability to use more constraint conditions.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore, to overcome this shortcoming, techniques such as feature selection can be employed.</a>
