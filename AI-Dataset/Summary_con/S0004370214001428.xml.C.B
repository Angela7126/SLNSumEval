<a href="#0" id="0">We have introduced the backdoor approach to the domain of propositional answer set programming.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In a certain sense, the backdoor approach allows us to augment known tractable classes and makes efficient solving methods for tractable classes generally applicable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our approach makes recent progress in fixed-parameter algorithmics applicable to answer set programming and establishes a unifying approach that accommodates several parameters from the literature.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This framework gives rise to a detailed comparison of the various parameters in terms of their generality.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We introduce a general method of lifting parameters from normal to disjunctive programs and establish several basic properties of this method.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We further studied the preprocessing limits of ASP rules in terms of kernelization taking backdoor size as the parameter.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The results and concepts of this paper give rise to several research questions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For instance, it would be interesting to consider backdoors for target classes that contain programs with an exponential number of answer sets, but where the set of all answer sets can be succinctly represented.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A simple example is the class of programs that consist of (in)dependent components of bounded size.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It would be interesting to enhance our backdoor approach to extended rules in particular to weight constraints.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">An interesting further research direction is to study whether and how backdoors can be used to control modern heuristics in ASP solvers to obtain a speed-up.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We do not expect a practically competitive heuristic that is purely based on backdoors and does not take other aspects of ASP solving into account.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Therefore, a conclusive evaluation requires a rigorous experimental setup that takes the interaction of various heuristic methods into account (e.g., interaction of solver techniques [101] and tuning of parameter values [88], modifying the branching heuristic by caching truth values of atoms and reusing them [127], modifying the atom score initially, or while learning conflict clauses, or at a certain depth of the search).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">So far various studies and theoretical considerations on the effect of restricting decision heuristics to a subset of variables based on structural properties have been carried out in the context of SAT and ASP, where both positive [80], [81], [143], [75] and negative effects [96], [95] have been observed.</a>
