<a href="#0" id="0">This paper contributes to the emerging research direction on modularity-based properties and techniques in abstract argumentation, by introducing a novel comprehensive formal corpus to describe the Input/Output behavior of argumentation frameworks along with the relevant semantics properties, and by providing a systematic assessment of seven well-known argumentation semantics in this context.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Due to their foundational nature, we believe these results may play an enabling role in the development of a variety of more specific investigation lines, ranging from the sound combination of heterogeneous semantics to the definition of reusable argumentation patterns.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As to future work, in addition to the many issues already included in the discussion of Section 10, we mention three further interesting lines.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, the extension of the analysis carried out in the paper to other literature semantics like the ones mainly based on the notion of conflict-freeness (e.g. stage [41], CF2 [7], [10], stage2 [30] semantics) or those featuring a parametric definition (e.g. resolution-based semantics [6]).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Second, the study of argumentation synthesis problems, namely, given a desired Input/Output behavior generating an argumentation framework which produces it, possibly under some constraints concerning its structure and/or the semantics to be adopted.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Third, a systematic definition of modularity-related variations of traditional computational problems in abstract argumentation, e.g. checking whether two multipoles are equivalent according to a given semantics, and the analysis of their complexity properties.</a>
