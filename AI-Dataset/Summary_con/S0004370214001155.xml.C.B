<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we have investigated belief revision in Horn clause theories.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We showed that AGM belief revision doesn't immediately generalise to the Horn case and that, in the naïve extension of AGM revision to Horn clause theories, several problems arise.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We address these issues by first restricting the semantic construction involving faithful rankings to “well behaved” orderings, those that we call Horn compliant.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As well, we augment the revision postulates by an additional postulate (Acyc).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Notably, these results represent an extension rather than a modification of the AGM approach.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">That is, we have redefined (AGM-style) revision in the context of a logic, Horn logic, that is weaker than propositional logic.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Postulates consist of (H*1)–(H*8) and (Acyc), while the construction is in terms of Horn compliant faithful rankings.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This however subsumes classical AGM revision: classical propositional logic obviously is stronger than Horn logic.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In classical propositional logic the notion corresponding to Horn compliance is trivial, since (over a finite alphabet) for any formula ϕ of propositional logic, {a mathematical formula}min⁡([ϕ],⪯) is definable via a formula of propositional logic.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">On the postulational side, as we showed, (Acyc) is derivable from the other postulates in the context of classical propositional logic.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">What this means, in other words, is that if one takes the approach developed herein, but replaces Horn logic by classical propositional logic, one ends up with the standard AGM approach.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We also showed that Horn revision is compatible with work in iterated revision and work concerning relevance in revision.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We also considered specific revision operators: while the analogues of Dalahand Satoh-style revision are incompatible with Horn revision, we proposed two specific revision operators, both with good complexity characteristics.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">These results suggest several (in our opinion) very interesting directions for future work.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">First, we argued that AGM revision can be extended by weakening the underlying logic to that of Horn logic.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This raises the issue of whether the overall framework can be generalised to subsume other weakened inference relations, while maintaining the overall AGM character as reflected in the standard AGM postulates.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The broader area of belief change in Horn theories is in the process of being mapped out.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Other research has characterized Horn contraction, while the present paper has addressed revision.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">However, with the exception of [32], which considers the definition of Horn revision in terms of contraction, there has been no work that we are aware of in linking the areas of Horn contraction and revision.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Moreover, the constructions in Horn contraction have focussed on the standard contraction constructions of remainder sets and epistemic entrenchment, while the present work has used the standard revision construction of a faithful ranking.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Hence there is also a disconnect in the underlying formal characterizations.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Consequently, research on linking Horn contraction and revision would help shed further light on the foundations of belief change.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Last, there is burgeoning interest in addressing belief change in description logics (see [26] for instance) or in analogous areas such as ontology evolution.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Given that a Horn clause may also find interpretation as a subsumption, by mapping a rule {a mathematical formula}p→q to a subsumption of the form {a mathematical formula}P⊑Q, the present approach may also shed light on approaches to revision in description logics.</a>
