<a href="#0" id="0">The theorem shows that conditionality (↣) and non-monotonic inferribility ({a mathematical formula}|∼) have the same logic.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">But there are three important caveats.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, the theorem was proved in one specific framework.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">There may be other frameworks in which both the Ramsey test and the co-occurrence test can be represented.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The corresponding theorem may not be obtainable in all such frameworks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Secondly, although the theorem provides us with a reconstruction of any co-occurrence test as a Ramsey test, this derived Ramsey test is based on another initial belief set and another operation of belief revision than those referred to in the co-occurrence test that we started with.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, the logical properties that connect ↣ to K or to ⁎ need not hold if we replace ↣ by {a mathematical formula}|∼, and vice versa.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">(The property CS mentioned in Section 2 is an example of this.)</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thirdly and most importantly, according to the theorem conditionality and non-monotonic inferribility obey the same logical principles but do not coincide.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This is not an unusual situation.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Logical necessity and physical necessity may both have the same (S5) logic, but that is no reason to conflate them [8, pp.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">104–105], cf.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">[3] and [5].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In social choice theory, we usually assume that different persons' preferences satisfy the same logical rules, but in all non-trivial cases they differ in substance.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Similarly, the analysis provided here gives us reason to treat conditionality and (non-monotonic) inferribility as distinct notions that satisfy the same logical principles.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Possibly, the similarity of their logics has blinded us to the differences between the two concepts.</a>
