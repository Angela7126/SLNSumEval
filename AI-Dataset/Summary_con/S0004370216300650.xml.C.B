<a href="#0" id="0">We have presented a new learning scheme based on inference of general constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We presented the development of various inference rules that are necessary for this scheme, but it is clear that there is still a lot of work in deriving such rules for additional popular pairs of constraints which are currently not supported and force HCSP into a fallback solution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition, currently learning general constraints is incompatible with producing machine-checkable proofs in case the formula is unsatisfiable, in contrast to our earlier explanation-based method [11] (i.e., in [11] we presented a method for producing a signed-resolution proof in case the formula is unsatisfiable, which relies on clausal explanations).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">HCSP is written in C++, contains 23k lines of non-comment code, and its architecture enables the addition of new constraints and new rules without changing the core solver.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is free software available from [38] under the GPL license.</a>
