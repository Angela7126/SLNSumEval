<a href="#0" id="0">We have proposed here a formalism extending Gärdenfors' conceptual spaces theory, so as to incorporate the vagueness of natural language using a random set based prototype model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The framework we propose gives a mechanism for forming concepts as a combination of properties from integral domains.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The innovation we have introduced here is that these properties are mapped into a binary combination space which itself is treated as a conceptual space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have shown that the idea of concepts as weighted sums of properties, proposed by Gärdenfors and Zadeh, arises naturally as a special case of our framework, namely when the threshold of the concept in the binary combination space is uniformly distributed across the whole space (Theorem 4).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also characterise the combination weights as the necessity of a property to the concept, using the technical definition of necessity from possibility theory.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The framework we propose is hierarchical.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, combinations may consist of multiple properties, as described above, or, as we describe in section 4.3.2, of two or more concepts which are themselves defined as combinations of properties.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Again, under certain specific conditions, we can recover the results reported in [22] that the importance of properties in a conjunction of concepts is a weighted sum of the importance of the properties to the individual concepts.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We also show how our framework can be applied to property–concept combination.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In fact, the distinction between properties and concepts is somewhat artificial, and the conjunctive combination of any sort of concept can be performed within this framework.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A key element of human concept use, however, is that there are various instances where concepts cannot be adequately characterised as a simple weighted sum of properties.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We can account for this by using our more general model, in which the threshold in the binary combination space does not have to be distributed according to the uniform distribution.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">A key result is that necessity and impossibility are carried through from constituent concepts into the combined concept.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We have shown in Example 18 how our characterisation of the importance of an attribute in terms of the concept of necessity from possibility theory allows us to take account of this phenomenon.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We have further shown how attribute loss and emergence, characterised as the diminished or increased importance of an attribute to a combined concept, may occur, as illustrated in Fig. 10.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We have also explained how non-commutativity and dominance effects may be modelled, by setting the weights used in the binary combination space.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Hampton finds that in general, the second noun in the conjunction is given more weight than the first.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">This aspect could simply be built in to the weighting.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Dominance effects are seen when one concept has more features than the other.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Again, weightings could take this into account.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We have given examples to show how two of the key problems in this area may be accounted for.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">These are the conjunction fallacy and the guppy effect, illustrated in Example 19, Example 20 respectively.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">We therefore argue that our framework is better able to account for key aspects of human use of concepts than standard conceptual spaces approaches [2], [6], which do not attempt to account for these non-compositional features.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">In contrast, the quantum approach has shown examples of how to account for this type of problem, and has done so successfully.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">We argue, however, that our approach is more conceptually straightforward than the quantum approach, with the formulation of the latter requiring high dimensional Hilbert spaces and the mathematics of quantum mechanics.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">At present, our model does not distinguish between membership in and typicality to a concept.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">There is certainly a difference between these two notions, and an effective model of concepts should elucidate how these two ideas can be unified, or accounted for.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Hampton [24] argues that membership and typicality may be subsumed within one approach, on the basis that membership may be decided by applying a suitable threshold to typicality.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">This type of approach could easily be incorporated into our model.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">We might ask where the threshold should be placed.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">However, we could simply place the threshold at 0.5 everywhere and then tune the weights of the model, rather than having separate thresholds for each concept.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">The approach we have proposed here is particularly well-suited to concepts that can be described via a collection of attributes.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">However, some types of concepts are less well-suited to this type of description.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">For example, some concepts may be defined crisply in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions, such as the concept of even numbers.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Another example, given by Barsalou [8] is that of goal-derived categories.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">These are defined by the extent to which they allow a goal to be reached.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">So attributes for ‘things to eat on a diet’ has as an ideal ‘foods with zero calories’.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">These tend not to be central to a concept, although they could still be seen as prototypical in some way.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Another example given is that of ‘ad-hoc categories’, in particular ‘things to sell at a garage sale’.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Barsalou argues that these cannot really be defined by a specific set of attributes.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">With regard to goal-derived categories, we argue that to a certain extent, we can view the ideals as attributes to be achieved.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Therefore, these could still be used as dimension in a conceptual space.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Ideals may not be central tendencies, however, we do not require this in our model, since typicality to a concept is defined via a probability distribution based on distance to a prototype.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">Simply setting the probability to 0 on one side of the prototype allows for non-central ideals.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">However, the example of ad-hoc categories does suggest further work.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">We may view categories defined via attributes as conjunctive in some sense: we use conjunctions of attributes.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">However ad-hoc categories are defined disjunctively: this old bicycle or these tins of paint etc.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">A movement from disjunctive to conjunctively defined categories might be viewed as a type of learning: children might see the concept ‘cat’ as defined by ‘Tibbles or Patch’, but later extract the attributes that allow generalisation.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">This would be an interesting area for further work.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">In particular, when using a semantic vector space approach, for example in statistical analysis of text corpora, the vectors created are formed of a mixture of instances of the concept, that would go into a disjunctive definition of the concept, and attributes, that would go into a conjunctive definition.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">An analysis of when a disjunctive or conjunctive definition is more appropriate, and the interaction between the two in, for example, learning concepts, would be of interest.</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">A further area for investigation would be to look at the questions raised by [1], [27] concerning privative adjectives, i.e., those where the application of the adjective entails that the adjective-noun combination is no longer an instance of the noun.</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">Examples are ‘artificial’, ‘former’, ‘fake’, and so on.</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">Using the combination of the conjunctive and the hedged approach given in [36] might be of use here, to develop these more complex ‘type 2’ hedges, as Lakoff calls them [30].</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">An analysis of the effects of the hedges might be to say, for example, that the hedge ‘fake’ increases the weight of those attributes that are visually important, and decreases the weight of the other most important attributes.</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">An alternative approach would be to tag ‘definitional’ attributes that the hedge ‘fake’ can then negate.</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">More generally, the semantic differences between different types of adjectives that [41] discuss should be considered in further work.</a>
<a href="#57" id="57">Adjectives that consist of modifying one property of a concept are well described by our model.</a>
<a href="#58" id="58">Some of the more complicated adjectives such as ‘abusive’ may be more difficult to describe.</a>
<a href="#59" id="59">Part of the work must be done by giving such an adjective an adequate representation in a conceptual space.</a>
<a href="#60" id="60">Then the application of the adjective may consist of adding domains to its noun, or modifying existing domains.</a>
<a href="#61" id="61">The potential for application of this model should be discussed.</a>
<a href="#62" id="62">As presented here, in its full generality, the model has a large number of free parameters, and a number of these need to be pinned down before they can be used.</a>
<a href="#63" id="63">Various choices must be made before the model can be applied.</a>
<a href="#64" id="64">For example, the type of threshold distribution is likely to be very dependent on the type of concept or property that is being described.</a>
<a href="#65" id="65">Further, the type of normalisation that we might want to apply to the dimensions must be carefully chosen or learned from the data.</a>
<a href="#66" id="66">We give here a number of possible applications of the model and describe how the parameters can be limited in those cases.</a>
<a href="#67" id="67">Firstly, the model can be applied as a model of concept combination in examining psychological data.</a>
<a href="#68" id="68">In [34] the model is applied to a range of data from [24], [23], [22].</a>
<a href="#69" id="69">An example of the type of data is as follows.</a>
<a href="#70" id="70">Participants were asked to rate the membership of instances such as ‘Penguin’, ‘Dog’, ‘Cockatoo’, and so on in concepts and their combinations – in this example, the concepts would be ‘Birds’, ‘Pets’, ‘Birds which are Pets’, and ‘Pets which are Birds’.</a>
<a href="#71" id="71">Hampton's original analysis finds that mean typicality ratings can be systematically predicted using a multilinear regression.</a>
<a href="#72" id="72">We apply the same analysis to the mean membership ratings of the items.</a>
<a href="#73" id="73">The model we use maps each of the constituent concepts into a binary combination space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2.</a>
<a href="#74" id="74">Each dimension of this space is weighted, with the weights summing to 1, resulting in weight vector {a mathematical formula}(λ,1−λ).</a>
<a href="#75" id="75">The threshold ε in the binary space is distributed uniformly, {a mathematical formula}ε∼U(0,b).</a>
<a href="#76" id="76">We therefore fit just two parameters λ and b. This gives us the expression{a mathematical formula} Hampton uses a multilinear regression given by:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#77" id="77">We therefore use fewer parameters than does Hampton to fit this data.</a>
<a href="#78" id="78">The fit we achieve is comparable to Hampton's when using Akaike's ‘An Information Criterion’ for small samples ({a mathematical formula}AICc).</a>
<a href="#79" id="79">Another way to reduce the number of parameters is to make the simplifying assumption that the threshold in the higher level space is distributed according to the assumptions of Theorem 4, i.e., that the combination of concepts is simply a weighted sum of membership values.</a>
<a href="#80" id="80">This assumption was used in investigating the adoption of conjunctive concepts in a multi-agent simulation of language evolution [34], [35].</a>
<a href="#81" id="81">In this application, agents are equipped with a range of basic concepts which they use to communicate about points in a conceptual space.</a>
<a href="#82" id="82">Via iterated dialogues, agents converge onto a shared set of dimension weights that characterise the space.</a>
<a href="#83" id="83">The weights to which agents converge is determined by the distribution of objects within the conceptual space.</a>
<a href="#84" id="84">Applications of the theory might also be possible in online classification tasks, for example in film.</a>
<a href="#85" id="85">In an analogue to the ‘pet fish’ phenomenon, a film might not have typical characteristics of a horror film, nor of a comedy film, but be prototypical of a ‘comedy horror’.</a>
<a href="#86" id="86">In this cases, a weighted sum formulation on its own is not able to account for these phenomena.</a>
<a href="#87" id="87">The fact that comedies and horror do not share many characteristics might be taken to be diagnostic of the fact that ‘non-compositional’ effects may be seen here.</a>
<a href="#88" id="88">Further, we have not yet developed a theory for how to deal with contradictory attributes.</a>
<a href="#89" id="89">These will be key to how non-compositional effects arise, and a simple weighted sum combination does not explain these in a satisfactory manner.</a>
<a href="#90" id="90">Within the framework we have discussed conjunction and disjunction of nouns and adjectives.</a>
<a href="#91" id="91">There are, of course, many other operators and word types that should be captured in a full account of concepts.</a>
<a href="#92" id="92">Gärdenfors and Warglien have started to develop conceptual spaces for verbs [21], [48], and Gärdenfors has begun the development of a semantics for conceptual spaces [20].</a>
<a href="#93" id="93">Other approaches to developing a full semantics use the notion of a semantic vector space, based on text corpora [11], [38].</a>
<a href="#94" id="94">Our model could be extended to include other word types and composition types.</a>
<a href="#95" id="95">Within our framework we have explicitly avoided the problem of conflicting prototypes.</a>
<a href="#96" id="96">However, this is an area which must be developed.</a>
<a href="#97" id="97">One important aspect of conflicting prototypes is that having conflicting attributes allows interesting phenomena to emerge.</a>
<a href="#98" id="98">This goes hand in hand with another aspect that we have not discussed: the need for some sort of inference system.</a>
<a href="#99" id="99">A key element of our framework is the weights given to dimensions in the combination space.</a>
<a href="#100" id="100">Results in [35] and ongoing work show that within a multi-agent model of language users, these weights can be related to the distribution of elements in the conceptual space, explaining why and how different dimensions should have different weights.</a>
<a href="#101" id="101">Further research will investigate how attributes may affect one another.</a>
<a href="#102" id="102">For instance, in the pet fish example, the attributes ‘furry’ and ‘scaly’ might interact since they are, to some extent, incompatible.</a>
<a href="#103" id="103">This is not examined so far, and indeed we require that the constituent concepts may not have contradictory prototypes.</a>
<a href="#104" id="104">Further developing the framework for these cases is likely to allow even more effective modelling of non-compositional effects.</a>
