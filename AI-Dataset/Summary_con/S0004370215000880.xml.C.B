<a href="#0" id="0">We have presented a taxonomy of fairness concepts under ordinal preferences, and identified the relationships between the concepts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Compared to refinements of the responsive set extension to define fairness concepts [12], using cardinal utilities and the SD relation to define fairness concepts not only gives more flexibility (for example reasoning about entitlements) but can also be convenient for algorithm design.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A problem with the fairness concepts presented in the paper was that the set of fair outcomes is not guaranteed to be non-empty.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In view of this we highlighted in Section 8 how alternative notions of maximal and maximum fairness are useful and how the respective computational problems are related to each other.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Another possible way to circumvent non-existence of SD proportional or weak SD proportional assignments is to define less stringent notions by replacing the reference vector {a mathematical formula}(1n,â€¦,1n) with a reference vector with {a mathematical formula}1/n replaced by some constant.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We show that an optimal proportional discrete assignment can be computed in polynomial time whereas an optimal weak proportional discrete assignment can be computed in polynomial time if the number of agents is bounded.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Both fairness notions appear to promising solution concepts for fair division of indivisible objects.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">They are also compatible with Pareto optimality.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The optimal notions can be further refined with respect to leximin refinements.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">There are number of directions for future research.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The complexity of finding a weak SD proportional discrete assignment remains open for an unbounded number of agents with non-strict preferences.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The complexity of checking whether an SD envy-free assignment exists for a bounded number of agents is open.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">It will be interesting to see how various approximation algorithms in the literature designed to reduce envy or maximize welfare fare in terms of satisfying ordinal notions of fairness (see, e.g., [9], [13], [39]).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Examining other dominance notions may also be fruitful [34].</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Another avenue for positive algorithmic results is to consider parameterized algorithms.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Finally, strategic aspects of ordinal fairness is another interesting direction for future research.</a>
