<a href="#0" id="0">We study the problem of optimally protecting an election against group-deletion-control, including destructive and constructive control.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show that plurality voting is vulnerable to group-level destructive control, but is resistant to constructive control.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition, it is computationally hard to protect an election in either destructive or constructive control settings.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For defense against destructive control, we propose a double-oracle framework for computing an optimal protection strategy and develop compact mixed integer linear programs for both oracles.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also propose heuristic oracles to further speed up the double oracle framework.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For defense against constructive control, we present a mixed integer linear programming approach to compute the SSE of the game.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Because this method is itself intractable, we also propose a greedy heuristic algorithm and several zero-sum approximation approaches, which provide upper and lower bounds on the defender's optimal solution.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches for both destructive and constructive control are effective, far more so than several alternatives.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Moreover, we observe that our approach for constructive control which relies on zero-sum approximations actually computes an optimal solution for the defender in nearly every instance.</a>
