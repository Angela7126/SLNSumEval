<a href="#0" id="0">In this study, we showed that AI techniques can be efficiently integrated into robotic platforms to learn and execute human-like tasks by exploiting natural teacher–learner interactions involving a human.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Whenever a robotic execution plan halts, the human teaches an appropriate action and the robot can then complete the task by itself.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For a given task, our results show that this type of online learning facilitates rapid convergence on a set of POs, which finally allows the agent to perform the task autonomously.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this study, our main focus was only to instruct actions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is easier and more typical of human–human cooperative work, rather than always instructing both actions and (all) action consequences.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The robot was allowed to discover the cause–effect relationships of these actions autonomously to complete the missing POs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A major feature of the proposed method that allows correct POs to be found is our development of an efficient approach that permits the robot to determine unchanged causative conditions as well as the actions that lead to the observed changes.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We showed that this problem can be solved using an easy-to-implement approach that evaluates different combinations of conditions in parallel while considering the lack of experience, which is fundamental for preventing biased estimates when learning based on a few trials.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this manner, we suggest that simple natural human instructions can be used to trigger task-relevant actions, while plain fast learning can be used to immediately generate POs simply from observed state transitions to rapidly increase the autonomy of the robot.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, the main contribution of this study is the development of a method that can help make robots part of our world, where they might help us rapidly without requiring tedious programming or complex interactions.</a>
