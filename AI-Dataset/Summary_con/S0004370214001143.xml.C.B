<a href="#0" id="0">Our paper demonstrates that humans do not naturally provide the best possible examples when they teach an arbitrary machine learner.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We proposed teaching guidance as a mechanism to influence human teaching towards being more useful for the learner.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We discussed how the nature of such guidance changes based on the problem type, and demonstrated its utility in three different domains.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Across all of our experiments, teaching guidance helped people achieve better teaching performance.</a>
