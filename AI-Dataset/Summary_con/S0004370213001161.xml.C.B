<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we developed a new algorithm{sup:6} for enumerating preferred extensions of an af.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have shown that the new algorithm is more efficient than existing algorithms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Likewise, we implemented algorithms that decide the credulous and skeptical acceptance problems without explicitly enumerating all preferred extensions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Supported by experiments, we showed that these algorithms are more efficient than existing algorithms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, we engineered labelling-based algorithms in vafs for enumerating preferred extensions and deciding subjective/objective acceptance.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Opening perspectives for further developments, we see the potential of our algorithm to be used, after appropriate changes, for enumerating extensions under other argumentation semantics such as the ideal semantics, stage semantics and semi-stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Also, we plan to extend our work to investigate other generalizations of Dung ºs model such as varied-strength attack systems [41].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Nonetheless, it is just a matter of modifying our algorithm to make it functional in some other generalizations such as [6].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this work we adopted a basic rule for selecting the next argument that induces a transition from a parent node to a child node within the search tree.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We plan to explore more heuristics-based selection options, especially those with somewhat expensive overheads.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This is to see how far we can rely on such involved rules in gaining improved efficiency.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Similarly, further strategies for pruning the search space are to be studied.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Our current methods are based on a preliminary look-ahead strategy.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">It is still open whether or not foreseeing further the search space in advance of expanding it will be of any benefit in terms of the overall performance.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Finally, in the context of multi-agent systems, we note that the presented notions: labelling transition, argument selection and pruning strategies are rich concepts that potentially have a relevant role in designing efficient dialogs for different scenarios.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">However, this is to be seen by further investigations.</a>
