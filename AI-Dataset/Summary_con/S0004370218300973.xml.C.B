<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a novel deep-learning-based model (called ST-ResNet) for forecasting the flow of crowds in each and every region of a city, based on historical spatio-temporal data, weather and events.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our proposed ST-ResNet is capable of learning all spatial (nearby and distant) and temporal (closeness, period, and trend) dependencies as well as external factors (e.g. weather, event).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We evaluate our model on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and NYC, achieving performances which are significantly beyond 9 baseline methods, confirming that our model is better and more applicable to the crowd flow prediction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The code and datasets have been released at: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/deep-spatio-temporal-residual-networks-for-citywide-crowd-flows-prediction.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We develop a Cloud-based system, called UrbanFlow, that can monitor the real-time crowd flows and provide the forecasting crowd flows in near future using our ST-ResNet.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the future, we will consider other types of flows (e.g. metro card swiping data, taxi/truck/bus trajectory data, and phone signals data), and use all of them to generate more types of flow predictions, and collectively predict all of these flows with an appropriate fusion mechanism.</a>
