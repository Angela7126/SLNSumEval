<a href="#0" id="0">Due to limitations of human I/O capabilities, the management of information at a Web scale calls for automatic mechanisms and thus machine-processable information.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper we have shown that maps, key devices in helping human navigation in information spaces, are meaningful on the Web space, and furthermore, their generation and manipulation can be semi-automated.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our proposal offers a refreshing perspective to the idea of Associative Trails defined by V. Bush in his proposal of the Memex [57].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our framework enables a user to automatically build “a trail of his interest in the maze of materials available” on the Web.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We think that the formal models presented here are a starting point to further develop the discipline of cartography on the Web.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have shown the feasibility of such formal models by implementing them over the current Web infrastructure (i.e., data and languages today available).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As a proof of concept in this paper, we used the {a mathematical formula}L language and the notion of k-map, and we are aware that the framework developed would benefit from using other languages and notions of relevant maps.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In particular, the maps we discussed are represented as unlabeled graphs.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is because maps can be labeled according to different strategies, for instance, path length or summary of labels in the represented paths.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this version, we remain “neutral” with respect to the labeling to highlight the very general idea of map.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">But clearly a map with labeled edges is also interesting.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In particular, each edge in the map abstracts a set of paths between distinguished nodes in the region.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Since edges in a path (a sequence of RDF predicates) can have different labels, assigning a single label to each edge in the map does not reflect the meaning of the paths they represent.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To overcome this problem, each edge of the map could be labeled with a regular expression summarizing all the paths connecting such nodes in the region.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This way also information about the sequences of edge labels between distinguished nodes in the region would remain in the map.</a>
