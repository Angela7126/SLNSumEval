<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we have presented a multi-stage stochastic formulation for online assignment of servers to customers and a Benders Decomposition of the formulation to deal with large numbers of future scenarios.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We provide crucial theoretical results that indicate the complexity of the problem and the worst case performance obtained by greedy and multi-stage approaches.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition, we have compared the assignment computed by our algorithms against multiple existing myopic and multi-stage algorithms (including an approach for solving MDPs online).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We found that our algorithms are able to provide a significant gain in performance over all the current best approaches on three different taxi data sets.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also created synthetic scenarios and demonstrated certain revenue models and zone configurations (which typically do not occur in real taxi domains) where our approaches do not provide improvements.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the future, we would like to extend this work to support queuing of requests and multi-capacity servers to address the general pickup and delivery problems with time windows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We are also exploring how anonymity and homogeneity (key ideas that are exploited in this paper) can be used to improve the performance of online MMDPs.</a>
