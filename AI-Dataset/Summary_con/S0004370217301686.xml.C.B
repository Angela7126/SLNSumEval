<a href="#0" id="0">The contribution of this paper is threefold.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First, we provided a generalization of AGM postulates, in a slightly weaker form from a model-theoretic point of view, in the abstract model theory of satisfaction systems, so as they become applicable to a wide class of non-classical logics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this framework, we then generalized to any satisfaction systems the characterization of the AGM postulates given by Katsuno and Mendelzon for propositional logic in terms of minimal change with respect to an ordering among interpretations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This work generalizes the previous ones in the area.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It also suggests the theory behind satisfaction systems to be a principled framework for dealing with knowledge dynamics with the growing interest on non-classical logics such as DL.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We do hope that bridges can thus be built, by working at the cross-road of different areas of theoretical computer science.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Secondly, we proposed a general framework for defining revision operators based on the notion of relaxation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We demonstrated that such a relaxation-based framework for belief revision satisfies the weakened AGM postulates.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As a byproduct, we give a principled formal flavor to several operators defined in the literature (e.g. weakening operators defined in DL).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thirdly, we introduced a number of concrete relaxations within the scope of description logics, discussed their properties and illustrated them through simple examples.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It was out of the scope of this paper to discuss languages such as OWL.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However, the proposed approach could be applied to SROIQ and implemented in OWL, by augmenting a relaxation with operations on complex constructors.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Future works will concern the study of the complexity of the introduced operators, the comparison of their induced ordering, and their generalization to more expressive DL as well as other non-classical logics such as first-order Horn logics or equational logics.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Finally, there is an extension of satisfaction systems that takes into account explicitly the notion of signatures, the theory of institutions [19], a categorical model theory which has emerged in computing science studies of software specifications and semantics.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In this paper, as we have considered logical theories over a same signature, signature morphisms and their interpretation for model classes and sentence sets were not relevant.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">However, these results carry over to institutions, which are indexed satisfaction systems.</a>
