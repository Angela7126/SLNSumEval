<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we considered the problem of generating robust and accurate plans, when the agent only has access to incomplete domain models, supplanted by a set of successful plan cases.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We presented two novel approaches for the problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">ML-CBP is a case-based approach that leverages the incomplete model and the plan cases to solve a new problem directly by affecting case-level transfer.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">RIM is a model-based approach that uses the incomplete model and the plan cases to first learn a more complete model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This model contains both primitive actions as well as macro-operators that are derived from the plan cases.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The learned model is then used in conjunction with an off-the-shelf planner to solve new problems.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We argued that both ML-CBP and RIM go beyond existing case-based planning approaches, and action model learning approaches.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We presented a comprehensive evaluation of the two approaches, both to characterize their relative tradeoffs, and to quantify their advances over existing approaches.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For the former, we focused on how the number of available cases and the degree of incompleteness of the input model affect the relative performance of ML-CBP and RIM.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For the latter, we compared ML-CBP to OAKPlan, an off-the-shelf state of the art case-based planner, and RIM to ARMS, an off-the-shelf action model learning system.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We believe that the insights from this work would be valuable to the planning community, given the increasing interest in supporting planning in scenarios where complete models are not available.</a>
