<a href="#0" id="0">The main contribution of this paper is the extension of Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions on Boolean algebras to the setting of distributive lattices and show that many intuitively appealing properties in the theory are transposed to this more general case.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We use this more general theory to provide a framework for reasoning about belief functions in a deductive approach on many non-classical formalisms in artificial intelligence which assume a setting of distributive lattices.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As an illustration of this deductive approach, we apply this general theory to a non-classical formalism in the foundations of Knowledge Representation the first-degree-entailment of relevance logic R.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This kind of integration of uncertainty measures such as belief functions and logics for knowledge representation is an important approach in reasoning under uncertain and imperfect knowledge in artificial intelligence [43].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Logics including many non-classical logics play a central role in the task of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence [42].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">And each of these logics was intended for some particular focus.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">On the other hand, uncertainty measures are usually to deal with uncertainty in information [31].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, non-classical logics are not expressive enough to express uncertainty in a gradual way and uncertainty measures such as belief functions are not enough to handling imperfect information.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is another motivation to combine uncertainty measures with non-classical logics in addition to that mentioned at the beginning of Section 4.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Bernard and Lang applied possibility theory to non-classical logics especially paraconsistent logics and showed how to reason under uncertain and inconsistent information [6].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Saffiotti proposed a formal framework to integrate logics for knowledge including first order logic and belief functions [49], [48], [50].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">But none of these papers has touched any issue about the mathematical foundation and computational complexity behind the theory of belief functions, just as we have done in this paper.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Here, we provide a sound and complete deductive system for reasoning about belief functions for a simple epistemic logic the first-degree-entailment fragment of relevance logic R through different duality theorems between algebraic semantics and logic.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This axiomatization can be used to show how to deduce one belief of some events from beliefs of others.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Moreover, we have given the complexity result of the satisfiability problem of belief formulas in this kind of non-classical settings.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The deductive approach for belief functions for first degree entailments can be applied to other non-classical formalisms {a mathematical formula}L that assume a setting of distributive lattices.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The axiomatization {a mathematical formula}BL for reasoning about belief functions on {a mathematical formula}L is simply obtained from the axiomatization {a mathematical formula}Bfde by replacing Part 1 of first degree entailments by {a mathematical formula}L and the implication {a mathematical formula}φ⊢Rfdeψ in Principle 3 (e) in Part 3 by {a mathematical formula}φ⊢Lψ.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In particular, our deductive approach also covers the formalism developed by Bernard and Lang in [6].</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In the literature, there are many similar kinds of integration of belief functions with other non-classical formalisms in Knowledge Representation.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In the theory of evidential reasoning on fuzzy events [68], [55], [56], [66], a belief functions is not defined in terms of mass assignments as in our paper but is defined to be a set function which is both monotonic and ∞-monotonic.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Moreover, it is defined indirectly either as an expectation of some membership function with respect to some other given belief function on the referential space [55], [56] or as a probability function through some generalized compatibility relation [66], [68].</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">In the theory of bipolar belief pairs on vague propositions [36], a belief function is defined indirectly as a probability function on some supervaluation pair and hence not in terms of mass assignments.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Usually it is difficult to do evidential reasoning with this kind of definitions without reference to mass assignments because Dempsterʼs rule of combination is defined in terms of them.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">In contrast, in the theory developed in this paper, we define belief functions in terms of mass assignment and moreover, characterize them without reference to mass assignments.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">So, our theory of belief functions on distributive lattices provides both a more transparent framework and a uniform foundation to do evidential reasoning in the above settings.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">This paper is a theoretical framework for our ongoing project to apply belief functions to multi-valued reasoning in AI [25], decision-making with bipolar information [14] and adding belief annotations to databases [24] with incomplete and/or inconsistent knowledge where structures of interest are usually assumed to be no more Boolean but distributive.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Our immediate task is to investigate information fusion in belief functions for distributive bilattice reasoning[25].</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The perspective of this paper mainly views belief functions as generalized probability functions.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Now we are also working on another different perspective regarding belief functions for evidence and are doing evidential reasoning for non-classical formalisms.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">A further project, which is probably more of theoretical interest, is to develop a theory of belief functions for quantum structures (not necessarily distributive) which would relate quantum computation and AI [67].</a>
