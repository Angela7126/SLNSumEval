<a href="#0" id="0">The computation of aspects, i.e., connected components of nonsingular configurations, is a critical task in the design and analysis of parallel robots.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proposed algorithm uses numerical constraint programming to fully certify this computation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is worth noting that this is the first algorithm that automatically handles such a large class of kinematic models with fully certifying the configurations existence, non-singularity and connectivity: The only restriction of the algorithm is its computational complexity, which is exponential with respect to the number of degrees of freedom of the robot.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The presented experiments have reported the sharp approximations of aspects for some realistic models: Large connected sets of nonsingular configurations, particularly suitable for path planning, have been computed for well-known planar robots with two and three degrees of freedom, the number of which matches the exact number of aspects.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The more challenging 3-RRR planar parallel robot, whose number of aspects is still an open question, remains out of reach because of the complexity of the computation, though we have obtained some promising results for a given orientation of its moving-platform.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Tackling this robot, as well as more complex and spatial ones, will certainly require the definition of stronger, dedicated, operators, and probably a change of computing paradigm, e.g., using parallelepipeds [42] instead of boxes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, although experiments have shown that the proposed method computes approximations of all aspects of well-known robots, it cannot be used for rigorously counting the aspects, a challenge we will address in the future on the basis of this method.</a>
