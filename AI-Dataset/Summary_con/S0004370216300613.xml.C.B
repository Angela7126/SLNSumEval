<a href="#0" id="0">We have shown how to develop robust NERC systems across languages and datasets with minimal human intervention, even for languages with inflected named entities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is based on adequately combining word representation features on top of shallow and general local features.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Crucially, we have empirically demonstrate how to effectively combine various types of simple word representation features depending on the source data available.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This has resulted in a clear methodology for using the three types of clustering features which produces very competitive results in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, despite the relative simplicity of our approach, we report state of the art results for Dutch, English, German, Spanish and Basque in seven in-domain evaluations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also outperform previous work in eight out-of-domain evaluations, showing that our clustering features improve the robustness of NERC systems across datasets.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, we have measured how much our system's performance degrades when the amount of supervised data is drastically cut.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The results show our models are still very competitive even when reducing the supervised data by half or more.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This, together with the lack of linguistic features, facilitates the easy and fast development of NERC systems for new domains or languages.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In future work we would like to explore more the various types of domain adaptation required for robust performance across text genres and domains, perhaps including micro-blog and noisy text such as tweets.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Furthermore, we are also planning to adapt our techniques to other sequence labeling problems such as Opinion Target Extraction [50], [49] and Super Sense tagging [14].</a>
