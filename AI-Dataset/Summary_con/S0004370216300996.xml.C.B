<a href="#0" id="0">We have analyzed the problems that arise in applications that require the interactive resolution of a constraint problem by a human user.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The central notion is global inverse consistency of the network because it ensures that the person who interactively solves the problem is not given the choice to select values that do not lead to solutions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have shown that deciding, computing, or restoring global inverse consistency, and other related problems are all NP-hard.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have proposed several algorithms for enforcing/maintaining/restoring global inverse consistency and we have shown that the best version is efficient enough to be used in an interactive setting on several configuration and design problems.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is a great advantage compared to existing techniques usually used in configurators.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As opposed to techniques maintaining arc consistency, our algorithms give an exact picture of the values remaining feasible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As opposed to compiling offline the problem as a multi-valued decision diagram, our algorithms can deal with constraint networks that change over time (e.g., an extra non-unary constraint posted by a customer who does not want to buy a car with more than 100,000 miles except if it is a Volvo).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">One direct perspective of this work is to try computing diverse solutions when enforcing GIC.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This should allow, on average, to reduce the number of search runs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Techniques such as those developed in [25] might be useful.</a>
