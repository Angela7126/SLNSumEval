<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we proposed a general framework for learning Bayesian network parameters under equivalence constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These constraints assert that the values of unobserved variables in certain examples of a dataset must be the same, even if that particular value is not known.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We proposed a notion of a constrained dataset, and a corresponding constrained log likelihood.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We proposed a fixed-point iterative algorithm for optimizing the constrained log likelihood, and showed empirically that it can be effective at learning more accurate models given more background knowledge in the form of equivalence constraints.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We further highlighted how our framework naturally models tasks in a variety of domains, where often domain-specific and (sometimes) less principled approaches have been previously proposed.</a>
