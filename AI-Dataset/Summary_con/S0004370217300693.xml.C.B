<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we have first studied the core-guided algorithms Eva and OLL, that inspired the best performing solvers on industrial instances at MSE-2014.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have demonstrated that the transformation applied by Eva at each iteration using the MaxSAT resolution rule corresponds to the introduction of a Cardinality constraint.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have described an alternative transformation applicable to Eva and, after analyzing the connections with OLL, we have concluded that both algorithms are in fact very similar.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">After analyzing Eva and OLL, we have also developed our new complete algorithm WPM3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The design of the algorithm allows us to combine several techniques to use only Cardinality constraints and perform the optimization of subproblems efficiently.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have also shown how these Cardinality constraints can be efficiently built by exploiting the structure of unsatisfiable cores in the MaxSAT instances.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">On the other hand, the optimization of subproblems allows the algorithm, not only to converge more quickly to the optimum, but also to get assignments and upper bounds, being able to work as an incomplete approach given limited time.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We have further exploited these assignments to extend effectively the notion of phase saving to MaxSAT.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, we have conducted an extensive experimental investigation on industrial instances, showing the impact of every technique.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We have pointed out the importance of exploiting the structure of unsatisfiable cores to build the Cardinality constraints.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In fact, we have shown that the improvement on the performance is mostly due to this exploitation and not only to building the Cardinality constraints incrementally.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To evaluate independently WPM3, we have submitted it both to the complete and incomplete track of the MSE-2015, winning several categories and subcategories.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">At the complete track, it got a gold and a bronze medals on PMS and MS industrial subcategories respectively.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">At the incomplete track, it dominated on industrial instances getting medals in all industrial subcategories, two golds on WPMS and PMS and a silver on MS.</a>
