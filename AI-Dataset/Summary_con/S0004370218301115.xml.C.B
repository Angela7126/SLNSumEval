<a href="#0" id="0">Standard contraction operators are always successful, i.e. they are such that the result of contracting a (non-tautological) belief from a given belief base is a new belief base which (is contained in the original one and) does not imply that belief.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, as discussed before, this is not a realistic feature of belief contraction.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An agent may have a set of beliefs (not necessarily tautologies) that he/she is not willing to give up independently of the contraction to be performed.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The basic idea of shielded contraction is to define a function in two steps.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first step consists of determining which beliefs are suitable to be contracted and which are not, i.e. given a belief, first it is analysed if it belongs to the set of retractable sentences (set of beliefs suitable to be contracted) or not.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Afterwards the function should:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">leave the set of beliefs unchanged when the belief to be contracted is considered irretractable; behave as a standard contraction when contracting by a retractable belief.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This kind of operators is useful for modelling the behaviour of a rational agent when it receives some new information that forces the disbelief in one of its current beliefs.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In a context where the belief states of an agent are represented by belief bases, a shielded base contraction can be used to obtain the new belief state of the agent, after such an information is received.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We notice that by means of this kind of operators it is possible to obtain more realistic models than those that can be obtained using (only) standard contractions, since it is naturally expectable that a rational agent will not always be willing to give up any of its present beliefs even if some external new information compels it to do so.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The present paper constitutes a thorough study of shielded contractions on belief bases.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In Section 3 we presented several results highlighting some direct relations among the postulates satisfied by a shielded contraction function ∼ induced by a standard contraction ÷ and a set of retractable sentences R and the postulates satisfied by ÷ and the properties of the set R. From the conclusions that can be drawn from those results we highlight the two following ones, concerning the postulates of relative success and persistence:</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The shielded base contraction ∼ satisfies relative success if and only if ÷ satisfies failure or the set R satisfies non-retractability of tautology.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">If R and ÷ satisfy condition (R ÷) then ∼ satisfies persistence.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Furthermore if {a mathematical formula}R={α:A∼α⊬α} and ∼ satisfies persistence then R and ÷ satisfy condition (R ÷).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We are giving special attention here to the postulates of relative success and persistence since these two postulates can be considered to be the most characteristic (and intuitive) properties of shielded contraction (together with inclusion).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">On the one hand relative success can be thought of as the most natural weakened version of the success postulate that complies with the idea underlying the notion of shielded contraction.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">On the other hand, among the postulates here considered to characterize shielded contractions, persistence can be seen as the one that more accurately describes the behaviour that is expected from a shielded contraction.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In this paper we have considered that a reasonable shielded contraction operator should satisfy at least the postulates of inclusion and relative success, and we presented a representation theorem—which is essentially based on the result mentioned in (i) above—for the class of (shielded contraction) operators that satisfy exactly those two postulates.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In what concerns persistence, according to (ii) above, in order to assure that the shielded contraction, that is built from a contraction ÷ and a set R, satisfies that postulate, it is enough to impose that R and ÷ satisfy condition (R ÷).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Sections 4 and 5 contain the other contributions of this paper, namely the proposal and axiomatic characterization of twenty kinds of shielded contractions and the study of the interrelations among all those classes in terms of inclusion.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">All the shielded contractions considered are defined by means of a base contraction function (of some well known class of such operators) and a certain set R formed by the so-called retractable sentences.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Among these classes there are four which are formed by shielded contraction operators that satisfy the above highlighted postulate of persistence.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">By means of the provided results it is possible to predict the behaviour of any of the functions constructed as indicated in each of the definitions presented.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">On the other hand, it is also possible to use these results in the converse direction, that is, for certain sets of properties that are desirable from a shielded contraction function, our results allow to identify an explicit construction of a function that will satisfy all the properties included in that set.</a>
