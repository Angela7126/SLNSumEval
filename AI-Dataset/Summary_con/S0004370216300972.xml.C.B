<a href="#0" id="0">We have studied how to propagate pairs of Sum constraints that respect a discrete convexity condition.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From this condition, we have derived a parametric propagator, which can be instantiated to be competitive with previously published propagators, often matching their time complexity, despite its generality.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There are a number of open questions we plan to address in the future.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Can we automatically generate the instantiation of the parameters from the definitions of the {a mathematical formula}fi and {a mathematical formula}gi?</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Can we make an incremental propagator that has a better time complexity along a branch of the search tree?</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Can we extend the approach to functions that take more than one argument, say {a mathematical formula}fi(xi,yi) for variables {a mathematical formula}yi distinct from each other, or {a mathematical formula}fi(xi,y) for a shared variable y, covering for instance the variable-average version of Spread[2], [26]?</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Can we deal with more than two sum constraints in one propagator?</a>
