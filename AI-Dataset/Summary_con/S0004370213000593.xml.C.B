<a href="#0" id="0">While in their original paper, Dung et al. [21] have proposed their approach of ideal sets and extensions as a dedicated semantics for abstract argumentation frameworks (being in the line with the logic programming semantics [1] which motivated their work), we believe that the idea behind ideal semantics is more in the spirit of an alternative, third, notion of acceptance besides credulous and skeptical acceptance.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A view which is backed up by the recent introduction of eager semantics [13] which are defined as ideal semantics but replacing preferred by semi-stable extensions as a basis.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In fact, in this paper we analysed common properties for different formings of ideal semantics and we investigated the instantiation w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">semi-stable, stage, naive, and resolution-based grounded semantics in detail.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our complexity analysis showed that ideal reasoning in these instantiations is of the same complexity as skeptical reasoning, which is in contrast to the standard ideal semantics, where reasoning is known to be in {a mathematical formula}Θ2P[25] and thus easier than the {a mathematical formula}Π2P-hard problem of skeptical reasoning (for preferred semantics); see also Table 2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We identified as a main reason for this result the fact that credulous reasoning in preferred semantics is only in NP, while for the semantics we have considered here, credulous acceptance is on the same level of complexity as skeptical reasoning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We therefore also provided two different generic algorithms for computing the ideal extension, one based on the credulous acceptance problem the other based on the skeptical acceptance problem of the base semantics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The fact that ideal reasoning is as hard as skeptical reasoning seems to be the more common situation as also results in other non-monotonic settings shows.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For instance, the concept of prudent reasoning from default theories is (as skeptical default reasoning) {a mathematical formula}Π2P-complete [11].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As well, deciding for free consequences (i.e. formulas entailed by the intersection of all maximal consistent subsets of a (potentially inconsistent) knowledge base [9]) is a {a mathematical formula}Π2P-complete problem [14] and also in nature similar to ideal reasoning.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Finally, we note that the view promoted in our treatment of ideal reasoning is by no means limited to semantics in Dungʼs AFs but, as discussed in Section 7 can also be considered with respect to such developments as value-based frameworks [6].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In this case we have shown that characterisation properties and complexity bounds are similar features to those we have shown to hold in standard AFs.</a>
