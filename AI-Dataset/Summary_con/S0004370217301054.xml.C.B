<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we have presented a systematic account of Distributed First Order Logic (DFOL) and we have shown how the notions of domain relation, arrow variable and bridge rule enable the characterisation of a wide range of semantic relationships between different KBs belonging to a distributed knowledge base systems modelled by means of (subsets of) first-order logics, each KB having its own domain of interpretation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, we have defined a sound and complete calculus which characterises the notion of DFOL logical consequence, and we have illustrated how to use it to infer logical relations between distributed knowledge.</a>
