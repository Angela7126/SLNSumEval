<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we analyzed the complexity of finding a feasible matching for a given matching problem with regional quotas.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We showed that, when we put no restrictions on the structure of regions, checking the existence of a feasible matching that satisfies all quotas is NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, assuming that regions have a hierarchical structure, we developed strategyproof matching mechanisms for handling regional minimum/maximum quotas called PLDA-RQ and RSDA-RQ.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We proved that these mechanisms are fair but wasteful, while they satisfy conditions that are weaker than nonwastefulness (i.e., PL-wastefulness and school-equitable-nonwastefulness).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, PLDA-RQ satisfies a stronger fairness requirement called PL-fairness, and it obtains the student-optimal PL-fair and PL-nonwasteful matching.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We then confirmed the advantages of these mechanisms compared to the artificial cap mechanism via simulations.</a>
