<a href="#0" id="0">The aim of this paper was to shed more light into the applicability of well-known results from the belief change literature into logics that were not in their original scope (i.e., non-classical logics).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our work is motivated by the fact that the problem of evolution is ubiquitous in all forms of knowledge, and several modern knowledge representation formalisms, such as logics used in the Semantic Web (DLs, OWL, RDF/S), logics used in rule-based systems and applications (Horn logic), or logics used to reason about various computational phenomena (intuitionistic logic) are not classical.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Being able to exploit the rich belief change literature would greatly aid research efforts addressing the problem of evolution in such formalisms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our work focused on the contraction operator, and, in particular, on three different characterizations of contraction operators.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first was proposed by the AGM trio [3], and characterized contraction through a set of postulates, the AGM postulates, that included the debated postulate of recovery [9], [10], [11].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The second characterization proposed the replacement of recovery in the AGM postulates with the postulate of relevance[11].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The third characterization was actually a constructive way to define contraction operators (called partial meet contraction [3]).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In classical logics, it can be shown that all three characterizations are equivalent, in the sense that they allow the definition of the same contraction operators; however, this is not true for non-classical logics.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Moreover, there are non-classical logics where the proposed postulates fail altogether, i.e., there are logics where one cannot define neither an AGM-compliant contraction operator nor a relevance-compliant contraction operator.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We addressed these problems by studying different useful classes of (non-classical) logics and formulating sufficient conditions for the applicability of the two different sets of postulates in such logics; in addition, we gave sufficient conditions for the different characterizations to be equivalent, and proved some negative results using counter-examples.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The most important of our results are summarized in Fig. 1 and Table 2.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Note that the results for classical logics that appear in the belief change literature are corollaries of our more general results.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For practical purposes, our main conclusion is that relevance has wider applicability in practically useful representation formalisms.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To support this conclusion, we listed several practically useful representation formalisms where we can apply the AGM-relevance postulates but not the AGM postulates (see Table 3).</a>
