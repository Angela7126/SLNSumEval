<a href="#0" id="0">This paper has introduced a novel semi-structured formalism for argumentation, based on a few essential concepts and properties, complemented by a notion of appropriate set based argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proposed approach turns out to be useful for modeling, analyzing, and, possibly, revising structured argumentation formalisms as demonstrated in the paper for the cases of Vreeswijk's AAS and Modgil and Prakken's {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given the foundational nature of this work we believe it may play a role in the development of several long-term investigation directions, in addition to the future work lines already mentioned in Section 10.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For instance, while computational issues cannot be addressed at a level where the language and the argument construction are not specified, investigating the computational properties and efficient implementation strategies for actual instances of the proposed approach appears to be a very important and interesting subject.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To exemplify some of the relevant matters, consider the notion of extended contrariness in the revisited version of {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A straightforward implementation approach would involve deriving the whole extended contrariness relation from the original contrariness relation and the set of strict rules, which may be burdensome but can be done once and for all, separately from the argument construction process.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Another option would be to avoid this sort of preprocessing and combine on the fly the argument construction process with the discovery of the elements of the extended contrariness relation which are actually needed in the case at hand.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Locality considerations and incremental algorithms might be useful to improve efficiency in this perspective (see e.g. [41], [42], [43]).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Another direction of investigation concerns extending the application of the proposed approach to argumentation systems dealing with dynamic aspects, like, for instance, Extended Temporal Argumentation Frameworks [44], [45] or systems integrating belief revision and argumentation [46].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we note that while appropriate argumentation frameworks are able to provide proper justification functions for LAF-ensembles, LAF-ensembles are not bound, per se to the use of argumentation frameworks and other justification assessment mechanisms, possibly not based on Dung's formalism, could also be considered.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this sense, it seems interesting to explore the use of LAF-ensembles as a basic modeling tool for any context where fallible and infallible reasoning need to be combined, even beyond argumentation-based approaches.</a>
