<a href="#0" id="0">As a critical tool for understanding complex non-occurring behaviors, NSP presents interesting information about NOB dynamics and patterns.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">mining NSP is very challenging due to the complexities surrounding non-occurring items, high computational cost, and the large search space of negative candidates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, NSP discovery is becoming increasingly important for many intelligent systems and applications, as traditional PSP and association rule mining approaches cannot effectively detect such patterns and exceptions that are associated with non-occurring sequences.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the very limited research outcomes reported on NSP mining, existing techniques rely heavily on re-scanning databases after identifying positive patterns and incorporate specific designs and definitions for respective purposes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This has been shown to be highly inefficient and inapplicable for real-life large data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this paper, we have proposed an innovative framework, set theory-based NSP mining, and an instantiated algorithm e-NSP, which are built on a solid theoretical foundation including a comprehensive design of constraints, negative containment, negative conversion, NSC generation, and NSC support calculation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Both theoretical and experimental analyses have been provided for e-NSP on computational complexities, data characteristics in terms of data factors, and scalability on nine distinct datasets, compared with two typical benchmark NSP mining algorithms.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Experimental results are consistent with the theoretical analyses, concluding that e-NSP is much more efficient than existing approaches.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">e-NSP has been shown to perform particularly well on datasets with a small number of elements in a sequence, a large number of itemsets and under low minimum supports.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">e-NSP offers a new strategy for efficiently mining large scale NSP.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We are currently working on effective approaches to select the most meaningful patterns from PSP and NSP, and on more effective data structures that can store less data but can support the easy calculation of union sets for efficient NSP mining on large scale data.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Further efforts will be made in the exploration of the critical challenges discussed in Section 7, including data characteristics, constraints and scalability.</a>
