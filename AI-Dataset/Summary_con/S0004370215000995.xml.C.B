<a href="#0" id="0">Many-objective optimization poses great challenges for EAs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The ineffectiveness of the Pareto dominance relation in a high-dimensional space suggests the need for new methodologies.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This paper presents a meta-objective optimization approach, called BiGE, to deal with many-objective problems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Converting many objectives of a given problem into two objectives of proximity and crowding degree, BiGE creates an optimization problem in which the objectives are the goals of the search process itself.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Systematic experiments have been carried out by providing extensive comparative studies between BiGE and five state-of-the-art algorithms on four groups of well-defined continuous and combinatorial benchmark suites with 5, 10, and 15 objectives.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Unlike some peer algorithms, which work well on only a fraction of the test problems (e.g., AGE-II and MOEA/D on the 5-objective instances, HypE and NSGA-III on the continuous instances, and FD-NSGA-II on the combinatorial instances), BiGE can achieve a good balance between solutions' proximity and diversity on the test problems with different properties.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In addition, the effect of several parameters on the algorithm was investigated.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Experimental results have indicated the insensitiveness of BiGE to the population size and objective dimensionality and also the effectiveness of BiGE under different settings of the sharing discriminator within a certain range.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, a comparison with three AR-based algorithms has shown the advantage of the proposed framework and proximity estimation in dealing with many-objective problems.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Bi-goal evolution of proximity and diversity is a new concept in evolutionary multi-objective optimization.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It performs the key decision process of mating and environmental selection in a two-lay process, with the lower level being a sort of recursive call to multi-objective optimization.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This two-layer decision structure may open up many possibilities for hybridizations in the future, for example, instantiated by different comparison strategies in the selection process.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Despite high competitiveness of BiGE shown in our first attempt, more work is needed to further investigate its benefits and limitations in the future.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In this regard, applying BiGE to more real-world problems and developing (or introducing) other proximity and crowding degree estimation methods are two focuses of our subsequent study.</a>
