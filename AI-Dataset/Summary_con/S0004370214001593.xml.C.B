<a href="#0" id="0">We studied POMDPs with limit-average objectives under probabilistic semantics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since for general probabilistic semantics, the problems are undecidable even for PFA, we focus on the very important special case of almost-sure winning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For almost-sure winning with a qualitative constraint, we show that belief-support-based strategies are not sufficient for finite-memory strategies, and establish EXPTIME-complete complexity for the existence of finite-memory strategies.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given our decidability result, the next natural questions are whether the result can be extended to infinite-memory strategies, or to quantitative path constraints.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that both these problems are undecidable, and thus establish the precise decidability frontier with tight complexity bounds.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Also observe that contrary to other classical results for POMDPs where both the finite-memory and infinite-memory problems are undecidable, for almost-sure winning with a qualitative constraint, we show that the finite-memory problem is decidable (EXPTIME-complete), but the infinite-memory problem is undecidable.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also present a prototype implementation of our EXPTIME-complete algorithm along with a heuristic, and the implementation works reasonably efficiently on example POMDPs from the literature.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">An interesting direction of future work would be to consider discounted reward payoff instead of limit-average payoff.</a>
