<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we have presented the basic architecture for acquiring constraint networks from examples classified by the user.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have formally defined the main constraint acquisition problems related to passive and active acquisition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have closed several central complexity results that were still open.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For instance, we have shown that consistency of the version space is polynomial to decide whereas convergence is intractable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have also shown that constraint networks are not learnable in general with a polynomial number of membership queries.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have then proposed Conacq, a system for acquiring constraint networks that uses a clausal representation of the version space.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Conacq is presented in a passive version (Conacq.1), where the learner is only provided a pool of examples, and an active version (Conacq.2), where the learner asks membership queries to the user.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The clausal representation of the version space allows Conacq to perform operations on the version space efficiently.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For instance, the clausal representation is used to implement query generation strategies in active acquisition.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we have compared experimentally the passive and active versions of Conacq on a set of toy problems.</a>
