<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we have capitalised on the advances made into the study of mixed equilibria in Boolean games in [8] by strengthening, expanding and, hopefully, simplifying the proof techniques used.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While this does not exactly allow us to obtain results “for free”, it does provide us with a tool kit and a strategy, whereas before we had but wishful thinking.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In an upcoming paper we demonstrate how these techniques can be used to obtain highly non-trivial results with apparent ease, and to translate proofs from other frameworks into the language of Boolean games.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">What this paper does not provide is any way to deal with function and search problems—notably FindNash, the problem of actually computing an equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While it is possible that the coding machinery introduced here will be helpful in addressing this challenge, it certainly does not offer any trivial way to translate the existing arguments in game theory.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This question should be of interest even to researchers outside of the Boolean games community as it will concern function problems in superpolynomial time—a class rarely studied and little understood.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This is clearly an avenue that bears further enquiry.</a>
