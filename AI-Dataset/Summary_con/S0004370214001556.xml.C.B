<a href="#0" id="0">We have provided the first foundational account of epistemic reasoning in the situation calculus in asynchronous multi-agent domains.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A principled axiomatisation of the observability of actions is used to explicitly define an agent's knowledge in terms of its local view.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By reifying observations and views as terms in the logic, we are able to give a succinct definition of the dynamics of the knowledge fluent and prove that its behaviour matches our intuitive expectations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The standard account of knowledge requires that domains be synchronous, so that the Knows operator need not consider arbitrarily-long sequences of hidden actions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Handling hidden actions requires a second-order induction axiom to universally quantify over situation terms, precluding the use of regression for effective automated reasoning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have shown that this second-order axiom can be factored out of the regression rules, and replaced with a fixpoint calculation performed by the meta-level reasoning machinery.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This fixpoint calculation requires theorem proving based on a very restricted set of axioms, offering a significant advantage over generic second-order theorem proving.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Several decidable classes and tractable techniques can be realised as special cases of this generic result.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We have demonstrated that our account of knowledge is expressive enough to capture the standard account of knowledge based on public actions, as well as more complex formulations where the observability of actions depends on the state of the world.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Moreover, it maintains its important theorems and the availability of a regression rule as more complex kinds of information-producing action are introduced.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have shown that a simple modification to regression rules allows a situated agent to reason directly about its own knowledge using only its local view, rather than constructing a query that universally quantifies over all situations compatible with its view.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Our new observation-based semantics thus provides a powerful account of knowledge suitable both for reasoning about, and for reasoning in, asynchronous multi-agent domains.</a>
