<a href="#0" id="0">In this article, we presented analysis and performance measure of RoboCup@Home competition over time.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We also described a set of notable techniques that have been developed and integrated in the robotic systems that have participated to the competitions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As discussed, a careful design of the scoring system allowed us not only to rank the teams in the competition but also to analyze the general performance of the teams.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is useful to drive the competitions over the years by balancing the use of different functionalities and by progressively increasing the task difficulty.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In general, the presented approach allows some desired functionalities to be related with a set of tasks in which these functionalities are combined.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When tasks evolve, the approach enables the analysis of the results over time, and these results are useful for decisions about modifying such tasks.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We believe that this approach, which has successfully improved the RoboCup@Home competition, can be adopted by other scientific competitions or even in the evaluation of a research program that continues to operate for many years, when functionalities and tasks are properly associated.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Although the results obtained so far have been very satisfactory, future developments must be addressed.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">One direction is refining the scoring system toward a deeper analysis of the contribution of the task functionalities.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This can be done by requiring the teams involved in a test to provide information about their internal states, e.g., by a logging utility.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Better ways of measuring the task complexity/difficulty at design time must also be studied to improve analysis.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Another direction is to increase benchmarking efforts so that scientific competitions can actually provide an effective way of benchmarking systems that integrate Artificial Intelligence and Robotics techniques.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this respect, acquiring additional data sets and better exploitation of the competition field for benchmarking purposes is planned for future competitions.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Finally, we intend to increase our focus on testing the cognitive abilities of the robots.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The idea of a GPSR test with robots that can reason about the world and their actions to complete tasks that are not specified beforehand will be further exploited in other tests or phases of tests.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We believe that a deep analysis of the results of scientific competitions and goal-driven management of yearly changes will improve the development of more innovative systems as well as the research quality of the solutions developed by the participating teams.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Although the RoboCup@Home approach presented here may be improved in many directions, we consider it an important step towards a more scientific management and evaluation of evolving competitions.</a>
