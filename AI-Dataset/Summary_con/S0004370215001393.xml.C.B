<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, an extended variant of query learning is considered where a hidden concept is located in a black box in some partial circuit.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We characterized the solution space and the complexity of the solvability question for the specification problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Restricting the domain of possible solutions allows us to construct concrete solutions using ideas from query learning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It may be interesting future work to weaken the restriction to domains that are closed under conjunction and/or disjunction or to expand the domains in other ways.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When returning solutions explicitly, the size of its representation is important.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, it may also be interesting future work to combine the techniques of [7], [5] for deciding solvability with our approaches to compact solution representations using nested Boolean functions as models for quantified Boolean formulas [4].</a>
