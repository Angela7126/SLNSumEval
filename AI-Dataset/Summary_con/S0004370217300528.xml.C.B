<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we develop two strategy-proof mechanisms, TTCR-SS and PLDA-MQ, for a school choice program where the obtained matching must respect minimum quotas and initial endowments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">TTCR-SS is Pareto efficient, while PLDA-MQ is PL-stable and obtains the student-optimal matching within all PL-stable matchings.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our simulation results show that our new mechanisms significantly outperform simple extensions of existing mechanisms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our immediate future work will extend our mechanisms to handle different types of distributional constraints besides minimum quotas [27].</a>
