<a href="#0" id="0">In this article, we have presented a simple yet empirically highly effective framework of training discriminative models.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The main idea is to reduce the sparseness of features by frequency bucketing over large-scale automatically processed data, and defining meta features from the resulting feature clusters.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When applied to dependency parsing and part-of-speech tagging, the proposed approach significantly improves the accuracies.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the dependency parsing task, the meta parser achieves comparable accuracy with the best known parsers on the English data and the best accuracy on the Chinese data so far.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the part-of-speech tagging task, our tagger provided better results than the state-of-the-art Baseline systems by about 5% error reduction when tested on both English and Chinese data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Further analysis indicate that the meta features are very effective in processing the unknown features.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For future work, there are several ways in which this research could be extended.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First, we plan to experiment with alternative clustering algorithms for feature transformation in the current tasks.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Second, we plan to use larger raw data to perform feature transformation.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Third, we plan to combine other semi-supervised methods, such as the approach of [44], with ours to enhance our parsers.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Finally, we could apply the framework to other NLP tasks (for example constituency parsing and NER).</a>
