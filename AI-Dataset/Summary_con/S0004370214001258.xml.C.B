<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we proposed Most Frugal Explanation (MFE) as a tractable heuristic alternative to (approximate) MAP for deciding upon the best explanation in Bayesian networks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While the MFE problem is intractable in general—its decision variant is {a mathematical formula}NPPPPP-complete, and thus even harder than the {a mathematical formula}NPPP-complete MAP problem [51], the {a mathematical formula}PPPP-complete Same-Decision Probability problem [9], or the {a mathematical formula}PPPPP-complete k-th MAP problem [41]—it can be tractably approximated under situational constraints that are arguably more realistic in large real-world applications than the constraints that are needed to render MAP (fixed-parameter) tractable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Notably, the {a mathematical formula}{c,tw,1−p}-fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for MAP [4] has a running time with {a mathematical formula}log⁡plog⁡1−p in the exponent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the random networks used in the simulations, the average probability of the most probable explanation was 0.0245, which would yield an unpractical exponent of {a mathematical formula}log⁡0.0245log⁡0.9755≈150.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In contrast, even when only half of the total set of intermediate variables are considered as relevant, for an arbitrary sample over the rest of the intermediate variables we will find the MFE in about 40% of the cases, and an explanation that is one of the five best in about 60% of the cases.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In future work we wish to investigate the possible explanatory power of MFE in cognitive science.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In recent years it has been proposed that human cognizers make decisions using (Bayesian) sampling [31], [57], [62] and approximate Bayesian inferences using exemplars [54]; studies show that we have a hard time solving problems with many relevant aspects [20].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The parameterized complexity results of the MFE framework may theoretically explain why such approaches work fine in practice and under what conditions the limits of our cognitive capacities are reached.</a>
