<a href="#0" id="0">We have shown that the unbiased black-box model allows for algorithms which solve the optimization version of the {a mathematical formula}NP-hard partition problem in a polynomial number of queries, even if the arity of the algorithms is restricted to one.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our result indicates that the unbiased black-box model, while clearly closer to the truth than the unrestricted one, still does not provide a complete picture on how difficult it is to solve a given problem via randomized search heuristics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It seems that further restrictions to the power of the algorithms are needed to obtain meaningful results.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A recent step into this direction is the work by the first two authors [14], who, following a suggestion by Nikolaus Hansen, investigate a black-box model where the algorithm can only compare the quality of solutions, but has no access to the absolute function values.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We do not know yet the black-box complexity of, e.g., Partition in this new model.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We should note, though, that observing smaller-than-expected black-box complexities does not always reveal a weakness of the black-box complexity model regarded.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In [7], the authors exhibit the first {a mathematical formula}O(nlog⁡n) crossover-based (unbiased) evolutionary algorithm for the OneMax function class, which shows that the {a mathematical formula}O(nlog⁡n) bound for the 2-ary unbiased black-box complexity of OneMax found in [8] is not as unnatural as it might have seemed at first.</a>
