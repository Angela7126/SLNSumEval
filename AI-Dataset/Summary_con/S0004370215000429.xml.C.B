<a href="#0" id="0">We have demonstrated that SAT-based methods can be used to tackle the longstanding mathematical questions related to discrepancy of ±1 sequences.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of automatically generated unsatisfiability certificates as formal proofs of non-trivial mathematical statements.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a result, we able to identify the exact boundary between satisfiability and unsatisfiability for the encoding of the EDP for {a mathematical formula}C=2, thus identifying the longest sequences of discrepancy 2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have established the surprising fact that the lengths of the longest multiplicative and completely multiplicative sequences of discrepancy 3 coincide.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The latter result helps to establish a novel lower bound on the length of the longest discrepancy 3 sequence.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The general question of the existence of a finite bound on the length of ±1 sequences of discrepancy 3 (that is, the Erdős conjecture for {a mathematical formula}C=3) remains open.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Considering the tenfold gap between the sizes of unrestricted discrepancy 3 sequences that solvers can find and maximal (completely) multiplicative discrepancy 3 sequences it would seem that without fresh ideas the conjecture is unlikely to be settled by a brute-force analysis, even helped by the modern SAT solver technology.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">There is a noticeable asymmetry in our findings.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The fact that a sequence of length 1160 has discrepancy 2 can be relatively easily checked manually.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It is harder but not impossible to verify the correctness of the discrepancy bound for {a mathematical formula}127645-long sequences.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">On the other hand, even though improvements to our method shortened the Wikipedia-size 13 GB proof reported in [30] more than tenfold, passing the psychological barrier of 1 GB, it still probably is one of the longest proofs of a non-trivial mathematical result.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">It is equally improbable that a mathematician would verify by hand ten billion or half a billion of automatically generated proof lines.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Having said that, the reduction of proof size will be useful for any future analysis in an attempt to identify patterns and lemmas and produce a compact proof more amenable for human comprehension.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Until such a human-comprehensible proof is found, the epistemic status of our results remains rather peculiar: we know that a proof exists, we even have it, we can handle it, check it by a third-party tool, analyse it, transform it, but we cannot understand it.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">To what extent this proof can be recognised as a proof is then a subject of foundational debate on the future of computer mathematics and goes beyond the scope of this article.</a>
