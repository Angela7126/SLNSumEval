<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we introduced arbitrary arrow update logic where one can quantify over arrow updates.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We investigated its expressivity relative to other logics in the family of dynamic epistemic logics, including epistemic logic with common knowledge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For a finite set of agents and a countably infinite set of propositional variables we managed to completely chart the expressivity landscape over the class of all Kripke models.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For one agent and countably many propositional variable we also completely charted the landscape, mostly because in S5 all related systems boil down to epistemic logic.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For two agents and one propositional variable, there is only one question remaining and that is one half of the relative expressivity of APAL and AAUL, and we conjecture that the logics have non-comparable expressivity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also showed that the model checking problem for arbitrary arrow update logic is PSPACE-complete, and we introduced a sound and complete infinitary axiomatization for arbitrary arrow update logic.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As far as future research is concerned there are other arbitrary variants of dynamic modal logics to consider and investigate their relative expressivity to AAUL, moreover we can further develop variants of APAL present in the literature and investigate what happens if we replace public announcements by arrow updates.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Another interesting question for future research is whether we can characterize for which dynamic operators “arbitrary version” are incomparable in expressivity.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As mentioned in Section 4.3, we would generally expect any two logics using different “arbitrary operators” to be incomparable in expressivity.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Yet the logics RML and AAML turn out to be only as expressive as basic epistemic logic, and therefore less expressive than the logics APAL and AAUL.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It would be interesting to know exactly why RML and AAML deviate from the expected pattern.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Finally, we could add more temporal connectives to AAUL, and study their interaction with the {a mathematical formula}[↕] operator.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In particular, if we add CTL-connectives like AG and AE we could use AAUL (with the normative interpretation) to study concepts like liveness, fairness and safety.</a>
