<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we have studied convergence properties in stable matching and hedonic games with structural constraints, which generalize a variety of recently proposed models for visibility and agent externality.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our results are a tight axiomatic characterization for the existence of a path to stability of polynomial length in games with correlated preferences.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The set of consistency axioms are minimal in the sense that if an axiom is dropped or relaxed, a (polynomial) path to stability cannot be guaranteed.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, we have studied a model of local visibility in hedonic games based on the notion of formation graphs, and we provided a tight characterization of the existence of polynomial paths to stability based on the formation graphs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our upper bounds on the convergence time are polynomial in the number of agents n and the number of coalitions m. Our lower bound gadgets involve coalitions of constant size and show bounds that are exponential in n. As such, the dichotomy in our results is strongest if {a mathematical formula}mâˆˆpoly(n) as is the case, e.g., in the prominent case of matching.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">There are a variety of interesting problems that arise from our work.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A natural question is whether additional constraints that arise in matching or coalition formation problems can be formulated within our framework of consistent generation and domination rules.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, there are interesting additional variants of local coalition formation games, e.g., when each existing coalition forms an organization graph in the network (instead of a clique as in Section 4).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, beyond correlated preferences, efficient algorithms for the computation of stability concepts have recently been derived for several other classes of hedonic games [51], [52], [53], [54].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It would be interesting to see under which conditions one can also guarantee (polynomial) paths to stability (with and without additional structural constraints).</a>
