<a href="#0" id="0">Competitions of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers have been organized regularly since 2002 and they serve as the main tool for evaluating and comparing state-of-the-art SAT solvers.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We believe they also serve as one of the main motivators for researchers and developers to continually invent new algorithms and implementation techniques for SAT solving.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The aim of the 2015 SAT Race was to continue the tradition of SAT solving competitions and also to introduce new challenges.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The most significant novelty of the 2015 SAT Race is the Incremental Library Track (ILT).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For the ILT we have designed an API (called IPASIR) that makes it possible to develop SAT solving based applications without committing to any specific SAT solver.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We believe that this will prove to be very useful for SAT solver users and increase the already high number of systems which use SAT solvers as their reasoning engines.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We hope that the ILT Track will be continued in the following competitions and the IPASIR interface (or its extension) will get widely accepted and adopted by the SAT community.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this paper we provided an overview of the 2015 SAT Race.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We gave a detailed description of the new Incremental Track and the IPASIR interface.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We presented and analyzed the results of the competition and provided an overview of the winning solvers and the new techniques they use.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The solver similarity results indicated, that the solvers are very similar to each other.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This could be a negative side effect of SAT competitions and their benchmark selection methodology.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Future benchmark selection methods should be designed while keeping this in mind.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The ILT had only one benchmark submission.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since there are many more systems based on incremental SAT solving we assume that our call for benchmarks did not reach the developers.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Until the ILT becomes more traditional these developers should be contacted directly.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The evaluation criteria for the ILT were not clearly defined before the competition.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For future competitions we must design a fair and well defined evaluation mechanism and publish it in the call for participation.</a>
