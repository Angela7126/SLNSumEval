<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, the unique Evidential Reasoning (ER) rule was established, its inherent properties were explored in detail, and comprehensive numerical and simulation studies were conducted to facilitate its comparison with other existing evidence combination rules.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The ER rule reveals that the combined degree of joint support for a proposition from two pieces of independent evidence constitutes two parts in general: the bounded sum of their individual support and the orthogonal sum of their collective support.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The ER rule is based on the orthogonal sum operation and thus inherits the basic properties of being associative and commutative, so that it can be used to combine multiple pieces of evidence in any order without changing the final results.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It was proven that the ER rule satisfies four synthesis axioms that any rational probabilistic reasoning process should follow.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It was shown that the ER algorithm is a special case of the ER rule when the reliability of evidence is equal to its weight that is normalised to be relative to each other among all pieces of evidence.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It was proven that Dempsterʼs rule is a special case of the ER rule as well when each piece of evidence is fully reliable.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It was also shown that the ER rule completes and enhances Dempsterʼs rule by identifying how to combine multiple pieces of fully reliable evidence that are highly or completely conflicting through the reliability perturbation analysis proposed in this paper.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The ER rule advances D–S theory of evidence and the ER approach.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">On one hand, the Belief Distribution (BD) introduced in D–S theory was employed as a basis to profile a piece of evidence; on the other hand, the basic probability assignment method proposed in the ER approach was generalised to construct a novel Weighted Belief Distribution (WBD) and a WBD with Reliability (WBDR) for characterising evidence equivalently in complement of BD.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the process of constructing WBD (or WBDR), the specificity of evidence is kept intact.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It is the implementation of the orthogonal sum operation on WBDs (or WBDRs) that leads to the establishment of the ER rule.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As such, the ER rule constitutes a generic conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process, or a generalised Bayesian inference process, which is applicable to combine multiple pieces of independent evidence with different weights and reliabilities in a wide range of areas such as multiple criteria decision analysis [32], [34], [35] and information fusion [14].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The proposed reliability perturbation analysis is based on both the interpretation of conflict that if conflict between two information sources is high at least one of them may be unreliable, and the conjecture that if two pieces of evidence are in complete conflict the weighted average rule should be applied to combine their BDs.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The above conjecture is based on the observation that the conjunction of two pieces of evidence will be empty if they are completely conflicting, which is a special case of mutual exclusiveness.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">While it is widely accepted that the combination of two pieces of mutually exclusive evidence should be additive, the conjecture needs to be proven rigorously, which is beyond the scope of this paper and requires further research.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Nevertheless, the interpretation of conflict is well researched in literature, and the reliability perturbation analysis led to the completion and enhancement of Dempsterʼs rule by exploring doubt over reliability rather than assuming that the reliability of any evidence has to be sacrificed for conflict resolution.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The development of actual strategies for conflict resolution depends on how evidence is gathered and whether and by how much the decision maker may have doubt over the reliability of the evidence in high conflict.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Finally, it should be noted that the ER rule is applicable only to conjunctive combination of independent evidence.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Other rules need to be established to combine dependent evidence, or for non-conjunctive or mixed combination of multiple pieces of evidence that may or may not be independent [7].</a>
