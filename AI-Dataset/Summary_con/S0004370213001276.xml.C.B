<a href="#0" id="0">In this study, we developed a novel algorithm that links a taxonomy of items to a taxonomy of SAs to improve measurements of the similarity of user interests.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our method groups the SAs assigned by users to items into SCs, and the SAs/SCs assigned to an item reflect the classes in which they are included.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, our method can compute the similarity of users based on the SAs/SCs assigned to the items and those assigned to the item classes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Evaluations using two different datasets showed that our method, Linked Taxonomies, yielded more accurate recommendations than previous methods, especially for highly ranked items in the list.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It can also automatically classify effective and ineffective SAs to make more accurate recommendations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, taxonomy designers can rely on the classification results to adjust or maintain the taxonomy of SAs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Based on this study, we envision the following two future research directions:</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Linked taxonomies could be applied to tags other than SAs, such as content tags and context tags, because several different types of semantic relationships exist for different tag types.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our future research is expected to include methods that incorporate several types of semantic relationships and the taxonomies of tags will be applied to measure the user similarity.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These methods are promising because they can predict the future item transactions of users by analyzing their prior item transactions based on detailed semantic user modeling.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this study, we applied our method to neighborhood-based CF.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Alternatively, we could apply the concepts of linked taxonomies to model-based CF, which will allow the analysis of multi-object relationships, such as the relationships among users, items, and tags, which were considered in the present study.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For example, tensor factorization [39] facilitates highly accurate recommendation prediction because a tensor can handle multi-object relationships in a natural manner.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">However, tensor factorization does not incorporate the idea of taxonomies of objects or linked taxonomies.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We consider that data-driven factorization models and semantic data representations of objects based on taxonomies are important for analyzing human activities in detail.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We conclude that recommendation methods that understand the SAs users give to items will generate promising applications, because applications on the Web are becoming more human-centered.</a>
