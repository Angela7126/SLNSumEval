<a href="#0" id="0">We have defined a logic for reasoning about ambiguity, and then showed that, in two senses, we really do not need structures with ambiguity: (1) the same axioms hold whether or not we have ambiguity, and (2) we can use a richer language to talk about the ambiguity, while giving an unambiguous interpretation to all formulas.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So why do we bother using structures with ambiguity?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Perhaps the main reason is that it allows us to describe the situation from the agent's point of view.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, if we are dealing with outermost scope, an agent does not realize that there are other interpretations possible other than the one he is using.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, the simpler language more directly captures agents' assertions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Similarly, a structure with ambiguity may more accurately describe a situation than a structure with a common interpretation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We thus believe that structures with ambiguity will prove to be a useful addition to a modeler's toolkit.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In any case, whatever modeling framework and language is used, it is clear that we need to take ambiguity into account, and reason explicitly about it.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">There are two extensions of our framework that we have not considered.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">First, we model ambiguity by allowing a formula to be interpreted differently by different agents, we assume that each individual agent disambiguates each formula.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">That is, no agent says “I'm not sure how to disambiguate ϕ. It could correspond to the U of worlds, or it could correspond to {a mathematical formula}U′; I'm not sure which is right.” As we mentioned earlier, this view is closer to that of Lewis [9] and Kuijer [8].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">It would involve a nontrivial change to our framework to capture this.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Second, we have allowed only ambiguity about the meaning of primitive propositions (which then extends to ambiguity about the meaning of arbitrary formulas).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">But we have not considered ambiguity about the meaning of belief; for example, i might interpret belief in ϕ terms of having a proof of ϕ in some axiom system, while j might use a possible-worlds interpretation (as we do in this paper).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Capturing this seems interesting, but quite difficult.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Indeed, even without ambiguity, it is not nontrivial to design a logic that captures various resource-bounded notions of belief.</a>
