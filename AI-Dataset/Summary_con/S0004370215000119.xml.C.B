<a href="#1" id="1">We developed an innovative algorithm called CoreD to check the core-non-emptiness for coalition structures.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since checking core-non-emptiness is NP-complete, we set our research goal to develop an algorithm whose average runtime is much faster than a traditional algorithm called CoreP.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We showed that the performance of our newly developed algorithm called CoreD is much better than CoreP when the core is empty.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, we proposed a new solution concept called the weak ε-core{sup:+}, which is based on the weak ε-core for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS⁎.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It can utilize an approximate {a mathematical formula}CS⁎ value.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Based on the idea of CoreD, we developed an algorithm for checking the non-emptiness of the weak ε-core{sup:+} called {a mathematical formula}ECore+(ε).</a>
