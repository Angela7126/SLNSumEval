<a href="#0" id="0">We proposed an online-learning algorithm that enables a humanoid robotic agent, such as an iCub, to incrementally acquire skills in order of increasing learning difficulty, from its onboard high-dimensional camera inputs and low-level kinematic joint maps, driven purely by its intrinsic motivation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The method combines our recently introduced active modular Slow Feature learning algorithm, called Curious Dr.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">MISFA and the options framework.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We formally defined the underlying learning problem and provided experimental results conducted using an iCub humanoid robot to topple, grasp and pick-place a cup.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To our knowledge, this is the first method that demonstrates continual curiosity-based skill acquisition from high-dimensional video inputs in humanoid robots.</a>
