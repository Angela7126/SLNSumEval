<a href="#0" id="0">This paper investigated the on-line portfolio selection problem and presented a novel strategy named “On-Line Moving Average Reversion” (OLMAR), which exploits “Moving Average Reversion” using on-line machine learning algorithms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proposed approach is able to overcome the limitations of the existing state-of-the-art mean reversion strategies mainly due to the single-period assumption, and achieve fairly encouraging results on several datasets from real-world financial markets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Last but not least, the proposed algorithm runs extremely fast and is thus suitable for large-scale real-world financial applications.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Despite achieving encouraging empirical results, several open issues are worth further exploration in future work.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First of all, it will be interesting to explore theoretical analysis of the mean reversion property and investigate if it is possible to bound the worst-case performance of OLMAR.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Besides, it may be possible to anatomize the portfolio's expected return to better understand the major sources of profit.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Although pure trading strategies have been commonly anatomized{sup:20} in the finance fields [12] for a long time, on-line portfolio selection algorithms have seldom been anatomized in a systematic way, which certainly is worth further investigations.</a>
