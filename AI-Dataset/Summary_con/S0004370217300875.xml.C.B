<a href="#0" id="0">We have introduced generalized possibilistic logic (GPL) as a general framework for reasoning about the revealed beliefs of an external agent.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">At the syntactic level, formulas in GPL are propositional combinations of meta-literals of the form {a mathematical formula}Nλ(α), expressing that it is known that an external agent believes α with certainty (at least) λ. Meta-literals of the form {a mathematical formula}Πλ(α), {a mathematical formula}Δλ(α) and {a mathematical formula}∇λ(α) have also been introduced as abbreviations in the language.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">At the semantic level, the four considered types of meta-literals correspond to lower bounds on the four main uncertainty measures from possibility theory, i.e., the necessity, possibility, guaranteed possibility and potential necessity measures.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have moreover introduced a refinement of {a mathematical formula}Δλ(α) and {a mathematical formula}∇λ(α) to express context-dependent information about the ignorance of the agent in a more compact way.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After presenting an axiomatization of GPL and proving its soundness and completeness, we have studied two different ways to reason about the ignorance of an external agent, based on the principle of minimal specificity and based on guaranteed possibility respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Subsequently, we discussed the ability of GPL to model comparative uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Among others, we axiomatized a logic, which can be embedded in GPL, to reason about arbitrary propositional combinations of statements of the form “α is (strictly) more certain than β”.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As a special case, we obtain that GPL can be used to reason about propositional combinations of defaults, in the sense of System P. Next, we showed that the ability of GPL to model ignorance makes it a natural vehicle for expressing the semantics of non-monotonic logic programming formalisms.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In particular, we showed how disjunctive answer set programs naturally correspond to a type of GPL theories, with answer sets corresponding to minimally specific e-models which are Boolean, in the sense that all interpretations are either possible to degree 1 or to degree 0.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We then compared GPL with a fragment of Lifschitz' logic of minimal belief and negation as failure (MBNF) which generalizes disjunctive answer set programming.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">While there is a close relationship between theories in this fragment of MBNF and the corresponding GPL theories, we have found that the notion of minimality demanded of MBNF models is less strict than the notion of minimal specificity, which is similar to an observation we made in [8] about equilibrium logic.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">While the less demanding notion of minimality in MBNF and equilibrium logic may have technical advantages, in particular for modelling inclusive disjunction [73], this finding casts doubt on the appropriateness of logics such as MBNF and equilibrium logic for epistemic reasoning.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In terms of computational complexity, we found natural decision problems at the first, second, third and fourth level of the polynomial hierarchy, where the third and fourth level are only reached when the refined modalities {a mathematical formula}Δλ(α) and {a mathematical formula}∇λ(α) are allowed.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This confirms that the latter modalities allow us to compactly express knowledge that would otherwise require exponentially long formulas (unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The ability of GPL to model both negation-as-failure and conditionals in an intuitive way demonstrates its versatility as a general logic for reasoning about the beliefs of an agent from an outsider point of view (as opposed to introspective reasoning).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Among others, this makes GPL a natural choice for the formal study of access control mechanisms that need to maintain the confidentiality of some pieces of knowledge.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For example, [76] discusses a number of settings where an information system needs to be able to determine whether answering a given query would allow the user to derive information that is supposed to remain secret, based on possibly incomplete knowledge of what that user already knows.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The use of GPL is also natural in game theoretic settings, where agents need to reason based on their incomplete knowledge about the goals of other agents, e.g., as part of a negotiation process [77].</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">There are several ways in which GPL can be further extended.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">For example, a framework for multi-agent epistemic reasoning could be obtained by encapsulating GPL formulas similarly to how GPL encapsulates propositional formulas.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Let us write {a mathematical formula}N(λ,A)(α) to denote that agent A knows α with certainty λ. A formula such as {a mathematical formula}N(λ,A)(N(μ,B)(β)) expresses that (I know) that A knows with certainty λ that B knows β with certainty μ. At the semantic level, in the two-agent case, e-models would be of the form {a mathematical formula}(πA,πB,πAB,πBA), where {a mathematical formula}πA and {a mathematical formula}πB are possibility distributions over propositional interpretations (encoding what objective formulas A and B know), and {a mathematical formula}πAB and {a mathematical formula}πBA are possibility distributions over possibility distributions over propositional interpretations (encoding resp.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">what A knows about what B knows, and what B knows about what A knows).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">We then have e.g. {a mathematical formula}(πA,πB,πAB,πBA)⊨N(λ,A)(α∧N(μ,B)(β)), expressing that (I know that) A knows α and A knows that B knows β, iff {a mathematical formula}πA⊨Nλ(α) and {a mathematical formula}NAB{τ|τ⊨Nμ(β)}≥λ, where {a mathematical formula}NAB is the necessity measure induced by {a mathematical formula}πAB.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Note that this approach does not allow us to consider chains of arbitrary length, e.g., formulas such as {a mathematical formula}N(λ1,A)(N(μ,B)(N(λ2,A)(α))) would require e-models of the form {a mathematical formula}(πA,πB,πAB,πBA,πABA,πBAB).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">In practice, this would not be a restriction, as we only need to consider those chains that appear in the given GPL knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Among others, it would be interesting to see how the interplay between minimal specificity and guaranteed possibility would allow us to model limits on agents' knowledge, and how such models would compare against multi-agent extensions of only knowing [78], [79].</a>
