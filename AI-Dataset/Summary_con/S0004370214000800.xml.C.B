<a href="#0" id="0">This paper presented a novel framework of Online Transfer Learning (OTL), which aims to attack an online learning task on a target domain by transferring knowledge from a source domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We addressed two OTL tasks in classification setting and presented two OTL algorithms for different tasks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We offered theoretical analysis of the proposed OTL algorithms, and conducted an extensive set of experiments, in which encouraging results were obtained.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, we explored the OTL technique as a natural extension to tackle the challenging task of learning over concept-drifting data streams, and proposed an effective algorithm which was validated by the promising empirical results.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Through this work, we hope to encourage further research on in-depth investigations of OTL to address other hard problems, e.g., how to perform heterogeneous OTL from complex data of completely diverse feature representations, how to derive better theoretical bounds of the proposed OTL algorithms, and how to develop new applications of OTL techniques to tackle other various challenges in AI community.</a>
