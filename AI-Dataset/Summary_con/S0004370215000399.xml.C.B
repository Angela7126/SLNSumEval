<a href="#1" id="1">Although lots of work have been done to tackle this problem, there are still various important issues left for the researchers to deal with.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, a novel approach based on MA using both MatchFmeasure and UIR has been proposed to aggregate different similarity measures into a single metric, and optimize the quality of multiple ontology alignments simultaneously without using reference alignment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The experimental results have shown that the MA using both MatchFmeasure and UIR is effective to automatically configure the parameters of similarity aggregation process and our approach could simultaneously deal with multiple pairs of ontologies and avoid the bias improvement caused by MatchFeasure, and the comparison with state-of-the-art ontology matching systems indicates that our proposal is effective.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In continuation of our research, the work is now being done on embedding MA using both MatchFmeasure and UIR into a real ontology alignment system.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We are also interested in developing an Expert Decision Support System to help the ontology alignment system to automatically decide the parameters and even which similarity measures should be utilized.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, since the assumption of complete 1:1 alignments is a rather strong restriction, which might not be suitable for many real-world scenarios, a relaxation of this constraint should be taken into consideration in the future work.</a>
