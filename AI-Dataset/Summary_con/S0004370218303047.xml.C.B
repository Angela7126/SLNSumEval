<a href="#0" id="0">We have presented a framework for specification and analysis of Bayesian networks, particularly networks containing repetitive patterns that can be captured using function-free first-order logic.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our specification framework is based on previous work on probabilistic programs and structural equation models; our analysis is based on notions of complexity (inferential, combined, query, data, domain) that are similar to concepts used in lifted inference and in probabilistic databases.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our emphasis was on knowledge representation; in particular we wanted to understand how features of the specification language affect the complexity of inferences.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus we devoted some effort to connect probabilistic modeling with knowledge representation formalisms, particularly description logics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We hope that we have produced here a sensible framework that unifies several disparate efforts, a contribution that may lead to further insight into probabilistic modeling.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Another contribution of this work is a collection of results on complexity of inferences, as summarized by Table 1 and related commentary.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We have also introduced relational Bayesian network specifications based on the {a mathematical formula}DLLitenf logic, a language that can be used to specify probabilistic ontologies and a sizeable class of probabilistic entity-relationship diagrams.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In proving results about {a mathematical formula}DLLitenf, we have identified a class of model counting problems with tractability guarantees.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, we have shown how to transfer our results into plate models and PRMs, and in doing so we have presented a much needed analysis of these popular specification formalisms.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">There are several avenues open for future work.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Ultimately, we must understand the relationship between expressivity and complexity of Bayesian networks specifications as thoroughly as we understand this relationship for logical languages.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To do so, we may consider Bayesian networks specified by operators from various description and modal logics, or look at languages that allow random variables to have more than two values.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In a different direction, we must look at parameterized counting classes [42], so as to refine the analysis even further.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">There are also several problems that go beyond the inferences discussed in this paper: for example, the computation of Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) configurations, and the verification that a possibly cyclic PRM is consistent for every possible skeleton [35].</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">There are also models that encode structural uncertainty, say about the presence of edges [69]; novel techniques must be developed to investigate the complexity of such models.</a>
