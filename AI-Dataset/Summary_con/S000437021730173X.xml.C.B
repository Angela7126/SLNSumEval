<a href="#0" id="0">Star-topology decoupling is a new state space reduction method for reachability analysis in compactly described discrete transition systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It exploits a form of conditional independence between leaf components in a star topology, given a fixed transition sequence of the center component.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The decoupled state space branches over center transitions only, and maintains leaf state spaces separately.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thanks to that separation, state space size can be exponentially reduced.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Blow-ups can also occur in principle, but that can be avoided with suitable pruning techniques.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The method has exponential separations from all previous state space reduction methods in theory.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In practice, on standard AI Planning benchmarks with a pronounced star topology, it outperforms previous methods in terms of the most basic measure of reduction power, exhausting the state space.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The empirical advantage reduces when using orthogonal search enhancements, but is still manifested in situations where previous methods are weak.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">From these results, it is clear that star-topology decoupling is a promising new method for reachability analysis.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Its suitability for pronounced star topologies – with many leaf components that exhibit individual mobility, not affecting the center state in every transition – makes it an exciting method to try on problems that come with such structure by design.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Multi-agent systems of cooperative agents with shared variables, e.g. shared resources, are one example.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The application to model checking also is very promising, as star topology is a pervasive design paradigm in distributed and concurrent computing settings.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Client–server architectures are a classical example.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">A highly relevant recent direction are concurrent programs under weak memory models (e.g. [108], [109], [110], [111]).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Processes run locally on separate processors, and read/write operations are performed on local memory.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Explicit “fence” operations wait for local memory to be fully committed to global memory, and a consistent view of memory needs to be guaranteed.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Observe that star-topology decoupling is especially suited here, as there may be many processors (leaf components), and many local operations (leaf mobility), and the objective is to verify correctness (exhaust the state space).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Key challenges include the adaptation to the system-description languages used in model checking, and the extension to checking temporal properties, beyond reachability (i.e., beyond safety).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">It may be possible to better leverage star-topology decoupling in planning through better factoring methods.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Initial progress in this direction was recently made [112].</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">An interesting question is whether recent methods for identifying planning backdoors can be adapted for that purpose.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Star-topology decoupling is complementary to previous search enhancements, and there are manifold opportunities for combining it with these.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The authors have already devised combinations with strong stubborn sets [103], symmetry reduction [113], and BDDs for representing leaf state spaces [114].</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Beyond these, the combination with unfolding methods seems particularly promising.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Last but not least, star-topology decoupling can be viewed as a form of target-profile factoring, that looks for a particular structural profile suited to specialized combinatorial search algorithms.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Beyond star profiles, this suggests an entirely new way of exploiting structure in AI Planning: Instead of relaxing the planning task into a (structurally defined) fragment to obtain a heuristic function, try to factorize the task into the fragment to obtain a plan.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">This suggests a new direction for causal graph research, designing fragments suited to specialized combinatorial search algorithms, as opposed to tractability analysis.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">In the long term, this could lead to an entire portfolio of target profiles.</a>
