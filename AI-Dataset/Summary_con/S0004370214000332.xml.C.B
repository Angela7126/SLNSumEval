<a href="#0" id="0">The simplest formal optimization problem underlying CPD looks for a Global Minimum Energy Conformation (GMEC) over a rigid backbone and altered side-chains (identity and conformation).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In computational biology, exact methods for solving the CPD problem combine dominance analysis (DEE) and an {a mathematical formula}A⁎ search.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The CPD problem can also be directly formulated as a Cost Function Network, with a very dense graph and relatively large domains.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have shown how DEE can be integrated with local consistency with a reasonable time complexity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The CPD can also be easily reduced to optimization in MRF, 01LP, 01QP, weighted partial MaxSAT, and Boolean quadratic optimization, offering an ideal benchmark for a large cross-technology comparison.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">On a variety of real instances, we have shown that state-of-the-art optimization algorithms on graphical models exploiting bounds based on the reformulation (or reparametrization) of the graphical model, but also 01LP algorithms, give important speedups compared to usual CPD algorithms combining dead-end elimination with {a mathematical formula}A⁎.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Among all the tested solvers, toulbar2 was the most efficient solver and its efficiency was further improved by the use of DEE during search.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also showed that these CPD problems define challenging benchmarks for a variety of solvers, including weighted partial MaxSAT solvers, either branch-and-bound or core-based, and quadratic programming or quadratic optimization solvers, including semidefinite programming based solvers.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In practice, it must be stressed that just finding the GMEC is not a final answer to real CPD problems.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">CPD energies functions represent an approximation of the real physics of proteins and optimizing a target score based on them (such as stability, affinity, …) is not a guarantee of finding a successful design.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Indeed, some designs may be so stable that they are unable to accomplish the intended biological function.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The usual approach is therefore to design a large library of proteins whose sequences are extracted from all solutions within a small threshold of energy of the GMEC.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This problem is also efficiently solved by toulbar2[83].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Although it is easy to formulate as a discrete optimization problem, another important limitation of the rigid backbone/rotamer CPD problem lies in the restrictions generated by these two assumptions.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In practice, rotamers offer a continuous range of rotations along dihedral angles and backbones also have degrees of flexibility.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Several approaches have been proposed and introduced in osprey in the last few years that relax either or both of these two assumptions while still offering a guarantee of optimality [40], [29], [31].</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">When flexibility counts, osprey is therefore a reference tool.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">All these approaches ultimately require to solve the very same type of optimization problems involving a sum of precomputed pairwise lower bounds on energy terms.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In this context, it becomes crucial to be able to enumerate all the solutions within a threshold of the optimum.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">These approaches should therefore ultimately also benefit from algorithmic improvements in GMEC optimization, as far as exhaustively enumerating all the solutions within a threshold of the optimum is feasible.</a>
