<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we design a heuristic with emphasis on hard clauses, called EHC, for SLS algorithms for solving the WPMS problem.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By incorporating the EHC heuristic into CCLS, we present a new SLS algorithm named CCEHC for solving WPMS.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of our CCEHC algorithm, we evaluate CCEHC on a broad range of WPMS benchmarks, including random, crafted, industrial and real-world application instances.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our experimental results show that CCEHC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SLS algorithms namely CCLS, Dist and DistUP on these WPMS benchmarks, indicating that CCEHC establishes a new state of the art on SLS algorithms for solving WPMS.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our further experimental results on evaluating CCEHC with a state-of-the-art complete solver WPM-2014 show the effectiveness of CCEHC on random WPMS instances, crafted WPMS instances and many WPMS instances based on real-world applications.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Particularly, on a number of important real-world application WPMS instances, where WPM-2014 and a state-of-the-art lower-bound based complete solver Eva could not return good-quality solutions quickly (e.g., within the cutoff time of 5400 CPU seconds), our CCEHC algorithm is able to produce good-quality solutions fast, which indicates that CCEHC might be genuinely beneficial in practice.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Further, we perform more empirical evaluations to analyze the effectiveness of the EHC heuristic, and the related experiments confirm the effectiveness of each underlying component in the EHC heuristic and demonstrate that our EHC heuristic contributes to the performance of CCEHC on a number of structured WPMS instances and real-world application WPMS instances.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Also, we conduct empirical evaluations to study the combination of CCEHC and the unit propagation initialization and the related experiments show that CCEHC is able to cooperate well with the unit propagation initialization.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In future work, we would like to further study the flexibility of our EHC heuristic, and improve the performance of CCEHC on solving WPMS instances by integrating other powerful algorithmic techniques, such as the ‘Best from Multiple Selections’ strategy [59].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We would also like to build an algorithm-selector consisting of our CCEHC algorithm and other solvers to achieve better performance on solving WPMS instances.</a>
