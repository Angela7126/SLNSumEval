<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we defined an approximator in the domain of active integrity constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The result is a family of semantics for AICs based on existing intuitions in various domains of non-monotonic reasoning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We studied properties of our induced semantics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular the AFT-well-founded semantics possesses desirable properties: it approximates all repairs of various families (stable, justified, grounded) and hence can be used for approximate skeptical query-answering with respect to any of these semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, the AFT-well-founded repair can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the database.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our study is far from finished.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the context of approximation fixpoint theory, ultimate approximators have been studied by Denecker et al. [22].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">They showed that with each two-valued operator, we can associate a canonical approximator.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The ultimate approximator induces another family of semantics for AICs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In other domains, e.g., in logic programming, semantics based on ultimate approximators have some very desirable properties, but in general come at the cost of a higher computational complexity than their “standard” variants.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It remains to be researched if the same holds in the context of AICs.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In this paper, we showed that the class of justified repairs is situated in between the classes of stable and of grounded repairs.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">It is known from AFT that the class of ultimate stable fixpoints also falls in between the classes of stable fixpoints (for any approximator) and grounded fixpoints.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence, an interesting research question would be to verify if justified repairs coincide with ultimate stable fixpoints in this domain, and if not, how they relate.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Another topic with potential for interesting future work is the notion of inconsistency.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Consider for instance the set of AICs {a mathematical formula}{¬a⊃+a,a⊃−a}; intuitively, we expect a semantic operator to derive an inconsistency from any partial action set; in standard AFT this is not possible.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">However, extensions of AFT that accommodate this have been defined [3]; it would be interesting to see how AICs fit in this general theory.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Another AFT-based topic of interest could be to study what safe inductions[9] yield in the context of AICs and whether they can fix problems with the well-founded semantics.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">One last topic on which more extensive research might be needed is the domain of revision programming [31].</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Caroprese and Truszczyński [13] showed structural correspondences between semantics for AICs and semantics for revision programs.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Our paper now paves the way to applying AFT to revision programming as well.</a>
