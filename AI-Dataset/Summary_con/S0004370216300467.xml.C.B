<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we proposed {a mathematical formula}RDFi, a framework that extends RDF with the ability to capture incomplete information using a first-order constraint language {a mathematical formula}L. We gave the formal semantics of {a mathematical formula}RDFi and formally defined how queries expressed in an extension of SPARQL that modifies the FILTER operator so that constraints of {a mathematical formula}L can also be included in the condition part can be evaluated over {a mathematical formula}RDFi databases.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Following the work on incomplete relational databases by Imieli≈Ñski and Lipski [41] and Grahne [30], we first showed that the monotone fragment of CONSTRUCT queries forms a representation system for {a mathematical formula}RDFi and then defined the corresponding certainty problem for {a mathematical formula}RDFi and SPARQL.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Last, we demonstrated the usefulness of {a mathematical formula}RDFi in geospatial Semantic Web applications and compared the modeling capabilities of {a mathematical formula}RDFi with related formalisms found in the literature.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our future work focuses on the following: 1) exploration of other fragments of SPARQL that can be used to define a representation system for {a mathematical formula}RDFi, 2) identification of subclasses of the various spatial and temporal constraint languages {a mathematical formula}L we considered for which the certainty problem is tractable, and 3) extension of the {a mathematical formula}RDFi framework so that incomplete information arises in the subject and object positions of triples.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Regarding this last item, there is already a related line of research on querying incomplete graph data [13].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate how {a mathematical formula}RDFi relates to this body of work.</a>
