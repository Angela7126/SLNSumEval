<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we have proposed a semantic-based regularization approach for learning and inference that generalizes both different kernel machine models, processing real-valued features, and statistical relational learning approaches working on symbolic identifiers and domain knowledge expressed in term of FOL formulas.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The resulting inference mechanism also involves a novel collective classification schema that exploits real-valued features.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As shown in the experimental results, this is useful whenever the feature representation is relatively poor, so as the involvement of the constraints at the time of test significantly improves the performance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This paper significantly extends the theoretical results previously published by presenting intriguing connections with probabilistic models and proposing novel heuristics allowing to tackle more complex learning tasks.</a>
