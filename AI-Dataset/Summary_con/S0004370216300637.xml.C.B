<a href="#0" id="0">In the above we have studied the logical properties of defaults, or more particularly of sentences of the form S's are normally P. We have shown that most, if not all of their capricious logical behavior can be explained on the basis of one simple underlying principle that determines in cases of conflicting defaults which objects are exempted from which rules.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have built two theories based on this principle, one within a circumscriptive framework, and the other in terms of inheritance networks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the appendix we will prove a completeness theorem showing that arguments that can be expressed in both systems are valid on the one account iff they are valid on the other.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Despite the length of this paper, we have only taken the first steps developing these systems.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Undoubtedly, a more systematic model theoretic study of the circumscriptive part will result in a shorter and more elegant proof of the completeness theorem.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also think that on the algorithmic side further investigations may yield simplifications.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, it will become clear in the appendix that things get a lot less complicated if the networks do not have cycles.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, a study like this should be complemented by a study answering the question under which conditions a set of default rules can be safely adopted as a guiding line for taking decisions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Maybe this is a question for methodologists rather than for logicians, but the answer is important to everybody interested in common sense reasoning.</a>
