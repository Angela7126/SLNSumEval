<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we considered problems related to tournament fixing.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although being able to change draws is not always realistic, the computational problems that are considered have been analyzed in post analysis of tournament draws and also shed light on the relative strengths of players.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our main result is that TFP is NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We discussed a number of implications of the result.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We complement the computational hardness result in the paper by presenting algorithms for #TFP â€” both for the general case as well as restricted cases.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A possible future direction is to propose parameterized algorithms for TFP.</a>
