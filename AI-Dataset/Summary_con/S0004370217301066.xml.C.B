<a href="#0" id="0">This article introduces overlapping layered learning methodologies and motivates general scenarios for their use.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The article also includes a detailed description and experimental analysis of the extensive overlapping layered learning approach used by the UT Austin Villa team in winning the 2014 RoboCup 3D simulation competition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:7} Furthermore, the complete learning process is repeated on four different robot body types, showcasing its generality as a paradigm for efficient behavior learning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While first introduced in 2014, overlapping layered learning has continued to be used successfully by the UT Austin Villa team in all years since then as well.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Currently the overlapping layered learning methodologies require a person to select which parameters to freeze and leave open during each successive layer of learning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Additionally, learning of complex skills is manually segmented into different layers of learning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Future work in the area of layered learning includes the automated determination of appropriate subtasks for layered learning, as well as automated identification and selection of useful layer overlap or “seams” to use with overlapping layered learning methodologies.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If these selection processes can be automated it would lessen the burden and potential need for someone with expert domain knowledge when performing optimizations.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A base code release of the 2015 UT Austin Villa RoboCup 3D simulation agent [35], which includes hooks for optimizing the skills and behaviors presented in this work, can be found at http://github.com/LARG/utaustinvilla3d.</a>
