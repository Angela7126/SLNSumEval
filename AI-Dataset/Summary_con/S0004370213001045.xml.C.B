<a href="#0" id="0">This paper is centered on the concept of language independence in finite propositional logic.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The main contributions are as follows:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have defined language independence as robustness w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">symbol translations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have provided a model-based characterization of symbol translations in terms of injective, surjective relations over worlds.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have motivated the need to focus on symbol translations of different types, i.e., satisfying some additional properties, which leads to several notions of language independence.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We have provided a model-based characterization for each one of these properties, and we have shown how they are logically connected.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We have identified the complexity of recognizing symbol translations satisfying properties of interest.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We have investigated the robustness of belief change operators w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">translations of different types.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Only limited forms of language independence are satisfied in the general case.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We have shown that the distance-based operator {a mathematical formula}ΔdD,Σ, where the drastic distance {a mathematical formula}dD and sum as an aggregation function are used, as well as its corresponding drastic revision and update operators are the most robust rational operators in terms of language independence, since they are the only ones that are AIP-language independent (resp.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">BAP-language independent).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Moreover, even SIN-language independence is not guaranteed for rational belief change operators.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This work paves the way for three main directions for further research.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">A first one concerns belief change; deriving “constructive” representation theorems characterizing the class of operators satisfying SIN-language independence would be useful.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">A second direction consists in investigating the “degree” of language independence of other propositional operators from the literature (for instance, abduction, circumscription and other forms of closed-world reasoning).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">A third one consists in determining how our results can be lifted to other propositional settings.</a>
