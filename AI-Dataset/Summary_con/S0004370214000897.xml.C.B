<a href="#0" id="0">The VCG mechanism is not strongly budget balanced: in general, value flows out of the system of agents in the form of VCG payments, which reduces the agents' utilities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In many settings, the objective is to maximize the sum of the agents' utilities (taking payments into account).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For this purpose, several VCG redistribution mechanisms have been proposed that redistribute a large fraction of the VCG payments back to the agents, in a way that maintains strategy-proofness and the non-deficit property.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Unfortunately, sometimes even the best VCG redistribution mechanism fails to redistribute a substantial fraction of the VCG payments.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This results in a low welfare for the agents, even though the items are allocated efficiently.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this paper, we studied strategy-proof allocation mechanisms that do not always allocate the items efficiently.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It turns out that by allocating inefficiently, more payment can sometimes be redistributed, so that the net effect is an increase in the sum of the agents' utilities.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The objective that we pursued is to design mechanisms that are competitive in terms of welfare against the first-best mechanism.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The results obtained in our paper are summarized as follows.</a>
