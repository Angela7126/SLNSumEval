<a href="#0" id="0">Our previous work on practical reasoning using value-based argumentation has required assumptions about the values and preferences of other agents intended to justify particular choices of actions on their part.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These choices can affect the outcome of an action performed by the reasoning agent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Justification of these assumptions is always difficult, particularly when several other agents are involved, multiplying the alternative actions needing consideration.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper we have described an approach in which no assumptions need be made about the values and preferences of others: all that is required is that the agent concerned can identify the values it recognises and indicate their relative worth to itself.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In some cases success may still depend on what the other does, but this can be assessed using bounds on the probabilities of the alternatives available to the other.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that when assessing probabilities we consider the whole range of actions available to the other, rather than the probability of the other performing a specified action.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this way we are able to achieve our objectives of allowing arguments which consider the actions of others, but which do not require assumptions about the beliefs and preferences of the others, while remaining consistent with multi-criteria utility theories, and the dominant actions of game theory.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus we have shown how to:</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Remove the need to speculate on the beliefs, assumptions and preferences of other agents;</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Relate the value-based argumentation approach to approaches based on multi-criteria utility and game theory.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Express reasons based on utility and expected returns as arguments, and objections to them, so that the arguments are genuinely for a particular action by the agent concerned rather than participation in a joint action, as was the case in [19].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Express this reasoning in the form of argumentation schemes to facilitate integration with existing forms of practical reasoning using a value-based approach.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Evaluate our approach by demonstrating that it is able to mirror results of empirical studies that model different societies' values in scenarios from experimental economics.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We believe that these five points together provide an improvement in the quality of value-based argumentation for choosing particular actions.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Note also that the dominance of an action is dominance for that agent: it depends on the subjective values and aspirations of the individual agent.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Which action is considered dominant by a particular agent or audience will depend on the values recognised, and the relative importance assigned to them, rather than fixed payoffs determined by the game, allowing each agent to set its own objectives.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In addition to providing some encouraging first results that reproduce the results of ethnographic experiments, we have, for future work, set out how the approach can be more broadly empirically tested using new experimental studies.</a>
