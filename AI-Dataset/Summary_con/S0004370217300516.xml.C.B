<a href="#0" id="0">The coalition structure generation problem has been reconsidered in this paper, by taking into account constraints on the allowed coalitions defined in terms of “valuation structures”.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A clear picture of the complexity issues arising in this setting has been depicted, by singling out islands on tractability based on the properties of the underlying valuation functions and of the underlying interaction graphs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Notably, the results have been formulated in a way that is independent of the specific scheme being adopted to represent the valuations functions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular, they hold for any given compact encoding.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A number of concrete applications have been discussed, too.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our work paves the way for further investigations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">First, it would be interesting to study further kinds of constraints that are likely to occur in real-world application domains, in addition to those associated with pivotal agents and interaction graphs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">With this respect, inspired by constrained clustering methods (see, e.g., [72]), we envisage that general forms of cannot-link constraints can be profitably incorporated in the concept of valuation structure, in order to prescribe that some pivotal agent a in S is “incompatible” with some proper subset of {a mathematical formula}S∖{a}—currently, our setting accommodates only the case where a is “incompatible” with all the remaining pivotal agents in {a mathematical formula}S∖{a}.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Further extensions can be defined to deal with a-priori knowledge on the sizes of the coalitions that are allowed to form [7] or with labeling mechanisms more sophisticated than those discussed in Section 2.4 (inspired, e.g., to [12], [20]).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Orthogonally to the above directions, it would be relevant to extend the analysis of the questions related to worth distribution problems in the presence of valuation structures to further solution concepts.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the paper, we have focused on the core and, hence, we mainly dealt with stability issues.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Other solution concepts proposed in the literature, for instance the Shapley value, look at worth distribution problems by taking into account fairness issues, too.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In fact, it is well-known that computing the Shapley value is an intractable problem in general, formally #P-complete.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">However, recent research evidenced that, on some classes of games and when certain structural restrictions are considered, the value can be computed in polynomial time (see, e.g., [38], [3]).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">An interesting question is therefore whether the Shapley value retains this desirable computational property on IDM functions and in presence of valuation structures.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Finally, from the practical viewpoint, the most natural avenue of further research is to embark on the implementation of the approaches we have exhibited to single out islands of tractability and to conduct experimental activity to assess their scalability on synthetic benchmarks and real-world instances.</a>
