<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we developed a novel method for solving hard problems in the area of argumentation in a “complexity-sensitive” way.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From one perspective, the approach can be seen as an argumentation-customized incarnation of the counter-example guided abstraction refinement approach originating from the field of model checking.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our prototype implementation CEGARTIX employs SAT-solvers as underlying inference engines.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Experiments show that CEGARTIX significantly outperforms existing systems developed for hard argumentation problems (i.e. problems under the preferred, semi-stable, or stage semantics).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The fundamental aspects of our approach are generic, allowing in principle to exploit as the underlying NP-oracle systems developed for other reasoning problems such as CSP or ASP, or even native argumentation systems for “easier” semantics such as the stable or complete semantics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Building necessary ground for the complexity-sensitive approach, we also presented an extensive complexity theoretic analysis, providing new results for certain fragments of argumentation frameworks, as well as distance-based complexity analysis, complementing recent results from [8].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The promising experimental results suggest to apply our approach also to formalisms extending the Dung-style frameworks which we focused on here.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In particular, abstract dialectical frameworks [58] would be an appealing target formalism since it generalizes other proposals such as bipolar [59] and extended argumentation frameworks [60].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the opposite direction, one could consider further fragments of Dung-style frameworks.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For preferred semantics, an interesting class are AFs having a bound number of odd cycles; the complexity of evaluating such AFs is currently open.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">An interesting research direction is to develop complexity-sensitive approaches for this fragment.</a>
