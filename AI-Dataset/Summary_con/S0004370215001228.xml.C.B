<a href="#0" id="0">Parikh, [11], has argued for the central role of relevance in Belief Revision and has shown that the AGM postulates for revision are too liberal in their treatment of this notion.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">He therefore proposed a new intuitive postulate, called axiom (P), to augment the ones proposed by AGM.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this article we developed possible-world semantics for axiom (P).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also proved, contrary to what was conjectured in [11], that axiom (P) is consistent with the full set of the AGM postulates for revision.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consistency was established by showing that Dalal's well-known revision operator satisfies (P).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">What is quite appealing about our results is that the semantic conditions (Q1)–(Q3) that characterise axiom (P) are natural constraints on the comparative plausibility of possible worlds.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In fact condition (SP), which is equivalent to (Q1)–(Q2) in the special case of consistent complete belief sets, has been motivated independently and studied by other authors; for example a translation of (SP) in the realm of epistemic entrenchments, [7], already exists [13].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">An interesting direction for future work would be to extend this translation to cover condition (Q3) as well as belief sets that are not necessarily complete.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, an interesting by-product of our study is the identification of the two possible readings of axiom (P), both of which are plausible depending on the context.</a>
