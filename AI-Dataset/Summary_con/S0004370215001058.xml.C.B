<a href="#0" id="0">We proposed a framework for exploiting sampling in order to solve SCSPs that include random variables over a continuous or very large discrete support.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our framework is based on a number of novel concepts: sampled SCSPs, {a mathematical formula}(α,ϑ)-solutions and {a mathematical formula}(α,ϑ)-solution sets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We employed statistical estimation to determine if a given assignment is consistent with respect to a given set of chance constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As in statistical estimation, the quality of our estimate is determined via confidence interval analysis.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In contrast to existing approaches based on sampling, we provide likelihood guarantees for the quality of the solutions found.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In fact, we explicitly state a confidence probability α that bounds the probability of exceeding a given error tolerance threshold ϑ in our estimation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By properly choosing the estimation error ϑ and the confidence probability α it is possible to generate compact sampled SCSPs that can be effectively solved by existing solution methods.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also extended the reasoning to SCOPs and demonstrated how to produce statistical upper and lower bounds for the value of the optimal solution.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We demonstrated our approach on a number of SCSPs and SCOPs: the static stochastic knapsack problem, a stochastic multiprocessor scheduling problem, and a stochastic lot-sizing problem.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Our computational study demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We conclude by briefly discussing a number of suggestions for future work.</a>
