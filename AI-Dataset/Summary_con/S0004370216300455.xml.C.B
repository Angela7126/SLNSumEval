<a href="#0" id="0">We have presented a novel approach to evaluating epistemic negation; specifically, we proposed to apply epistemic negation to minimize the knowledge in world views (knowledge minimization with epistemic negation), introduced a novel program transformation based on epistemic negation, and presented a new definition of epistemic answer set semantics for general logic programs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This approach overcomes both the problem of unintended world views due to recursion through K and the problem due to M, and thus provides an appropriate solution to epistemic specifications introduced by Gelfond [13] over two decades ago.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our approach is applicable to extend with epistemic negation any existing answer set semantics such as those defined in [26], [27], [32], [1], [8], [12], [29].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For illustration, we extended FLP answer set semantics of Faber et al. [8] to epistemic FLP semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also extended the well-justified FLP semantics of Shen et al. [29] to an epistemic well-justified semantics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We showed that for a propositional program Π with epistemic negation, deciding whether Π has EFLP answer sets is {a mathematical formula}Σ3p-complete and deciding whether a propositional formula F is true in Π under EFLP semantics is {a mathematical formula}Σ4p-complete in general, but has lower complexity for important program classes, such as logic programs that match normal epistemic specifications, where the complexity of world view existence and query evaluation drops by one level in the polynomial hierarchy.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Reasoning with both epistemic and default negations is powerful in expressiveness, but is expensive in computation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Methods for efficient system implementation present a challenging future task.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Currently we are considering implementation for normal epistemic specifications; an attractive property of this class of logic programs is that their epistemic reducts amount to a normal logic program under FLP or well-justified FLP semantics, for which deciding answer set existence is NP-complete.</a>
