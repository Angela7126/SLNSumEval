<a href="#0" id="0">Dung's theory of argumentation has been proposed as a basis for applications, in large part because of its provision of intuitive dialectical characterisations of non-monotonic inference for individual and distributed (dialogical) reasoning accommodating computational and human agents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have argued that such applications require that the theory account for resource bounded agents and features of real-world dialectical reasoning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our focus has been on classical logic instantiations of Dung argumentation frameworks (Cl-Arg) that yield non-monotonic inference relations over first order knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have shown that features of current formulations of Cl-Arg that suffice to ensure satisfaction of rationality postulates, preclude satisfaction of these practical desiderata.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have thus been motivated to formalise an account of Cl-Arg that is both practical and rational.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our solution is to essentially account for the dialectical use of argument by refining the ontology of arguments so as to make explicit the epistemic distinction between an argument's premises assumed true, and those supposed true for the sake of argument.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our approach can thus accommodate a ubiquitous feature of argumentative practice, whereby the inconsistency of arguments' premises is demonstrated dialectically.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We eschew the computationally unfeasible checks on the consistency and subset minimality of arguments' premises that are used to verify the legitimacy of arguments prior to inclusion in an AF, and enumerate minimal and intuitive assumptions as to the arguments constructed from a base for inclusion in an AF, such that they suffice to ensure rational outcomes.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In particular: 1) arguments with conflicting conclusions are obviously indicative of the inconsistency of their supporting assumptions, as recognised by inclusion of an argument that combines the assumptions to conclude ⋏; 2) construction of an argument whose support makes use of redundant premises that contaminate an argument, implies construction of the non-contaminated argument excluding the redundant premises.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We have shown that assuming only partially instantiated frameworks ({a mathematical formula}pdAFs), key properties of Dung frameworks are satisfied.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Also, the consistency and closure postulates are satisfied assuming arbitrary preference relations, with consistency being shown for admissible (and not just complete) extensions; a result that we argue is important for practical applications in which it often suffices to defend an argument by showing membership in an admissible extension.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We have also identified a notion of redundancy of an argument's assumptions that does not appeal to subset minimality, but rather to the syntactic relatedness of the assumptions and conclusion, such that redundant arguments that make use of syntactically disjoint assumptions can be excluded proof theoretically.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Thus non-redundant {a mathematical formula}pdAFs instantiated by proof theories that exclude redundant arguments, trivially satisfy condition 2) above.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Moreover, we have shown that despite dropping the legitimacy checks on arguments, {a mathematical formula}pdAFs satisfy the non-interference and crash resistance postulates (which in this paper are generalised to argument frameworks instantiated by first order theories) under the assumption that preference relations are dialectically and redundance coherent.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For non-redundant {a mathematical formula}pdAFs it suffices that preference relations are dialectically coherent.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Existing accounts of Cl-Arg typically neglect the study of the proof theoretic means for constructing arguments.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We have argued that such accounts provide ‘schemata’ for classical logic argumentation, as an argument properly constituted should include the reasoning steps employed in entailing the conclusion from the premises (in keeping with the transparency postulate advocated in [27]).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We have therefore proposed a natural deduction proof theory for propositional Cl-Arg that in keeping with practical desiderata for applications: i) provides a more perspicuous account of classical reasoning (in comparison with Gentzen style natural deduction); ii) allows definition of a hierarchy of tractable depth-bounded deducibility relations equating with stepwise increments in agents' assumed inferential resources, and such that {a mathematical formula}pdAFs instantiated up to any given depth meet conditions for satisfaction of the rationality postulates; iii) can be adapted so that only non-redundant arguments are constructed.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">We also provided an argumentative characterisation of the non-monotonic Preferred Subtheories [13], under the assumption that agents may have limited inferential capabilities.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">This paper suggests an ambitious agenda for future work.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We are currently generalising our approach to the ASPIC{sup:+} framework [43] in which arguments are built from strict inference rules that encode the inference relations of deductive logics, as well as defeasible inference rules and premises.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">We believe this will pose few serious challenges, and will involve:</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Differentially labelling the constituents of ASPIC{sup:+} tree structured arguments so as to distinguish rules and premises that are assumed true and supposed true, and adapting this paper's notions of attack defeat and acceptability.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Hence, for example, an argument X concluding ⋏ would target those defeasible rules and premises in the attacked argument that are labelled as suppositions in X.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Identifying syntactically disjoint subsets of premises and rules in an ASPIC{sup:+} argument so as identify explosively and redundantly contaminated arguments, and adapting P1,…,P5 and P4′ so as to define (non-redundant) {a mathematical formula}pdAFs.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Note that this may require stipulating assumptions as to the strict rules used in constructing arguments, such that the property satisfied by classical logic (in Proposition 30) applies to ASPIC{sup:+} arguments.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">{sup:36}</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">With appropriate adaptations of dialectical and redundance coherent preference relations, we then intend showing that partially instantiated frameworks satisfy the consistency and closure postulates (without assumptions on preference relations), and the non-contamination postulates.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Notice that violation of the non-contamination postulates arises because of the encoding of classical logic inference in the strict rules, and as discussed in Section 5 when reviewing [61], avoiding this problem involves significantly compromising the generality of ASPIC{sup:+}, and ‘cleansing’ the framework of inconsistent arguments.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">We therefore aim for satisfaction of these postulates for the fully general version of ASPIC{sup:+} and without any need for cleansing.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Secondly, we intend adapting for {a mathematical formula}pdAFs, argument game proof theories developed for Dung AFs [42].</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">We will then generalise these argument games to persuasion dialogues in which agents submit arguments constructed from their own bases and the premises of arguments that are incrementally added to a public commitment store.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">We believe these to be important steps in achieving our long term aim of formalising accounts of monological reasoning and distributed non-monotonic reasoning through dialogue, suitable for real-world rather than idealised agents.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Moreover, this paper has investigated instantiation of {a mathematical formula}pdAFs by propositional resource bounded proof theories that exclude redundantly contaminated arguments.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">An important future research focus will be the development of first order resource bounded proof theories that exclude redundantly contaminated arguments.</a>
