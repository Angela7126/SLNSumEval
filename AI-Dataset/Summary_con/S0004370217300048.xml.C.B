<a href="#0" id="0">This paper studied three-player contract games consisting of human and computer players.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We defined a new game that comprises three players, two service providers and one customer.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The service providers compete to make repeated contract offers to the customer consisting of resource exchanges in the game.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The customer can join and leave contracts at will.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first contribution of the paper was the design of a “contract game” which is analogous to a market setting in which participants need to reach agreements on contracts over time.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The second contribution was providing sub-game Perfect equilibrium strategies for each of the players.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Specifically, because service providers compete over the customer player, the contracts proposed by both service providers and customers are highly beneficial contracts to the customer, but require a commitment from the customer that would prevent it from signing a contract with the other service provider.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We evaluated computer agents that use the equilibrium strategies in extensive empirical studies in three different countries, the U.S., Israel and China.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We ran several configurations in which two human participants played a single agent participant in various role configurations in the game.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The third contribution is showing via our extensive experiments that the computer agent using equilibrium strategies for the customer role was able to outperform people playing the same role in all three countries.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In particular, the customer agent made significantly more commitment type proposals than people, and requested significantly more chips from service providers than did people.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In contrast, the computer player in the role of the service provider was not able to outperform people due to the fact that people may not behave rationally in the game.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">However, our forth contribution is that introducing a simple model that captures the bounded rationality of people playing the customer role into the formal model of the contract game led to an automated agent that plays well the service provider role.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">These results indicate that in some settings it is possible to build agents that interact proficiently with people using equilibrium strategies.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In future work, we mean to use machine learning models to predict how people behave in the game and to use this insight to improve the performance of the computer agents.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We will need to collect significantly more data instances of people's play for this purpose.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In addition, we mean to conduct more experiments with different board games that vary the dependency relationships between the players, and increase the number of service providers and customers.</a>
