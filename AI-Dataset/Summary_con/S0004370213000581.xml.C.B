<a href="#0" id="0">This work presents the first analysis of the MIC methods that include both a complete review and empirical comparison of the different paradigms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In our analysis, we obtain a compact categorization of the methods based on how they manage the information.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The performed categorization pursues two important objectives: first, to provide a clear picture about the existing approaches, and second to allow an experimental analysis of the different categories of methods, in such a way that methods of the same category perform similarly under different situations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Regarding the empirical study, we provided an extensive analysis that included fourteen algorithms from the three paradigms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to test these algorithms, we used seven databases from four different domains of knowledge.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also included a synthetic database where we were able to study the behavior under controlled conditions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Altogether, the results show clearly that using global, bag-level information leads to superior performance.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this sense, both BS and ES methods can be used, but taking into account certain important design considerations: in the BS methods we must consider the similarity between all the instances, and in the ES method using a Vocabulary-based mapping is important.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This confirmed the analysis provided in the review section, where these design considerations were justified.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we saw that, under certain conditions, the BS approaches become computationally very expensive and, therefore, using vocabulary-based ES methods is a better choice for certain databases.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Summarizing, in addition to provide a clear picture of the type of existent MIC solutions, we also studied important guidelines for obtaining MIC methods that are robust in different databases.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In this sense, we must note that, given a new MIC problem we are faced with, it is difficult to know the type of method that is most suitable for it.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Therefore, finding a set of methods that have a consistently good performance in many situations is important.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Furthermore, this analysis can also help to improve the design of future algorithms by providing a basic framework.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In this sense, it becomes clear in our analysis that the discriminative classifier must be based on global information from the whole bag, and it also becomes clear how this can be done appropriately.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Furthermore, we showed that certain design choices such as following the well-known SMI assumption do not seem to have an impact on the performance, and that it has more impact to focus on new effective ways to extract global information in such a way that the interrelations between instances inside the bag are characterized.</a>
