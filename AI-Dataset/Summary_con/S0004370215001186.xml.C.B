<a href="#0" id="0">In this article, we analysed and discussed our modelling framework for multi-relational models of social spaces.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These results show that not only contexts play an important role in the dissemination of consensus in artificial agent societies, but also that simple mechanisms can generate a great deal of complexity (especially in those scenarios where conventions are being co-learned by multiple agents).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Adding more networks to our opinion dynamics model leads to outcomes where consensus was achieved not only more often but also faster.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular, our results show that achieving convergence (i.e. total consensus in a network) is not a matter of connectivity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">With scale-free networks we managed to achieve consensus more often and quicker than with less clustered networks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This conclusion is especially important for application (or models) dealing with real-world social phenomena, many times represented with such networks.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The second innovation presented in this article was the fact that our model describes an abstract way to represent the time spent on each network using the switching probability.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This temporal component introduces a new dynamic to the study of opinion dynamics.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Considering that in agent neighbourhoods, agents might not be available at all times – and spend different amounts of time in different neighbourhoods –, this is an important factor to be included in simulation models (either representing real-world systems with different levels of abstraction, or artificial agent societies for particular applications).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Future work includes the analysis of different complex network models.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">While k-regular and scale-free networks are two of the most pervasive network examples in social simulation, there has been a growing number of models with different properties inspired by real-world phenomena that can be considered.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We will also analyse the networks according to different properties such as betweenness centrality of certain nodes.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Moreover, we plan to apply what we learned with our consensus games to cooperation problems.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Constructing agents that can learn both behaviour and coordination procedures is a difficult task (especially when working with large distributed artificial societies).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Consensus games such as this one can be used to reduce the search space in problems where agents need to cooperate or coordinate in a decentralised fashion.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">While the convergence and number of encounters seem to be correlated with the average path length, this might not be the only property that plays a role in faster convergence to consensus.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Correlation is just an informal tool that helps us assert if some monotonic relationship exists.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">More research is needed to find out, for instance, if self-reinforced structures – like the ones reported by [39] – exist in our multi-network structures.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In particular, we are interested in finding out if permeability mitigates the effects of such phenomenon.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We have seen that context permeability by context overlapping or switching can provide a fairly straightforward modelling methodology.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This can be used to compose simulation scenarios for more complex social spaces.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">What remains to be done is to identify more precise contextual structures in real-world networks.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">While capturing the structure of real social network can be a daunting task, we do have pervasive records of networking activity between social actors: online social networks.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Analysing these can lead us to insights about complex structural properties that emerge from user activity, and contexts that can be identified within those networks.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">A difficult – but not impossible – prospect for further research would be to track similar contexts between different real online social networks.</a>
