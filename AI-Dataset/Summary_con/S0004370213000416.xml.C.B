<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we have presented a general framework for the study of collective rationality in aggregation theory.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our framework is based on binary aggregation, in which a group of individuals each express a ballot in a binary multi-issue domain, and these ballots are then aggregated into a collective one.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The generality of this setting allowed us to model important problems in multiagent systems such as multi-issue elections, preference aggregation, judgment aggregation, and the problem of choosing from a set of candidates.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have formalised rationality assumptions using a simple propositional language, which enables us to classify such formulas in a syntactic way.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Depending on the syntactic properties of the rationality assumptions at hand we have then investigated the problem of collective rationality: how can we guarantee, by means of classical axiomatic properties, that the outcome of the aggregation satisfies the same rationality assumption as the individual ballots?</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have also studied the opposite problem: we have characterised, given a classical axiomatic requirement for aggregation procedures, the set of integrity constraints that are lifted by all procedures satisfying such properties.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the last part of the paper we have concentrated on quota rules, i.e., procedures defined by means of acceptance quotas for every issue, and especially on the majority rule, obtaining complete characterisations of the set of integrity constraints lifted by such procedures.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our results provide a systematic answer to the question of recognising domains of aggregation over which paradoxes can be avoided, reducing this problem to the syntactical analysis of the propositional formulas that define rationality assumptions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Not only does this allow for a uniform analysis of such diverse problems as preference aggregation, judgment aggregation and multi-issue elections in general, but it also has the advantage of expressing properties in a computation-friendly language such as propositional logic.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This paper constitutes a first step towards a general application-oriented theory of aggregation, a topic that is crucial to the development of several AI applications and, above all, to the design of multiagent systems.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The main achievements of this paper are twofold: First, this work constitutes the first systematic study of collective rationality for non-independent aggregation procedures in binary aggregation.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">While the literature in SCT has traditionally focused on independent aggregation procedures for preferences or judgments, we provided a truly general setting in which classical frameworks can be interpreted and new results can be provided.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Second, to achieve these results we introduced the novel concept of languages for integrity constraints.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">By developing a complex theoretical machinery around this notion we were able to build a link between classical axiomatic properties and collective rationality, proving interesting characterisations and laying the basis for further investigations of aggregation theory.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We conclude by pointing out at some possible directions for future work.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The framework we developed in this paper can be employed to deepen the current analysis of voting in multi-issue domains, e.g., by developing new voting methods based on preferential dependencies.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In this respect, partial achievements have been made by Lang and Xia [28], Conitzer et al. [8], Xia et al. [41] and, in a similar setting, in our previous work [1].</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The generality of the framework we proposed in this paper may also suggest that the aggregation of logical structures represents a promising area for future work.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">We have recently made an initial step in this direction by providing a first study of graph aggregation [13].</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">A similar problem is that of extending our definitions to cover the case of non-binary issues, e.g. by allowing individuals to abstain on certain issues.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Related work has been done in this respect by Dokow and Holzman [12].</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The results proved in the present paper should not be interpreted as limiting the possibility of consistent aggregation, but rather as specifying for each application at hand the right conditions that make it possible.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Perhaps the most intriguing direction for future research is to employ the machinery developed in this paper to design collectively rational aggregation procedures to tackle complex problems of aggregation that occur in AI applications.</a>
