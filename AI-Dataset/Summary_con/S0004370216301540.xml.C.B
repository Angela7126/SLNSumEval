<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we present a novel framework on active transfer learning for cross-system recommendations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the proposed framework, we 1) extend previous transfer learning approaches to CF in a flexible entity corresponding manner, and 2) propose an entity selection strategy to actively construct entity correspondences across different recommender systems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, we develop three specific solutions based on the framework.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our experimental results show that compared with the transfer learning method which requires full entity correspondences, our proposed framework can achieve around {a mathematical formula}34.13%, {a mathematical formula}61.41% and {a mathematical formula}79.28% in RMSE or {a mathematical formula}46.09%, {a mathematical formula}68.91% and {a mathematical formula}82.66% in MAE knowledge-transfer ratio, while only requires {a mathematical formula}0.1% of the entities to have correspondences.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For future work, we are planning to apply the proposed framework to other applications, such as cross-system link prediction in social networks.</a>
