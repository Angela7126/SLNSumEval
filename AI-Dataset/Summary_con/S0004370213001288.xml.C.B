<a href="#0" id="0">Motivated by the fact that real-world electorates are unlikely to be flawlessly single-peaked, we have studied the complexity of manipulative actions on nearly single-peaked electorates.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We observed a wide range of behavior.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Often, a modest amount of non-single-peaked behavior is not enough to obliterate an existing polynomial-time claim.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We find this the most important theme of this paper—its “take-home message.” So if one feels that previous polynomial-time manipulative-action algorithms for single-peaked electorates are suspect since real-world electorates tend not to be truly single-peaked but rather nearly single-peaked, our results of this sort should reassure one on this point—although they are but a first step, as the paragraph after this one will explain.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Yet we also found that sometimes allowing even one deviant voter is enough to raise the complexity from P to NP-hardness.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also have found cases (see Appendix B) where frequency of mavericity extracts a price in terms of amount of nondeterminism used.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We feel this is a connection that should be further explored, and regarding Corollary B.2, we particularly commend to the readerʼs attention the issue of proving completeness for—not merely membership in—the levels of the beta hierarchy.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We conjecture that completeness holds.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">One might quite naturally wish to study other notions of closeness to single-peakedness and, in particular, one might want to combine our notions.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Indeed, in real human elections, there probably are both mavericks and swooners, and so our models are but a first step.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In addition, the types of nearness that appear in different human contexts may differ from each other, and from the types of nearness that appear in computer multiagent systems contexts.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Models of human/multiagent-system behavior, and empirical study of actual occurring vote sets, may help identify the most appropriate notions of nearness for a given setting.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Our control work studies just one type of control-attack at a time.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We suspect that many of our polynomial-time results could be extended to handle multiple types of attacks simultaneously, as has recently been explored (without single-peakedness constraints) by Faliszewski et al. [38], and we mentioned in passing one result for which we have already shown this.</a>
