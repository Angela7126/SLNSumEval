<a href="#0" id="0">We examined a simple but expressive model of cooperation among agents, Coalitional Skill Games (CSGs).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We considered several restricted CSG domains, and examined the computational complexity of some key problems related to game-theoretic solution concepts in these domains.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We showed that we could calculate the value of a coalition in polynomial time in all restricted forms, although some problems of interest remain computationally hard.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Some key results provide tractable algorithms for testing veto agents and dummy agents (in most domains) and computing the core or testing its emptiness (in most domains), while showing that computing power indices is computationally hard.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Several questions remain open for future research.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">First, this paper presents several negative results, especially regarding the ϵ-core and least-core in general domains and regarding computing power indices.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Power indices, however, can be approximated using general algorithms.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">On the other hand, this work only provided positive results regarding ϵ-core and least-core related problems in CSGs in quite restricted domains.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It would be interesting to see if there are other restricted domains where such problems can be tackled, and to find a power index approximation method tailored for CSGs that would outperform such generic power index approximation schemes.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Second, there are game-theoretic solution concepts refining the least-core, such as the nucleolus [58], and a further step would be to examine the complexity of computing these solution concepts.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We conjecture that computing the nucleolus is hard in general CSGs but could be handled in restricted domains.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Third, it is still open to decide whether core non-emptiness is co-NP-complete for TCSGs and WTSGs.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Finally, it would be interesting to see how CSG-based models can be used in applied settings.</a>
