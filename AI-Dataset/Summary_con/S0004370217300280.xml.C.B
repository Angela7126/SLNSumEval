<a href="#0" id="0">We have proposed a “minimalistic” language for causal action theories, and postulated some properties for them.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have considered possible embeddings of these causal action theories in some other action formalisms, and their implementations in logic programs with answer set semantics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, we have proposed to consider what we call permissible translations from causal action theories to logic programs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our computer experiments show that when there are only three fluents in the language, the only permissible translation under strong equivalence that satisfies Property 1, Property 3, Property 4 is Balduccini and Gelfond's translation from the action descriptions in Gelfond and Lifschitz's {a mathematical formula}B language to logic programs; and the only permissible translation under strong equivalence that satisfies Property 1, Property 2, Property 3, Property 4′, Property 5 is Lifschitz and Turner's translation from the action language {a mathematical formula}C to logic programs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, all these properties are necessary for the results to hold.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Dropping any of them will result in multiple permissible mappings.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These results suggest that the action languages {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C are characterized by the two sets of properties, respectively.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For future work, it will be interesting to see whether similar properties and alternative notions of “permissible” translations can be identified for other action formalisms, e.g. MAD and ALM.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It is also interesting to investigate some other properties and see how combinations of these properties can yield different action formalisms.</a>
