<a href="#0" id="0">We presented new results that add to the complexity landscape for ILP w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">structural parameterizations of the constraint matrix.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our main algorithmic result pushes the frontiers of tractability for ILP instances and will hopefully serve as a precursor for the study of further structural parameterizations for ILP.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We note that the running time of the presented algorithm has a highly nontrivial dependence on the treedepth of the ILP instance, and hence the algorithm is unlikely to outperform dedicated solvers in practical settings.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The provided results draw an initial complexity landscape for ILP w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">the most prominent decompositional width parameters.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, other approaches exploiting the structural properties of ILP instances still remain unexplored and represent interesting directions for future research.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For instance, an adaptation of backdoors[17] to the ILP setting could lead to highly relevant algorithmic results.</a>
