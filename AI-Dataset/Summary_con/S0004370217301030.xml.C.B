<a href="#0" id="0">This paper gave an overview on the First International Competition of Computational Models of Argumentation (ICCMA'15).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We described the computational tasks of the competition, its technical setups, and presented the participants.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, we reported on its results and provided some analysis and interpretation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Being the first instance of ICCMA, the organizers were very satisfied with the engagement of the community and its 18 submitted solvers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The competition provided a common background to compare different solvers developed in the last years in the computational models of argumentation community with the adoption, on the one side of novel algorithms, and on the other side, of SATand ASP-based standard solutions, to address heterogeneous goals.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thanks to the results the competition publicly made available, informed decisions about the choice of the right solver to adopt with respect to the computational task to be performed are now possible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The results show unsurprisingly that SAT-based and ASP-based solvers outperform ad-hoc algorithms, but there is still great potential for developing new sophisticated algorithmic approaches to abstract argumentation problems.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The competition has also highlighted new needs that the ICCMA steering committee is evaluating in order to propose new tracks for the upcoming editions of the competition.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">First of all, a track about structured argumentation frameworks has been envisioned, and it is currently under discussion.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The main issue is that there is no structured formalism with a sufficient number of competing solvers, and addressing a comparison of systems implementing different formalisms is extremely laborious.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The lack of existing benchmarks for such a task is another issue in this direction.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Second, a track about natural language argumentation is envisaged as well.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The idea is to include an argument mining tack where tasks such as arguments detection and relations prediction are proposed to the systems.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Also in this case, the main issue is the lack of a common annotation schema, and as a consequence, of a common annotated benchmark to compare all the existing approaches.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The competition was the first in an upcoming series of competitions, the next instance is planned for 2017.</a>
