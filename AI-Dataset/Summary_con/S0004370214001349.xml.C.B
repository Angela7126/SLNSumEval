<a href="#0" id="0">As also shown in previous studies [8], [9], we claim that representation learning is one of the important aspects in human knowledge acquisition, and should be modeled in cognitive theories of human learning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In our theory, perceptual chunks correspond to nodes in a context-free grammar that organizes perceptual knowledge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Perceptual processing is modeled by parsing stimuli using this grammar, with the result being a parse tree that organizes their constituents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The learning process of the representation is carried out in a bottom-up, unsupervised fashion guided by statistical regularities in observed stimuli.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While results show that the acquired representation is able to model some types of student errors, other forms of representation such as discrimination networks [9], [31], [39] and connectionist models (e.g., [72]) are also possible.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We integrate the proposed representation learner into skill learning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We claim that the speed of skill acquisition depends on the quality of the representation given to the skill learner.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By integrating representation learning into skill learning, the speed of skill learning increases.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In later studies [13], we showed that the extended agent can be used to discover better models of student learning, which suggests that the extended agent better models human knowledge acquisition.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To sum up, building an intelligent agent that simulates human-level learning is an essential task in AI and cognitive science, but building such systems often requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm that automatically acquires deep features from observations without any annotation or with light annotations.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We then integrate this stand-alone feature learning algorithm into an intelligent agent, SimStudent, as an extension of the perception module.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We showed that after the integration, the extended SimStudent is able to achieve comparable performance without requiring any domain-specific operator function as input.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In addition to being an effective learner, we further showed that the extended SimStudent could be used to discover better models of real students.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Given all the results, we conclude that the extended SimStudent is a good human-like intelligent agent that requires a small amount of knowledge engineering.</a>
