<a href="#0" id="0">Finding an optimal strategy for limited memory influence diagrams is known to be NP-hard even for polytree-shaped diagrams with ternary variables and a single value node [7].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When the diagram has a single value node, the problem can be mapped into one of computing marginal probability bounds in a properly designed credal polytree [12].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We showed here that this correspondence between influence diagrams and credal networks allows us to solve polytree-shaped diagrams with binary variables and a single value node in polynomial time, as this is the case for computing marginal probability bounds in credal polytrees [17].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The mapping however does not work on diagrams that contain multiple value nodes (even if variables are binary), and the theoretical complexity of the strategy selection problem in polytree-shaped diagrams with binary variables and multiple value nodes was until now unknown.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we showed by a reduction of the partition problem that selecting optimal strategies in polytree-shaped influence diagrams with binary variables and multiple value nodes is NP-hard.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This result closes the fixed-parameter complexity analysis of planning with limited memory influence diagrams in what concerns the topology of the underlying graph and the cardinality of the variables.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In summary, selecting optimal strategies in polytree-shaped limids with binary variables and a single value node is polynomial-time solvable, and relaxing any of these conditions leads to NP-hard problems.</a>
