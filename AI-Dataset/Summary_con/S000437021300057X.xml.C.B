<a href="#0" id="0">This work applies modern planning and machine learning techniques to the quality control problem of crowdsourcing, a new and rapidly-growing method for accomplishing various tasks, and demonstrates the usefulness of decision theory in a real-world setting, by controlling dynamic workflows that successfully achieve statistically-significant, higher-quality results than traditional, non-adaptive workflows.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, we make the following contributions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:19}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As complex workflows have become more commonplace in crowdsourcing and are regularly employed for high-quality output, we introduce an exciting new application for artificial intelligence, the control of these workflows.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We use POMDPs to model single workflows as well as multiple workflows, and define generative models that govern various observation models of the processes.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our agents implement our mathematical framework and use it to optimize and control selection and execution of workflows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Extensive simulations and real-world experiments show that our agents are robust in a variety of scenarios and parameter settings, and achieve higher utilities than previous, non-adaptive policies.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We present efficient and cheap mechanisms for learning model parameters from limited and noisy training data.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We validate the parameters independently and show that our learned models significantly outperform the popular majority-vote baseline when resources are constrained.</a>
