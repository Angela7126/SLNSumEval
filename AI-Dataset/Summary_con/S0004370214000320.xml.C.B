<a href="#0" id="0">We explore a novel transfer learning approach TRAMP to learning action models for planning in the STRIPS representation, when there are only a few limited plan traces or training data available in target domains.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">TRAMP exploits two phases to transfer knowledge from source domains to target domains.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The first phase is to transfer knowledge from source based on plan traces in target domains.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The second phase is to explore extra knowledge from the Web and as thus transfer knowledge from source domains based on Web search.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We compare TRAMP to LAWS and t-LAMP, to see the advantage or disadvantage of using the first or second or both phases in the experiments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also compare our transfer learning framework TRAMP to a state-of-the-art non-transfer learning approach ARMS, showing that TRAMP functions well even though there is no source domain available.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also empirically show that the similarity between source and target domains can be captured by the metric WPLL and using WPLL to filter source domains can indeed improve the transfer learning accuracies.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this paper, we assume that source domains have complete action models and the task is to learn action models for target domains.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the future, we would like to consider the case that when source domains are incomplete and target domains are annotated with a few incomplete model descriptions, the task is to learn action models for both source and target domains.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This is significant since it is easier to collect incomplete domain models for transfer in real world applications, compared to collecting complete models.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In addition, we would like to consider more elaborate representations in PDDL language and test the system in more real world planning domains.</a>
