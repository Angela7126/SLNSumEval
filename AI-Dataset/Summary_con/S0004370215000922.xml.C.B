<a href="#0" id="0">Handling inconsistency has been receiving increased attention in the AI community since most inference methods rely on the consistency of the premises; and such requirement is commonly violated in large bases of probabilistic knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A reasonable start point to deal with the inconsistency in probabilistic bases is to know how severe it is, and how this severity changes with the probabilities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this work, we studied different ways of measuring inconsistency in probabilistic knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Three aspects were discussed: postulates the measures should satisfy, the efficiency of the methods used to compute the measures, and possible meaningful interpretations for them.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As it was argued for, the independence postulate shall be abandoned in favor of continuity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The causes of such incompatibility were analyzed, and a modification of independence was proposed to restore compatibility.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Inconsistency measures that can be computed using linear programs were reviewed and proved to satisfy the postulates, and we gave them a rational by means of Dutch books.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, we showed that other measures in the literature based on Dutch books, and computable through linear programming, also satisfy the postulates.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By restoring the compatibility of the postulates for measuring inconsistency in probabilistic knowledge bases, we put forward a new pair of properties one can use to formulate or evaluate measures: i-independence and IC-separability.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These desirable properties are based on two new concepts: innocuous conditional and inescapable conflicts.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Besides measuring inconsistency, these concepts may be useful for formalizing inference from inconsistent bases or performing probabilistic belief revision/update, for instance.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Both concepts are derived from a specific consolidation procedure â€” the widening of probability intervals.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If other consolidation methods are considered, one can define analogous concepts, even in a different logical formalism.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In AI, inconsistency measures for probabilistic knowledge bases have been based on distance minimization, while in Formal Epistemology incoherence measures for Bayesian agents were focused on Dutch books vulnerability.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The connections here established can help both communities to investigate their corresponding problems under a different angle.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The introduced concepts of innocuous conditional and inescapable conflict might have practical use in measuring inconsistency only if their instances are recognizable in a reasonable time.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Nothing was said here about the complexity of the computational task of finding innocuous conditionals and inescapable conflicts within a knowledge base, but they are clearly very hard problems.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Thus, future work includes investigating these problems aiming at devising algorithms to solve them.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">It would also be interesting to propose concrete procedures to consolidate knowledge bases, as done in [35] for instance.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">To achieve that, one could rely on the same triplet: rationality postulates, efficiency of computation and meaningful interpretation.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Another intended continuation of this work is to study principled ways of inferring probabilistic conclusions from inconsistent bases, using the ideas here presented.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">For instance, this could be done by defining the set of models of an inconsistent base as the set containing all models of each closest consistent base, construed as the consolidations corresponding to some inconsistency measure here studied.</a>
