<a href="#0" id="0">We conducted a focused but extensive comparative analysis of 16 inconsistency measures from the recent literature in terms of their expressivity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For that, we introduced 4 different expressivity characteristics and conducted an analytical evaluation of the considered measures wrt.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">these expressivity characteristics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our findings revealed some interesting relationships of inconsistency measures to, e.g., set theory and monotone Boolean functions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, the measures {a mathematical formula}IdalalΣ[8] and {a mathematical formula}IPm[16] have been proven to be maximally expressive wrt.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">all our characteristics.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Expressivity characteristics provide a novel evaluation method for assessing the quality of inconsistency measures.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It has to be noted again, however, that high expressivity alone is not a sufficient criterion for doing this.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It is straightforward to construct measures that exhibit maximal expressivity along all discussed dimensions, but fail to comply with the intuitions one expects from inconsistency measures.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The use of rationality postulates—such as the ones presented and discussed in Hunter and Konieczny [11]; Mu et al. [25]; Besnard, [2]—must still serve as first-level evaluation criterion.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">If measures satisfy the same (or a similar set of) rationality postulates, expressivity can be used to make further quality assessments.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To the best of our knowledge, our work is the most extensive comparative analysis of inconsistency measures so far.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">All inconsistency measures discussed in this paper have been implemented and an online interface to try out these measures is available.</a>
