<a href="#0" id="0">Qualitative models are an established tool in many areas of science, most notably in economics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">They have however stirred surprisingly little interest in the machine learning community.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have presented, to our knowledge, the first machine learning method for induction of qualitative models from categorical data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The method has a solid theoretical background and works well in practice.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the Rat domain we have shown that Qube correctly captures the qualitative relations even when the underlying concept is relatively complex.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Experiments on another synthetic domain show that it performs robustly in the presence of noise and irrelevant attributes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The presented case studies suggest that it also scales well to more complex domains.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the billiards case study Qube successfully modeled the preferences regarding the shot type in different settings of the balls on the table.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, the medical case study also shows its more usefulness on general labeled data beyond preference learning or decision making.</a>
