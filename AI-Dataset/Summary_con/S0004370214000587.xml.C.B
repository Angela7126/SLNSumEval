<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive account of our efforts to solve the entire Standard and Advanced Raven's Progressive Matrices tests using fractal representations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We developed the Fractal Ravens algorithm, a computational model which uses features derived from fractal representations to calculate Tversky similarities between relationships in the test problem matrices and candidate answers, and which uses levels of abstraction, through re-representing the fractal representation at differing resolutions, to determine overall confidence in the selection of an answer.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, we presented a comparison of the results of running the Fractal Ravens algorithm to all available published accounts, and showed that the Fractal Ravens algorithm's performance at detecting the correct answer met or exceeded those accounts.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">McGreggor [53] provides more details about our work.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Analogy initiates with an act of being reminded.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We hold that fractally representing both that triggering percept as well as all prior percepts affords unprecedented similarity discovery, and thereby analogy-making.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The Fractal Ravens algorithm, through its use of fractal representations and featural similarity evoked by recall, demonstrates these claims.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Although we have focused our attention on representation and computational psychometrics, and drawn comparisons between the Fractal Ravens performance and that of humans, we emphasize that what we developed within this paper are AI techniques and algorithms.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">While we expressly asserted no claims as to whether our model may be extended to provide a cognitive accounting, given the development of our computational model and the nature of our representation, it is our hope to spur others to explore additional computational and perhaps cognitive accounts of the intricate interplay between perception and analogy.</a>
