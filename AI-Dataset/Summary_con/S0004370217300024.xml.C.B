<a href="#0" id="0">We have introduced the problem of graph aggregation and analysed it in view of its possible use to combine information coming from different agents who each specify an alternative set of edges on the same set of vertices.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our focus has been on the concept of collective rationality, i.e., the preservation of certain properties of graphs under aggregation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our results are formulated with respect to various meta-properties that may or may not be met by a specific property of graphs one may be interested in.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have explored two different approaches to the definition of such meta-properties.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Using a semantic approach, we have defined certain templates (namely contagiousness, implicativeness, and disjunctiveness), which are easy to recognise in common graph properties and which make the features of graph properties required to carry through our proofs particularly salient.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Using a syntactic approach, we have used formulas expressible in certain fragments of modal logic to describe properties of graphs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Most of our technical results establish conditions under which it is either possible or impossible to guarantee collective rationality with respect to graph properties that meet certain meta-properties.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our main technical result is a generalisation of Arrow's Theorem for preference aggregation to aggregation problems for a large family of types of graphs that include the types of graphs used by Arrow to model preferences.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To establish this theorem, as well as a closely related theorem identifying conditions that can only be satisfied by an oligarchic aggregation rule, we have refined the (ultra)filter method for proving impossibility theorems in social choice theory.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Besides these technical contributions, we have also demonstrated how insights from the abstract setting of graph aggregation can be put to use in a variety of application domains.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">While we have been able to demonstrate that our choice of meta-properties is particularly useful for quickly proving results in a wide variety of different domains, our impossibility theorems only establish sufficient conditions for impossibilities and there is room for future research on other such sufficient conditions and also for a complete characterisation of the family of types of graphs for which Arrovian aggregation is impossible.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">A good starting point for such an undertaking would be closely related work in judgment aggregation [14], [51].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Much of this paper has focused on Arrovian aggregation rules, and more specifically on the consequences of accepting the axiom of independence.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The prime direction to escape our impossibilities is therefore to relax this axiom, and to study rules that are not independent.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In Section 2.3, we have already briefly mentioned the idea of adapting distance-based aggregation rules—familiar from preference aggregation, judgment aggregation, and belief merging—to our setting.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Distance-based rules are collectively rational by definition, but unfortunately have the drawback of typically being computationally intractable.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Investigating the trade-off between complexity and collective rationality when designing aggregation rules for specific classes of graph aggregation problems thus presents an important challenge for future research.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Besides such technical investigations, future work should continue to focus on applications of graph aggregation.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Our discussion in Section 5 demonstrates the usefulness of adopting the general perspective of graph aggregation in the domains of preference aggregation, nonmonotonic reasoning and belief merging, cluster analysis, and argumentation.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Future work should also address the other application scenarios identified in Section 2.2 and it should identify new ones.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">One promising direction concerns work on theory change in the philosophy of science, where one recent model has used the Arrovian framework of preference aggregation to analyse how scientists choose between rival scientific theories in terms of preferences induced by criteria such as simplicity or fit with available data [70].</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The more general framework of graph aggregation opens up new possibilities for investigating the subtle differences that presumably exist between the preferences of an economic agent and the preferences induced by scientific criteria for accepting a novel theory.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Another—entirely different but equally promising—direction for future research is in the area of the Semantic Web and concerns work on XML data integration[71].</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The basic structure underlying documents encoded in XML (the extensible markup language) is that of a tree, i.e., a special kind of graph.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Thus, if we want to combine information encoded using XML that has been obtained from different sources on the Semantic Web, we need to use some form of graph aggregation as well.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">{sup:16} But also this extended list of potential applications is bound to be incomplete, given the ubiquity of graphs across so much of science and scholarship.</a>
