<a href="#0" id="0">We introduced an improved instance-specific algorithm configurator by adding a non-cluster based portfolio stage to the existing ISAC approach.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Extensive tests showed that the new method consistently outperforms the best instance-specific configurators to date.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We applied the new method to partial MaxSAT, a domain where portfolios had never been used in a competitive setting before we conducted this work.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We devised a method to extend features originally designed for SAT to characterize weighted partial MaxSAT instances.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, we built three instance-specific partial MaxSAT solvers for crafted and industrial instances, as well as a combination of those.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Results clearly showed the improvements of the new instance-specific tuner over the prior state-of-the-art in tuning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A 10-fold cross validation in the four categories of the 2012 MaxSAT evaluation confirmed these findings.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Based on this work we entered our solvers in the 2013 MaxSAT Competition, where they won six out of eleven categories and came in second in another four.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We subsequently updated the portfolio with new solvers and submitted it to the 2014 MaxSAT Competition, where it placed in seven of the nine categories, winning three of them.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These results independently confirm that our solvers mark a significant step forward in solving MaxSAT instances efficiently.</a>
