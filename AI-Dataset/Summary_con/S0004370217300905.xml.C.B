<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we introduced MM, the first Bi-HS algorithm guaranteed to meet in the middle.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We also introduced a framework that divides the state space into disjoint regions and allows a careful analysis of the behavior of the different algorithms in each of the regions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We studied the various types of algorithms and provided some general rules that were confirmed by our experiments.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This paper initiated this direction.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Future work will continue as follows: (1) A deeper analysis on current and new MM variants may further deepen our knowledge in this issue.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">(2) A thorough experimental comparison should be done on more domains and with more bidirectional search algorithms.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(3) Heuristics that are specifically designed for MM, i.e., that only return values larger than {a mathematical formula}C‚Åé/2 are needed [62].</a>
