<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we have studied a class of multicategory coherence loss functions as well as the relationship between the multicategory coherence and hinge losses.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As majorization functions of the 0â€“1 loss, the multicategory coherence loss functions are Fisher-consistent, infinitely smooth and convex.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, it is appropriate for the design of margin-based boosting algorithms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular, we have devised a multiclass {a mathematical formula}C learning algorithm and a multiclass GentleBoost algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While our main focus has been theoretical, we have also shown experimentally that our algorithms are effective.</a>
