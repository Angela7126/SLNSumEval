<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a simple framework for incorporating similarity in feature space and space or time into sparse coding.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We also propose in this paper modifying sparse coding by replacing the lasso optimization stage by marginal regression and adding a constraint to enforce incoherent dictionaries.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The resulting algorithm is significantly faster.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This facilitates scaling up the sparse coding framework to large dictionaries, an area which is usually restricted due to intractable computation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This work leads to several interesting follow-up directions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">On the theoretical side, local convergence of Lasso-based sparse coding has been analyzed recently â€“ preliminary examination suggests that the proposed marginal-regression based sparse coding algorithm might be more favorable for the local convergence analysis.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It is also interesting to explore tighter generalization error bounds by directly analyzing the solutions of the marginal regression based iterative algorithm.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Methodologically, it is interesting to explore if using an adaptive or non-constant kernel bandwidth leads to higher accuracy.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Furthermore alternative methods for imposing incoherence constraints that may lead to easier optimization is an interesting direction to investigate.</a>
