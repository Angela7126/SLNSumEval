<a href="#0" id="0">We present two symbolic BDD-based algorithms to model checking bounded ATL in multiagent systems of incomplete information and perfect recall.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The computational complexity of the model checking problem is shown to be PSPACE-complete, no more than the LTL model checking.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The algorithms have been implemented in a model checker and our experimental results show the usefulness of them in deal with interesting applications.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the future work, we may consider the bounded ATL of other semantics, e.g., the strategies of agents are based on common knowledge or individual knowledge, instead of the distributed knowledge we considered in the paper.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, we may consider extending the algorithms in the paper to work with stochastic multiagent systems.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have proposed PATL logic [44] to express the properties like “a set A of agents have a collective strategy to enforce the goal ϕ in a probability more than {a mathematical formula}90%”.</a>
