<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we have investigated theoretically and empirically the computational complexity of manipulation problems for the Borda voting rule and two extensions of Borda voting, Baldwin's and Nanson's rules.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We proved that it is NP-hard to compute a coalitional manipulation of the Borda rule with just two manipulators.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This resolves a long-standing open question regarding the computational complexity of unweighted coalitional manipulation for common voting rules.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We showed that two other rules, Baldwin's and Nanson's rules, which are derived from the Borda rule are also NP-hard to manipulate both with weighted and unweighted votes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Because of these NP-hardness results, we proposed several simple heuristic methods.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We showed that they can compute optimal manipulations of the Borda rule in almost all the randomly generated elections.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This suggests that the Borda rule is not resistant to manipulation in practice.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In contrast, these heuristic algorithms did not perform as well in either Baldwin or Nanson elections, suggesting that these elimination style rules are more resistant to manipulation than the Borda rule.</a>
