<a href="#1" id="1">It is well-accepted that the margin distribution is crucial for characterizing the performance of AdaBoost, and it is desirable to theoretically establish generalization bounds based on margin distribution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we first present the kth margin bound and further study on its relationship to previous work such as the minimum margin bound and Emargin bound.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then, we improve the empirical Bernstein bound with different skills.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As our main results, we prove a new generalization bound which considers exactly the same factors as Schapire et al. [39] but is sharper than the bounds of Schapire et al. [39] and Breiman [9], and thus provide a complete answer to Breiman ºs doubt on the margin theory.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By incorporating other factors such as average margin and variance, we present another generalization error bound which is heavily related to the whole margin distribution.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In addition, we provide margin bounds for generalization error of voting classifiers in finite VC-dimension space.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">An interesting future issue is to develop new algorithms based on our theory.</a>
