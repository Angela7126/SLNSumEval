<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we presented a visual concept structure discovery framework by formulating a novel Hierarchical-Multi-Label Random Forest (HML-RF) model for jointly exploiting heterogeneous visual and tag data modalities, with the aim of creating an intelligent visual machine for automatically organising and managing large scale visual databases.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proposed new forest model, which is defined by a new information gain function, enables naturally incorporating tag abstractness hierarchy and effectively exploiting multiple tag statistical correlations, beyond modelling the intrinsic interactions between visual and tag modalities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">With the learned HML-RF, we further derive a generic clustering pipeline for global group structure discovery and three tag completion algorithms for local instance-level tag concept structure recovery.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Extensive comparative evaluations have demonstrated the advantages and superiority of the proposed approach over a wide range of existing state-of-the-arts clustering, multi-view embedding and tag completion models, particularly in cases where only sparse tags are accessible.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Further, a detailed model component examination is provided for casting insights on our modelling principles and model robustness.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In addition to the above two applications, our HML-RF model can potentially benefit other related problems, such as retrieval and manifold ranking.</a>
