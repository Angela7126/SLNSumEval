<a href="#0" id="0">Our contributions are eight fold.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First, we have identified the inadequacy of ParSBDS in pruning symmetric solutions with respect to LexLeader.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on this observation, second, we propose ReSBDS which can utilize symmetry breaking constraints' information to break extra symmetry compositions with low overhead.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Third, we give formally the time complexity, soundness and termination of ReSBDS and theoretical comparisons against ParSBDS, LexLeader, DoubleLex, SnakeLex and LDSB.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Fourth, ReSBDS is shown to be complete to break all interchangeable variables (values) given only generators when the variable (value) ordering is fixed.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Fifth, we also propose a light version of ReSBDS, LReSBDS, which can break extra symmetry compositions without recording assignments, and thus has lower overhead than ReSBDS.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Sixth, we give formally the soundness and termination of LReSBDS and theoretical comparisons against ReSBDS, ParSBDS, LexLeader, DoubleLex, SnakeLex and LDSB.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Seventh, LReSBDS is also shown to be complete to break all interchangeable variables (values) given only generators when the variable (value) ordering is fixed.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Eighth, we demonstrate empirically the efficiency of ReSBDS and LReSBDS against state of the art static and dynamic methods via extensive experimentation.</a>
