<a href="#0" id="0">We have studied defeasible beliefs in a modal variant of the situation calculus.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The first-order language takes after Lakemeyer and Levesque's epistemic situation calculus, but replaces the notion of indefeasible knowledge with the more expressive concept of conditional belief.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Only-believing allows for representing all that is conditionally believed; it thus generalizes Levesque's only-knowing to the case of beliefs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Newly obtained information is incorporated by two classical belief revision schemes, namely natural or lexicographic revision, and is thus itself defeasible as well.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Introspection of beliefs and quantifying-in both work as expected.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Meanwhile, the stratified-possible-worlds semantics is relatively simple and easy to work with compared to other approaches.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The unique-model property of only-believing also contributes to simplicity of the formalism.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Within this framework, we investigated the belief projection problem for Reiter-style basic action theories, and gave solutions by regression as well as by progression.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As for future work, a very interesting problem is when and how belief progression is first-order definable.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The particular challenge is to capture the revision of a conditional knowledge base without second-order logic.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For natural revision we have already presented a first-order representation in [11].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Whether this is possible for lexicographic revision remains open.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Another avenue of future work is to investigate other belief revision operators.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Particularly revision operators using Spohn's ranking functions [34] seem challenging because of their use of arithmetic.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The main goal of this work is to integrate this theory into a practical reasoning system.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">While its first-order nature prohibits implementing of the full theory, we are currently working towards a limited-belief version, which retains the first-order features but sacrifices completeness to make reasoning decidable.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The system is based on the theory of limited conditional belief in [22] and the reasoner from [23].</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We hope to use this system for epistemic planning in robotics.</a>
