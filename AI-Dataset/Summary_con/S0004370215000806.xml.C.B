<a href="#0" id="0">We have presented a new Constraint Programming model for Constrained Clustering.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This model is a significantly improved version of our previous model within the Constraint Programming framework [3].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is based on a different choice of variables and constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This model is modular in the sense that dedicated global constraints are developed for different optimization criteria.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is more flexible since the number of clusters does not need to be specified; it is sufficient to provide bounds on the number of clusters.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It is declarative and general since it allows to choose among different optimization criteria and to integrate various kinds of user constraints.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show that thanks to its properties, it can be directly integrated in more general processes, as for instance for handling bi-criterion constrained clustering.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Experiments on classical datasets show that our model outperforms existing exact approaches in most cases.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We do believe that working on search strategies and on constraint propagation enables to improve substantially the efficiency of the approach.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We continue studying these aspects to make the model able to deal with larger datasets.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We also investigate the use of approximate search strategies, such as local search methods.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The use of our model for bi-criterion split-diameter constrained clustering can be generalized to other bi-criterion problems, the only requirement is that each single criterion must be integrated inside the model.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">From the Data Mining point of view, we consider integrating other optimization criteria, as for instance the within-cluster sum of squares.</a>
