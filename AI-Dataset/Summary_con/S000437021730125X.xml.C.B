<a href="#0" id="0">We considered the problem of selecting an optimal subset of the experts so as to ensure a certain target accuracy for each task.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We proposed a novel framework, Assured Accuracy Bandit (AAB) and developed an algorithm, Strategic Constrained Confidence Bound (CCB-S) for the same, which also leads to an ex-post incentive compatible and ex-post individually rational mechanism.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have provided bounds on the number of exploration steps that depends on the target accuracy level and the true qualities.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Often, the optimization problem to be solved for each task inherently has exponential time complexity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In most cases, there exist efficient approximate algorithms for solving the optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If these algorithms are monotone, then the algorithms can be combined with CCB-S algorithm to provide a truthful, IR mechanism.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An interesting line of future research could be to improve the convergence rate of CCB-S.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The slow convergence of CCB-S can be attributed to the algorithm being exploration separated.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If there exists a structure to the algorithm for solving the combinatorial optimization problem, then some strategy for eliminating experts in the strategic setting can be adapted.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We have seen a strategy in one example.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A generalization of this to all possible optimization problem may require more assumption on the function {a mathematical formula}fS(q) and forms an interesting future direction.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Working with soft constraint formulation of this problem forms another extension for the future.</a>
