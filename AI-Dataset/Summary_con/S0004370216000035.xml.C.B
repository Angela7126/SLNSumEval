<a href="#0" id="0">The practical success of SAT solvers motivates their use in solving both decision and function problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Many of these function problems are in {a mathematical formula}FPNP but a more accurate query complexity characterization is not known.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For propositional formulas, this is the case, for example, with computing an MUS (for CNF formulas) (e.g. [34], [10]), computing the backbone (e.g. [36], [7]), identifying the set of independent variables (e.g. [30]), or computing prime implicants/implicates, among many others.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This article studies the query complexity of function problems with a constant number of minimal sets, and shows that, if these problems can be represented with monotone predicates in certain general forms, then they are in {a mathematical formula}FPNP[wit,log], i.e. the class of function problems solved in polynomial time by using at most a logarithmic number of calls to a witness oracle [18], [19].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The main consequence of this result is that a large number of well-known function problems are shown to be solved with a logarithmic number of calls to a witness oracle.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These include computing the backbone of a propositional formula, the set of independent variables of a propositional formula, computing an MUS when there exist a constant number of MUSes, and also computing prime implicants (given a term) and prime implicates (given a clause), again when there exist a constant number.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A number of future research directions can be envisioned.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First, it is open whether the results for monotone predicates of form {a mathematical formula}P can be improved upon.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This would have key consequences in long-standing open problems, e.g. computing an MUS [10].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Second, although the worst-case query complexity results in this article improve significantly what practical algorithms have achieved for several function problems, it would be important to also investigate lower bounds on query complexity.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A potential avenue of research in this aspect would be to investigate the relation to other witness/advice-based complexity classes and use existing results for them (see also Remark 3).</a>
