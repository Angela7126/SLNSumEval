<a href="#0" id="0">Although automated planning has been very successful in developing search techniques in abstract “preconditions-and-effects” state-transition spaces, these achievements have not had as much application impact as one might desire.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our analysis of this situation stresses several issues that others have previously recognized:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">“preconditions-and-effects” operators remain too abstract to model concrete actions adequately; there is more to deliberate action than just planning; it is important to address in a systematic and integrative way the problems involved with acting deliberately, which remains one of the main objectives of AI.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper we have advocated a focus on the design and development of actors, as opposed to planners, executors or other enablers that an actor may use to perform its activities.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our two motivating examples, in service robotics and management of a large facility, illustrate how relevant the actorʼs viewpoint is for most planning applications.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In summary, our proposed focus entails two principles:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hierarchically organized deliberation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This principle goes beyond existing hierarchical planning techniques; its requirements and scope are significantly different.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The actor performs its deliberation online; it requires heterogeneous models and mappings to perform refinements into finer-grained state spaces and action spaces.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Methods and tools are needed to support the construction of models and mappings and the run-time reasoning.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Continual planning and deliberation.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The actor monitors, refines, extends, updates, changes and repairs its plans throughout the acting process, using both descriptive and operational models of actions.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Ways are needed to acquire and verify these models, automatically extend them so that the actor can operate in an open environment, and do monitoring and goal reasoning.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We believe the time is ripe for the change of focus that we are advocating.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We hope this paper will be useful in helping readers to understand the need for this change and the pressing problems to be addressed.</a>
