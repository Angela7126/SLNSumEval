<a href="#0" id="0">The partner units problem has many industrial application areas and different versions of the problem have been formulated, most importantly the partner units decision problem (PUDP) and the partner units optimization problem (PUOP).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The PUOP constitutes a hard benchmark problem for the answer set programming competitions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From a practical point of view, though, the partner units decision problem (PUDP) treated herein must be considered as more important than the PUOP.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, whereas for the PUOP complexity is known in its most general form and also for many industrially important subproblems, the complexity of the PUDP was widely unknown.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this article we show that the PUDP in its general form is NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We furthermore show that the PUDP remains NP-complete when the IUCAP problem parameter is fixed to some natural number ≥ 3 and the UCAP problem parameter is fixed to some natural number ≥ 2.</a>
