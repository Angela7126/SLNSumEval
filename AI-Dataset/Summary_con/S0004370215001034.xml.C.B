<a href="#0" id="0">We have shown how semantic relations between entities can be learned in an entirely unsupervised way, based on a relevant text corpus.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The central idea is that we can induce a conceptual space from this text corpus, such that spatial relations in the conceptual space correspond to semantic relations between the entities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Whereas existing approaches have mostly used such learned spatial representations for measuring similarity, we have looked at betweenness and interpretable directions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have also showed how these semantic relations can be used to implement classifiers based on well-known patterns of commonsense reasoning, especially interpolation and a fortiori reasoning.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Experimental results have demonstrated that these classifiers can outperform standard methods such as SVMs, k-NN, and C4.5.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Through a number of crowdsourcing experiments, we have provided further support for the usefulness of the derived semantic relations, for describing the relation between two entities, for generating intuitive explanations of classification decisions, and for merging different taxonomies.</a>
