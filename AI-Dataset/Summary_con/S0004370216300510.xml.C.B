<a href="#0" id="0">This paper discussed a solution to the challenging problem of formally describing a particular characteristic of flexible objects such as strings: their capacity of making loops that can be used (and reasoned about) as holes in spatial reasoning processes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This solution resolves two issues left open in our previous work (reported in [11]), namely, the representation of states where a holed object partially crosses another hole and the creation of string loops.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we have described the identification of string loops in lists of string crossings, together with the actions related to the creation and unwinding of string loops.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In possession of these actions, the framework in [11] can now be used to reason about spatial puzzles where the manipulation of loops is an essential part of the solution.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Future research shall be conducted mainly in two fronts: the consideration of actions related to winding (and unwinding) knots and the deployment of these ideas in real application domains.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The latter may include tasks such as autonomous needle steering or the actual manipulation of (and reasoning about) real world objects by a humanoid robot, such as the Darpa Robotics Challenge{sup:6} that has as one of its goals the implementation of a humanoid robot with the “ability to manipulate and use a diverse assortment of tools designed for humans”.</a>
