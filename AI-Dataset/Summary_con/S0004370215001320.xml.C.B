<a href="#0" id="0">Correctly identifying human activities is a challenging task for the robotics community, but its solution is very important due to it is the first step toward more natural humanâ€“robot interaction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this study we proposed a method for extracting the meaning of basic human activities by combining hand motion information and two object properties.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This information is used as an input by our framework and the output is the inferred human activity, which can be executed by a robotic system in real-time.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We described the proposed method for generating semantic rules from human observations, which we tested under different constraints.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Overall, the results suggest that the best accuracy was obtained by our system with an accuracy classification of 92%, whereas the worst was obtained by a human labeling another human with 74.62%.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This demonstrates that our approach can find rules to generalize basic human activities.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, we developed a new (meaningful) method that allows the extraction of semantic representations, which can be used to transfer skills to humanoid robots.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By adding new capabilities to the reasoning engine, we showed that it could compute new relationships between objects and activities, thereby improving the dynamic growth of the knowledge base in a meaningful manner, which is necessary because we cannot guarantee that knowledge stored manually in the system will be valid under different constraints/scenarios.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We found that the activities followed predefined plans and that these plans could be obtained from the semantic representations proposed in the present study.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Another important characteristic of our system is that inference rules obtained can be implemented in systems such as humanoid robots to allow more natural interactions with human.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Therefore, these semantic rules could enhance the planning process for robotic systems.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The main contributions to this study are summarized as follows.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Proposal and implementation of a multilevel framework that allows the flexible imitation of human behaviors based on observations.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Definition of a new method for obtaining semantic rules that capture the essence of human activities.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The dynamic growth of the ontology-based knowledge representation was improved by using the semantic rules in the reasoning engine.</a>
