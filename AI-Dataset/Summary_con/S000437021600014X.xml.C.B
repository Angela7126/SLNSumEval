<a href="#0" id="0">In this work we have studied partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with a set of target states and costs associated to transitions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first establish an undecidability result for the case of integer costs, where we show that approximating the optimal cost is undecidable for all {a mathematical formula}ϵ>0 both for additive and multiplicative approximations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the case of positive costs we show that the approximation problems are decidable both for additive and multiplicative approximations and propose an algorithm that given {a mathematical formula}ϵ>0 computes a strategy that is ϵ-optimal.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We show that the algorithm may require time double exponential in the number of states in the POMDP and we present a family of POMDPs where double exponential time is required.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We present an efficient stopping criterion and experimentally show that the algorithm is efficient on a number of well-known examples from the literature.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, for the exact decision problems, both for positive as well as integer costs, undecidability is easily derived from the existing results in the literature.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An interesting direction of future work would be to explore whether our approach could be generalized to other models such as Decentralized POMDPs (Dec-POMDPs).</a>
