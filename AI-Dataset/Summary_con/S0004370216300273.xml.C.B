<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we introduced abstract modules and abstract modular systems and showed that they provide a framework capable of capturing diverse logics and inference mechanisms integrated into modular knowledge representation systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, we showed that propositional theories and logic programs can be expressed as abstract inference modules, and that collections of propositional theories and logic programs can be represented as abstract modular systems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Even more importantly, we showed that satisfiability modulo theories can be translated to and studied in the language of abstract modular systems, too, thus demonstrating a broad scope of applicability of our formal framework.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Next, we showed that transition graphs determined by modules and modular systems provide an elegant and effective unifying representation of model generating algorithms, or solvers, and simplify reasoning about such issues as correctness or termination.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our discussion of inference learning identified two types of learning relevant to computing models of modular systems â€” local and global.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The former corresponds to learning studied before in SAT and SMT and shown both theoretically and practically to be essential for good performance.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The latter, the global learning, is a new concept that arises in the context of modular systems.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It concerns learning across modules and, as local learning, promises to lead to performance gains.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the future, we will conduct a systematic study of global learning and its impact on solvers for practical multi-logic formalisms.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The paper provides evidence that abstract inference modules, abstract modular systems and their transition graphs can be useful in theoretical studies of solver properties, and in the development of solvers for modular systems that combine theories from different logic formalisms.</a>
