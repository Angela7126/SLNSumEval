<a href="#0" id="0">As can be seen from this review, the development of logical models of legal reasoning nowadays proceeds mostly within AI & law and is very much driven by real examples and applications.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We think that the latter is a fortunate development, since it shows that the law is a rich testbed for AI theories of reasoning and argument.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We refer the reader to [22] for a recent case study in which four AI models of argumentation and reasoning are applied to the reconstruction of an actual case, the Popov v. Hayashi case, in which two American baseball fans sued each other for ownership of a baseball hit into the stands when Barry Bonds hit his 500th homerun.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In our opinion, AI can learn several things from the AI & law work on logic.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To start with, legal practice shows that the central notion in legal reasoning is not deduction but argument.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Moreover, legal applications of AI models of argumentation show that abstract models of argumentation have only modest usefulness.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the end it is not arguments but claims, grounds, reasons, inferences and conclusions that are important.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Argument schemes (in some approaches formalised as schemes for defeasible rules) turned out to be useful as a bridge between human and computational modes of argument.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For these reasons almost every legal application of Dung's work combines it with an explicit account of the structure of arguments and the nature of attack and defeat, and we think that the same should happen in other domains.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We also argued that ‘traditional’ rule-based nonmonotonic logics (whether argumentation-based or not) are of limited use, and that the role of cases, principle, purpose and value should not be ignored, as well as the importance of dynamics, procedure and multi-agent interaction.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This holds for the law but also for related areas such as policy making, group decision making and democratic deliberation.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">More generally, legal applications of logic confirm the recent trend of widening the scope of logic from deduction to information flow, argumentation and interaction.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The logical study of the law can, of course, also learn from AI and to a large extent it has already done so far, witness the many legal applications of AI models of reasoning and argument that we have reviewed.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">However, much more could be learned from AI.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We end with listing some of the most interesting open problems.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As for knowledge representation, an important issue is the logical representation of small-scale procedures.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The law often prescribes sequences of actions which must be followed to achieve a certain effect, such as application procedures, complaint procedures, elections, audit procedures, trade procedures, customs procedures and so on.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Logical specifications of such procedures could promote computational applications of law ‘in the small’, such as in e-commerce, e-government or e-democracy.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Another important topic is reasoning about causality, agency and responsibility.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">These notions are very important in legal reasoning but have not been studied very much in law and logic or AI & law.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Pioneering studies were carried out by Åqvist [17], [18] but this work was never taken up by others.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Work in general AI like that of [48], [47] may be very relevant here.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">At the end of Section 3 we already mentioned the need to study other forms of interpretative legal argument, such as theory construction, coherence arguments, and policy arguments with degrees of promotion or demotion of values.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">When arguments provide presumptive instead of deductive support for their conclusion, the combined effect of several arguments pro and con the conclusion becomes important.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">In this case an argument could be defeated by several arguments in combination, even though each is individually weaker.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">At present, no argumentation model gives a fully satisfactory general account of this phenomenon.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Some preliminary work exists (e.g. [129]) but there is much more to be done.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">A very important topic is developing models of legal proof that are rationally well-founded but respect the practical and cognitive constraints faced by judges, prosecutors and lawyers in trials.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Among other things, this raises the issue of the relation between qualitative and probabilistic models of evidential reasoning in a practically important context.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">We hypothesise that a ‘tool box’ approach may be best, with a suite of argumentative, narrative and probabilistic tools plus heuristics for how they can best be applied and combined.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">If successful, this research would be not only theoretically but also practically significant, given the current public debate in several countries about the quality of fact finding in criminal trials [53].</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Finally, much research can be done on strategic and heuristic aspects of legal argument.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Above we sketched several initial studies, such as [99]'s heuristics for reformulating case-based arguments and [145]'s game-theoretical analysis of interaction in adjudication debates, but much more can be done.</a>
