<a href="#0" id="0">Although tales of human–computer collaboration are rampant in science fiction, few artifacts seek to combine the best talents of a person and a computer.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">There are at least two plausible reasons for this gap.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, it is easier not to include people in empirical work.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Because people are non-uniform, costly, slow, error-prone, and sometimes irrational, properly designed empirical investigations with them are considerably more complex.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Nonetheless, the ultimate judge of a CI's success must be the person it is intended to assist.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Second, the original vision for AI foresaw an autonomous machine.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We have argued here, however, that a machine that shares a task with a person requires all the behaviors the Dartmouth proposal targeted, plus one more — the ability to collaborate on a common goal.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">At this point in AI's development, it is constructive to re-evaluate the significance of difficult tasks and human simulation.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Just because an artifact can do something very difficult does not make it useful to people.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Although it may be enjoyable to watch an AI program clash wits with a person, collaborative artifacts would be both considerably more useful and better able to attract societal support.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Moreover, just because a computer can be engineered to do something as well as a person may not be a good enough reason to have the computer do it.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">A CoBot, for example, could be engineered to press elevator buttons, but it would then require arm-like appendages that might complicate its ability to maneuver past people and other CoBots in narrow passageways.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Rather than re-design our world for computers or submit to their decisions, we should begin to share our tasks with them.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Indeed, recent evidence suggests that access to technology like the Web and Wikipedia actually contributes positively to human decision making [27].</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">“We think,” read the Dartmouth manifesto, “that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.” It will assuredly take us longer to produce CIs that respond in real time and learn to support human endeavors.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">AI has already spawned subfields that address key CI issues.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Now CI offers us the opportunity to reunite these productive but isolated research communities.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">CI integrates multiple sensory modalities with what we know about intelligent software agents, human–computer interfaces, knowledge and evidence, learning, and metareasoning.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Successful CIs could establish a synergy between people and computers to accomplish human goals.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Computers would do what they do best (or what people would prefer not to do at all), while people would reserve to themselves the ability to set priorities and to deal with the plethora of unforeseen situations that arise in a shared, dynamic world.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">A new focus on artificial intelligence that collaborates with people would incorporate and ultimately strengthen the advances AI has already made, improve AI's public image, and provide AI researchers with a host of interesting and productive challenges.</a>
