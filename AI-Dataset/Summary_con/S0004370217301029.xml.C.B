<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we presented a new approach for the enhancement of operator performance in multi-robot environments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our extensive empirical study, with over 150 human subjects in the warehouse operation and search and rescue environments, both in simulation and real deployment, shows that intelligent agents are able to significantly enhance the performance of operators in complex multi-robot environments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our methodology can accommodate future advancements in robotics hardware and algorithms and is not restricted to a certain type or quantity of robots in the environment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Despite enduring high uncertainty and noisy signals, operators manage to take advantage of the agents' advice and translate them into a better performance than their baseline scores, demonstrating the benefit of our agents and approach.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We conclude that the use of automated advising agents in robotics, and especially in multi-robot environments, is essential in bringing about better performance in real-world applications and enabling operators to control a larger number of robots simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We intend to expand our proposed methodology and use the insights provided in this article to design and implement repeated-interaction agents.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These agents could learn from previous interactions with the operator and tailor an advising policy for her.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As part of this work we will examine the operator modeling for multiple interactions and the ability to deduce insights from one environment to another.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Proceeding on a different path, we are currently working on adapting our methodology to help operators in more complex environments where robots engage in different tasks simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For example, a part of the robot team is performing a patrolling task while the other performs a SAR task.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">One interesting aspect, in this case, is to allow the human operator to indicate her preferences on trade-offs between the tasks, allowing the agent to reason over a number of tasks simultaneously and thus make its recommendations more suitable for the operator.</a>
