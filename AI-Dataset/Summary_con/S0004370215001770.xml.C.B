<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we proposed a new inference algorithm, the structural interface algorithm, for Dynamic Bayesian Networks based on knowledge compilation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This algorithm improves on the state-of-the-art because it (1) uses the repeated nature of the model, (2) exploits local structure, and (3) reduces the size of the resulting circuit.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This approach can tackle dynamic models that are considerably more complex than what can currently be dealt with by exact inference techniques.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have experimentally shown this on two classes of problems, namely finding failures in an electronic circuit and performing filtering in the mastermind game.</a>
