<a href="#0" id="0">This paper extends recent work [25], [26], [107] on monotone predicates and shows that a large number of function problems defined on Boolean formulae can be reduced to computing a minimal set over a monotone predicate.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Besides Boolean formulae, the paper argues that monotone predicates find application in more expressive domains, including ILP, SMT and CSP.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A number of research directions can be envisioned.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A natural question is to identify other function problems that can be reduced to the MSMP problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Algorithms for MSMP are described elsewhere [107].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Another natural research question is whether additional algorithms can be developed.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In addition, most practical algorithms for solving minimal set problems exploit a number of practical optimizations to reduce the number of oracle queries [11], [107], [103].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Another natural research question is whether these practical optimizations can be used in the more general setting of MSMP.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, another line of research is to develop precise query complexity characterizations of instantiations of the MSMP, with [106], [70] representing initial work.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Concrete examples of interest include FMUS, FPIc, FPIt, FBB, FVInd, among others.</a>
