<a href="#0" id="0">The competence group model is inadequate and deficient.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have consequently proposed and defined a competence closure model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This study conducts a theoretical study on the competence group model, and finds that it does not guarantee a complete splitting of the case-base into several competence groups (inadequacy), nor does it guarantee that any two competence groups are mutually independent (deficiency).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This research defines a competence closure model to overcome these problems and reveals the essential differences between these two models.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It also identifies three important aspects of the competence closure model which the competence group model does not possess: 1) the competence closure model is able to uniquely model the entire case-base; 2) the competence closure model provides a smaller granularity than the competence group model; 3) competence closure is the maximum set concerning a series of related problems and two competence closures are said to be independent in terms of the related set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Concept drift can also reflect on competence measurement.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We have presented a method to detect concept drift via competence models which requires no prior knowledge of distribution but measures it through a competence model.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The competence-based change detection method can be applied to CBR systems, where new cases are available sequentially over time.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Empirical experiments report three advantages of our proposed competence-based change detection method: 1) a high achieved detection rate, 2) robustness on small sample size, and 3) ability to quantify and describe the changes it detects, which makes it highly suitable for handling local concept drift problems.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We have found that the competence-based empirical weight provides a rough estimation of the competence distribution of the cases.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Our next attempt will aim to provide a more reliable competence distribution through fuzzy probability theory.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Another improvement may be achieved by drawing a sample that contains no duplicates in the permutation test, as proven by Opdyke [60].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Finally, this paper is part of our work in handling concept drift problems in CBR.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Successive case base editing methods and metric learning methods that take advantage of change detection are needed to improve the final learning performance.</a>
