<a href="#0" id="0">We have the described the logics of implicit, explicit, and speculative knowledge, related modal equivalence in these logics to different forms of bisimulation, compared their expressivity, and provided sound and complete axiomatizations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A follow-up study under preparation will focus on the dynamic aspects that have been left out of this investigation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have various conjectures on the complexity of our logics, but we also leave this for future research.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, the embedding of the logic of speculative knowledge into bisimulation quantified logic not only shows that it is decidable but also gives a non-elementary upper bound of complexity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The lower bound is unclear.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As multi-agent logics of knowledge go, it is certainly PSPACE-hard.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, the actual complexity may well be non-elementary kâˆ’EXP in the knowledge depth.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If that is the case, then, given that speculative knowledge operators are bisimulation quantifiers, the complexity of model checking may unfortunately also be non-elementary.</a>
