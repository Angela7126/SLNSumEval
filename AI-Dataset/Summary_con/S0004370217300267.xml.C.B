<a href="#0" id="0">These examples show that Lakatos-style reasoning can be used to describe real world examples of mathematical conversations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is also clear that there are reasoning steps involved that are not classically Lakatosian, for instance surrounding the clarification of terminology rather than concepts (in Thread 3 (g–h)).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The relationship between the overall game and a sub-game like the one in Thread 3 (a–c) is not formally specified in our protocol, although it would not be difficult to do so [116].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In some cases, a more detailed analysis might yield further insights into the discussants' thought process.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, consider Turns 14–17 in Thread 14, which comprise a more complex exchange than would be needed if the only goal was to introduce a lemma.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Nevertheless, the overall structure of the discussion is coherent with the Lakatosian framework.</a>
