<a href="#0" id="0">Causal ordering inference is a classical problem in the AI literature, and still relevant in light of modern applications [3], e.g., large-scale hypothesis management and analytics [8].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this note we have shown that Simon's classical algorithm (COA) tries to address an NP-Hard problem; and then we have given a detailed account on the state-of-the-art algorithms for the causal ordering problem (COP, stated as Problem 1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The key points are:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, we know (an original hardness result) that Simon's approach to COP requires solving an NP-Hard problem;</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From the seminal work of Simon [1] (cf.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">§2) and Nayak [4] (cf.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">§4, and Proposition 2, Proposition 3), an approach is conveyed to solve COP efficiently;</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By Corollary 2, we know how to process a complete structure into a total causal mapping in time that is bounded by {a mathematical formula}O(|V|⋅|S|).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is a core step to solve COP, which Simon's COA in turn makes intractable.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">By Remark 1, we know how to extract the causal ordering of a complete structure in time {a mathematical formula}O(|V|⋅|S|), that is, in sub-quadratic time on the structure density (number of variable appearances).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The machinery of causal ordering is then suitable for processing very large structures.</a>
