<a href="#0" id="0">A key obstacle when applying relational machine learning and ILP techniques to complex domains is that the basic operations like subsumption have a high computational cost.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We presented a series of theoretical and practical results that allowed us to implement subsumption, antiunification and unification of feature terms using CP.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, we showed how exploiting symmetries in the problem definition greatly improves the performance of our methods.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a result, these operations can be completed more efficiently than using traditional methods.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As part of our future work, we would like to improve our CP models to further increase performance.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The study of more elaborated symmetries seems to be a promising avenue for research.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Additionally, we would like to assess the gain in performance of inductive learning algorithms using our CP-based solutions.</a>
