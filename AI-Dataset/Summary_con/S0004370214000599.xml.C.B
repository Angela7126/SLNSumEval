<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we develop a sparse factorial BP-AR-HMM model that allows for shared dynamic regimes between a variable number of time series, asynchronous regime-switching, and an unknown dictionary of dynamic regimes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Key to our model is capturing the between-series correlations and their evolution with a Markov-switching multivariate innovations process.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For scalability, we assume a sparse dependency structure between the time series using a Gaussian graphical model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This model is inspired by challenges in modeling high-dimensional intracranial EEG time series of seizures, which contain a large variety of smalland large-scale dynamics that are of interest to clinicians.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We demonstrate the value of this unsupervised model by showing its ability to parse seizures in a clinically intuitive manner and to produce state of the art out-of-sample predictions on the iEEG data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, we show how our model allows for flexible, large-scale analysis of different classes of epileptic events, opening new, valuable clinical research directions previously too challenging to pursue.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Such analyses have direct relevance to clinical decision-making for patients with epilepsy.</a>
