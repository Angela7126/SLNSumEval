<a href="#0" id="0">This paper described a novel reduction operation for binary CSP, called BTP-merging, which is strictly stronger than neighbourhood substitution.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Experimental trials have shown that in several benchmark-domains, applying BTP-merging until convergence can significantly reduce the total number of variable-value assignments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We gave a general-arity version of BTP-merging and demonstrated a theoretical link with resolution in SAT.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From a theoretical point of view, we then went on to define a general-arity version of the tractable class defined by the broken-triangle property for a known variable ordering.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our investigation of the interaction of BTP-merging and AllDifferent constraints has shown that the semantics of binary difference constraints can allow us to speed up the search for BTP-merges.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">An interesting avenue of future research is to try to take advantage of the semantics of other types of constraints to speed up the search for BTP-merges.</a>
