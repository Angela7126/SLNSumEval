<a href="#0" id="0">We analyzed stability issues in compact coalitional gamesâ€”i.e., games described via a compact encoding, and equipped with interaction graphs constraining the formation of coalitions among agents according to the model introduced by Myerson [14].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We studied the complexity of interesting computational problems in this setting over various (interaction) graph structures, and we presented a classification based on the degree of the nodes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, positive complexity results have been obtained for graph structures, such as trees and cycles, that form the backbone of networks found in the real world.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our results can serve as indications for the tractability of respective real world coalitional game settings, and could help to design practical solution algorithms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our results are summarized in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">All the entries are either tractability results or hardness results (over marginal contribution networks) for which the corresponding membership result is given (over arbitrary P-representations).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A completeness result is missing only for the CS-LCV{sup:+} problem on arbitrary games over cycles and bounded treewidth interaction graphs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Other avenues of research naturally include the study of further classes of interaction graphs (for instance, of classes of graphs having bounded vinewidth, a notion generalizing treewidth and recently introduced by [73] to analyze the cost of stability), and the study of hypergraph-based representations and restrictions (see, e.g., [74]).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Moreover, it would be interesting to study alternative stability concepts and payoff allocation schemes, such as the kernel, the Shapley value, and the nucleolus[28], [75].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In particular, it would be relevant to assess whether solution concepts can be singled out which somewhat satisfy the core constraints and are computationally tractable even if applied over arbitrary interactions graphs.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Yet another avenue for research is the study of approximation algorithms to deal with the problems analyzed in this paper, which would possibly match the inapproximability results that trivially follow from the reductions we exploited to prove the hardness results.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Finally, we also envisage to concretely link our theoretical results to real-world applications.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For instance, virtual power plants corresponding to coalitions of electricity consumers or (potentially heterogeneous) alternative energy producers, present natural paradigms where the grouping of agents is restricted by technical or legal considerations [76].</a>
