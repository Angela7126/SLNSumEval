<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we showed how the social ridesharing (SR) problem can be modelled as a GCCF problem extending the state of the art algorithm for GCCF, i.e., CFSS, to solve it.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our empirical evaluation shows that our approach can lead to a cost reduction for the entire system that reaches the {a mathematical formula}âˆ’36.22% and that our approximate technique can compute solutions for very large systems (i.e., up to 2000 agents) with good quality guarantees (i.e., with a MPR of 1.41 in the worst case).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, we tackled the payment computation aspect associated to SR, by proposing PK, the first approach able to compute kernel-stable payments for systems with thousands of agents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">PK is able to compute payments for 2000 agents in less than an hour and it is 84 times faster than the state of the art in the best case.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, we identify a relationship between the ability of an agent to obtain a high payment and its degree in the social graph.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Future work will look at extending our approach by focusing on the development of an online SR system, motivated by the inherent dynamic nature of realistic ridesharing systems.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this perspective, we aim at the design of a SR model in which agents can join and leave the system over an extended amount of time.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Such a scenario suggests a solution scheme that employs an offline method (e.g., SR-CFSS) at each time step, which possibly adopts heuristics to restrict solutions only to local areas.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Myopic, short-sighted solutions are then avoided by estimating future mobility patterns for the agents, which could be inferred by the history of previous requests.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A further research direction could consider multi-hop ridesharing [19] (not currently used by most existing ridesharing services) for journeys outside the urban scenario.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Finally, in the context of payment computation, we aim at investigating whether recent tractability results on particular network structures [23] could also be applied to the SR scenario.</a>
