<a href="#0" id="0">Under the stable model semantics, two sets of propositional formulas are strongly equivalent if and only if they are equivalent in the logic of here-and-there.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proof of this theorem uses equilibrium logic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we extended equilibrium logic to infinitary formulas; we defined an infinitary counterpart to the logic of here-and-there and introduced an axiomatization, {a mathematical formula}HT∞, of that system; finally, we showed that bounded sets of infinitary propositional formulas are strongly equivalent if and only if they are equivalent in {a mathematical formula}HT∞.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Gebser et al. [12, Section 5] used strong equivalence of infinitary formulas to state several useful properties of aggregate expressions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We expect that this concept will find other applications to the theory of answer set programming.</a>
