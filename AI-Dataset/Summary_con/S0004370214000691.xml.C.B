<a href="#0" id="0">The benefits of selective disclosure of information in mixed auction settings have been well established in prior works, as discussed in the previous section.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The current paper considers the problem in a richer setting, where the availability of the information to the auctioneer is not trivial, but rather the auctioneer needs to decide whether or not she is interested in purchasing it.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Bidders' awareness of the situation complicates the analysis in this case, as it requires the solution to be stable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The analysis given in the paper unfolds the equilibrium structure for such a model and facilitates its calculation for any setting.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, it shows how the problem of the auctioneer or the social planner can be simplified whenever having to reason about the equilibrium, which is likely to hold for any potential price set by the information provider.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The equilibrium-based analysis also facilitates the illustration of several interesting and often somewhat surprising properties of the model, related to the effect of the different model parameters over the auctioneer's expected-benefit in equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Some of them are in contrast to those characterizing traditional auction models (e.g., having more bidders participate in the auction is not necessarily in the auctioneer's best interest, and having less bidders is not necessarily in the bidders' best interest; having the option to purchase the information (at all or at a reduced price) can actually result in a degradation in the auctioneer's expected benefit).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">These results are attributed to the stability requirement – despite the superiority of the situation for the auctioneer (e.g., with the reduced cost of information, the greater number of bidders), the auctioneer's preferable solution cannot hold since the bidders know that if they act according to it, there is an incentive for the auctioneer to deviate.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As for bidders' awareness of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information, the paper demonstrates that such knowledge is not always beneficial in our setting: the auctioneer can potentially benefit from bidders' awareness, and bidders can benefit from being unaware.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This, once again, is attributed to the stability constraint – becoming aware or unaware may lead to a different equilibrium solution, which might turn out to be more beneficial to any of the parties despite the loss due to bidders' awareness (for the auctioneer) or unawareness (for the bidders).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Similarly, the option to purchase the information can have a substantial downside, and indeed the paper demonstrates situations where the existence of such an option leads to a degradation in the auctioneer's expected benefit.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The interest in such a result is because seemingly it is the auctioneer's choice of whether to obtain the information or not.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The explanation of this result is that once the bidders become strategic players, the auctioneer does not really have the flexibility of choosing whether or not to obtain the information.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Instead, the choice of obtaining the information derives from stability considerations.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">One important implication of the above is that the auctioneer may find it beneficial to pay the information-provider to leave the market or not disclose her existence.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Another implication is that a self-interested information-provider may find it beneficial not to publish her existence but rather contact the auctioneer and offer her services discretely.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Finally, the paper shows that in our unique setting, it might be beneficial for the auctioneer to pay an external information-provider in order to change the price she sets for the information (without leaving the market).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Similarly, we demonstrate how a social planner can improve social welfare through subsidy and taxation.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Both means are effective.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In particular, in the case of a tax, the paper uses a strict assumption whereby the proceeds of the taxes are not re-distributed and thus the tax is taken into account as part of the social welfare only in the form of the tax payment that the auctioneer needs to pay.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We note that our model allows only the auctioneer to purchase the external information related to the common value.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">While this is applicable to many settings, for the justifications given in Section 2, there are situations where the auctioneer and bidders are symmetric in their ability to obtain the common value.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Therefore, an important direction for future research is the modeling and analysis of settings where both the auctioneer and the bidders can purchase the external information.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The analysis of such environments is likely to involve several aspects of coalition formation and cooperation among self-interested agents, as the bidders may find it beneficial to cooperate in obtaining the information (either for the purpose of reducing the cost each incurs or as a means of placing pressure on the auctioneer to obtain and disclose it).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The stability in this case will need to be tested also for the bidder coalitions that will be formed.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Furthermore, the auctioneer may find it beneficial in some cases to split the cost of obtaining the information with the bidders in exchange for committing to disclose the information.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Another natural extension of this work is the analysis of mixed settings where only some of the bidders are aware of the fact that the auctioneer may purchase accurate information on the common value.</a>
