<a href="#0" id="0">We believe the time is ripe for AI and Robotics to pursue conjoint research lines towards an integrated approach for autonomous systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Doing so will enable a new cohort of young researchers who have a wider field of view over the two disciplines, and can make progress towards truly embodied agents by leveraging what is now cross-disciplinary into their curriculum and removing the traditional ‘stove piping’ that often occurs in academia.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">And ideally to do so for societal benefit in the context of understanding how we can alleviate some of today's problems afflicting humankind.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One grand challenge might be in harnessing and applying research towards helping understand the environment and provide tools and techniques in understanding the changing climate.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This would need AI and Robotics to aid researchers in the pure (and social) sciences to obtain a finer level understanding of earthbound environmental processes, e.g., harmful algal blooms in the oceans, air pollution in cities and towns, the carbon life-cycle, etc.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Such a task would require embodiment in sensors and robotic platforms exposed to the harsh conditions terrestrially, in the atmosphere, in the oceans and in space while providing novel means of measuring critical scientific variables, all the while interacting with researchers well outside the traditional comfort zone of technologists.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To enable such grand challenges requires focus and concerted action with a well thought out research agenda.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">One approach that has been suggested is to define a list of problem statements for integrated AI and Robotics [39].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A complementary, applied approach could define competitive challenges[40] in the style of RoboCup [35] or the DARPA initiatives [41], [42].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Irrespectively, we expect that many of the research questions that will arise lie at the intersection of the rows and columns in the matrix shown in Fig. 1.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The solutions to these questions would provide a core set of principles, methods and approaches, from which a curriculum can be built that defines the new science of integrated AI and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">These could also be collected in a compendium of methods and techniques developed by this emerging community of scholars and updated continuously with community-driven tools.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The periodic publication of a collected ‘Readings’, akin to [43] and [44], could be instrumental in helping young (or even well-established) researchers get a bird's eye view of this nascent field.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This Special Issue is essentially the first of many steps that we believe are needed to get AI and Robotics to be more aligned and co-mingled with ideas, techniques and methods, formal and otherwise.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For these disciplines to make a clear and positive impact to society, we believe there are no boundaries: collective wisdom can only come with collective action.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">And we believe this is the time to pull together an effective community in this field.</a>
