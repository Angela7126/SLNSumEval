<a href="#0" id="0">We have introduced ASlib, a benchmark library for algorithm selection, a rapidly growing field of research with substantial impact on various sub-communities in artificial intelligence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">ASlib facilitates research on algorithm selection methods by providing a common set of benchmarks and tools for working with these.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Similar to solver competitions, it enables principled comparative empirical performance assessment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It also considerably lowers the otherwise rather high barrier for researchers to work on algorithm selection, since anyone using the benchmark scenarios we provide does not have to perform actual runs of the solvers contained in them.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since our library provides performance data for the solvers and problem instances included in each selection scenario, using ASlib also substantially reduces the computational burden of performance assessments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Otherwise, these data would have to be produced, at considerable computational cost, by anyone working with that scenario.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We carefully selected the set of scenarios included in release version 2.0 of ASlib to challenge algorithm selection methods in various ways and thus provide a solid basis for developing and assessing such methods.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Release version 2.0 of the library contains 17 algorithm selection scenarios from six different areas with a focus on (but not a limitation to) constraint satisfaction problems.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We discussed the format of new algorithm selection scenarios and showed examples of the automated exploratory data analysis that will run for each new scenario submitted to our online platform http://aslib.net/.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, exploratory studies with various algorithm selection approaches demonstrated the performance that algorithm selection systems can achieve on our scenarios.</a>
