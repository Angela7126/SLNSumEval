<a href="#0" id="0">Our work offers three different but related perspectives on utilitarian social choice.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each model makes fundamentally different assumptions about the mechanism's knowledge of the agents' utility information.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the worst-case model, we study the distortion of randomized social choice functions assuming no information about the underlying utilities.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the average-case model, we derive the optimal social choice function with respect to distributions that are i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">and neutral.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, in the learning-theoretic model, we develop a method for approximately optimizing (scoring-based) social choice functions under arbitrary utility distributions, establish sample complexity bounds and provide encouraging empirical results.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our work raises a number of important questions and directions for future research.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Access to sampled utility profiles, as assumed in our learning-theoretic model, may be difficult to obtain in practice.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, techniques from decision analysis and preference elicitation using lotteries, or more readily comprehensible queries involving simple comparisons, can be used to assess the utility functions of specific agents [9], while econometric techniques often use revealed preference or stated choice data to develop probabilistic models of utilities [20].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Applying these methods to the design of optimal (ranking-based) social choice functions is an important direction for future work.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">One of our motivations is to reduce the cognitive and communication burden associated with utilities or valuations by allowing the agents to specify rankings.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This burden can be further reduced by intelligent elicitation of partial ranking information [19], [22].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Our utilitarian model offers a novel perspective on vote elicitation and raises the possibility of designing schemes that perform well with respect to utilitarian social welfare.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The utilitarian perspective also suggests new ways of assessing the potential manipulation of social choice functions.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">By assuming agents have utility functions, and probabilistic information about the utilities of their counterparts, one can quantify the gains of potential misreports in terms of expected utility, providing a Bayesian view of manipulation [23].</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The design of scoring functions that make appropriate trade-offs between degree of optimality and degree of manipulability is another important problem to which our methods may be adapted.</a>
