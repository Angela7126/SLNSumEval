<a href="#0" id="0">Logical inference algorithms for probabilistic conditional independence statements have several important applications from checking consistency during knowledge elicitation to constraint-based structure learning of graphical models [44].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As it is generally known that there does not exist a finite, sound and complete axiomatization for probabilistic conditional independence implication [6], we can try to do the next best thing, which is enclosing the problem between a “lower bound”, that is, a finite set of inference rules that is sound, and an “upper bound”, a finite set of inference rules that is complete.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is well-known that the semi-graphoid axiom system, referred to in this paper as System {a mathematical formula}G is sound (e,g., [40]).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One of the main contributions of the present paper is introducing another finite set of inference rules, System {a mathematical formula}A, which is shown to be complete for the probabilistic implication problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While a sound but not complete finite system of inference rules can always be transformed into a “tighter lower bound” by adding true logical implications that are not provable, an analogous strategy is not obvious for transforming a complete but not sound system of inference rules into a “tighter upper bound”.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It is therefore justified to ask whether System {a mathematical formula}A is in some sense optimal as an “upper bound”.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This is work for future research.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Of course, the above question could in principle be asked about any complete but not sound axiomatization system.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It is therefore important to observe the connection between System {a mathematical formula}A and the lattice-inclusion property, which plays a pivotal role in the present paper.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The theory underlying the present paper is based on a study of the additive implication problem, and, therefore, its scope of applications is much broader than only the probabilistic implication problem.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Other application areas include database constraints, data mining, and reasoning about uncertainty [28], [29], [32], [33].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Within the context of the probabilistic implication problem, the theory is also applicable to other types of (sets of) CI statements, such as stable sets of CI statements [5].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">An important contribution of this paper are the falsification and validation heuristics for the probabilistic implication problem.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">While these heuristics are rooted in the lattice-theoretical framework, the supermodularity of the multi-information function also played a pivotal role in the development of the validation criterion.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, a more thorough study of additive implication with respect to the class of supermodular functions is called for.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Finally, the lattice-inclusion property and the heuristics developed in this paper can be utilized to store information about conditional independencies more efficiently, using non-redundant representations [5].</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This is in line with previous work on more efficient maintenance of conditional independence information [35], [36].</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Overall, we believe that we have convincingly argued that the lattice-theoretic framework for reasoning about conditional independence is a novel and powerful tool.</a>
