<a href="#0" id="0">Human commonsense physical reasoning is strikingly flexible in its ability to deal with radically incomplete problem specifications and incomplete theories of the physics of the situation at hand.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have argued that an appropriate method for achieving this flexibility in an automated system would be to use a knowledge-based system incorporating rules spanning a wide range of specificity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As an initial step, we have formulated some of the axioms that would be useful in reasoning about manipulating containers, and we have shown that these axioms suffice to justify some simple commonsense inferences.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In future work on this project, we plan to expand the knowledge base to cover many more forms of qualitative reasoning about containers, and to expand the collection of commonsense inferences under consideration.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We will also attempt to implement the knowledge base within an automated reasoning system that can carry out the inferences from problem specification to conclusion.</a>
