<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we presented the first comprehensive approach to the problem of weak controllability for TPUs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We cover the problem in its full generality, in the case of TPUs with disjunctions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We work in a logic-based framework, that relies on SMT techniques to achieve an efficient implementation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We make the following contributions: we provide the first effective procedure for deciding the weak controllability of DTPU; we investigate the problem of repeated execution; we propose various constructive forms of strategy extraction.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The experimental evaluation shows the feasibility of the method, and demonstrates dramatic speed ups on explicit over implicit strategy execution.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the future, we will investigate the following research lines.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The “incremental weakening” approach for linear strategy extraction and the “lazy decomposition” approach for piecewise-linear strategy extraction are strongly influenced by the selection heuristics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We will investigate the possibility of using topological information for the generation of effective subsets of {a mathematical formula}y→ in “incremental weakening”, and the use of extremal simplexes in the “lazy decomposition” approach.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We plan to study the applicability to the strategy construction problem of SMT proof-extraction techniques: the capability of modern solvers to extract proofs of unsatisfiability could provide a way to extract the strategy while proving weak controllability.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In addition, determining under which conditions a finite state representation is guaranteed to be applicable, can open the way to more efficient and even hardware-implemented strategies.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Finally, we believe that the techniques we described can pave the way to efficient explicit strategies for dynamic controllability, where strategies are required to rely only on the observation of events that have already occurred.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In particular, we plan to combine the approaches to strong and weak controllability, to explore the continuum in between.</a>
