<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we presented subdimensional expansion, a method for constructing low-dimensional search spaces tailored to specific multirobot path planning problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We implemented subdimensional expansion using {a mathematical formula}A⁎ as the underlying planning algorithm, resulting in the {a mathematical formula}M⁎ algorithm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While the performance of {a mathematical formula}M⁎ and its variants are marginal on fully coupled problems, in the more expansive environments for which {a mathematical formula}M⁎ was designed, {a mathematical formula}M⁎ provides considerable improvements in performance for finding minimal cost paths for multirobot systems compared to the existing state of the art.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, inflated {a mathematical formula}M⁎ can solve large problems involving 200 robots, and produce paths that cost significantly less than those generated by existing rule based planners which can also solve such large problems.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In our future work, we will consider several extensions of subdimensional expansion.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Barer et al. [58] recently published a bounded-suboptimal variant of CBS termed ECBS which can outperform inflated {a mathematical formula}ODrM⁎/EPErM⁎ when small inflation factors are used.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We believe that combining ECBS and inflated {a mathematical formula}EPErM⁎ will result in further performance improvements, similar to the improvements in optimal path planning seen in {a mathematical formula}MA-CBS+ODrM⁎.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Minimal cost paths for multirobot systems often feature robots passing very close to one another.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Minor errors in plan execution can thus result in collisions, or time consuming reactive collision avoidance, which may invalidate the entire plan.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Subdimensional expansion can be extended to account for uncertainty in plan execution by utilizing a collision function which treats each robot as occupying a distribution of possible states.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The collision sets would then track the probability of a collision occurring, with the dimensionality of the search space increased when the probability of a collision rises above some threshold value.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">While subdimensional expansion is currently formatted for multirobot systems, we plan to extend the concept of subdimensional expansion to other high-dimensional systems.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">There are some single robot systems with high-dimensional configuration spaces which can be decomposed into semi-independent subspaces in a similar manner to how multirobot systems can be decomposed into individual robots.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For instance, changing the motion of joints of a robot arm distal to a collision cannot resolve said collision.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The challenge will lie in identifying how a decomposition into largely independent subsystems can be performed for systems without the natural structure of multirobot systems.</a>
