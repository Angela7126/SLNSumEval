<a href="#0" id="0">In this research note we have reviewed and discussed two fundamental topology-related properties of argumentation semantics, namely directionality and SCC-recursiveness and analyzed their relationships with the division-based method proposed in [1].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On this basis, we have corrected an imprecise claim of [1] concerning ideal semantics and provided novel results concerning incremental computation for stable and ideal semantics in a dynamic setting.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Future work directions include the study of further improvements to the division-based method and, more generally, of efficient computational procedures for argumentation semantics exploiting their topology-related properties.</a>
