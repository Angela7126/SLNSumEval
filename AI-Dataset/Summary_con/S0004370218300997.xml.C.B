<a href="#0" id="0">We analyzed the problem of coalition formation with a fixed number of coalitions where, in addition, a central organizer can facilitate new relationships between agents at a certain cost.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We examined this scenario from two aspects: maximizing social welfare and finding core stable solutions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We provided general results, and established that the problem of finding a coalition structure maximizing the social welfare is tractable only when both k and the number of negative edges are constrained.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We provided a polynomial time algorithm in the case of fixed k and nearly positive graphs for computing the optimal coalition structure and the optimal set of edges the organizer should add to the network.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We conducted experiments on 4 sample networks which clearly show the benefits of the proposed algorithm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To further improve the running time of the optimal algorithm, we provided an efficient greedy heuristic.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We showed that even though the performance of the heuristic is unbounded in theory, it is near optimal in practice.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">With respect to core stable solutions, we identified tractable instances and provided polynomial time algorithms for them.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">When a polynomial time algorithm was not available we provided a heuristic for finding a core stable solution.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We also showed that stability may incur a cost in social welfare and that this ratio may be unbounded.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We then proceeded to characterize the problem of facilitating relationships in order to stabilize a coalition structure which is closely related to the cost of stability problem.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Unfortunately this problem proves to be NP-hard.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We foresee a variety of possible extensions of our work.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">First, it would be interesting to consider additional task related aspects.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For example, suppose that there are different skills for the agents, and each task requires a specific subset of skills to be completed.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The combination of a task aspect together with personal relationships will target a very realistic real world scenario [13].</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The challenge would be to define a model that captures all of these aspects without increasing the computational complexity.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Another potential direction is to relax our requirement of exactly k coalitions and consider coalition formation problems where the coalition structure contains at leastk coalitions.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">To eliminate trivial solutions, it is possible that a constraint on the minimal size of a coalition will need to be added.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Lastly, we showed that the k-coalitions-core may be empty if the social network contains positive and negative edges (see Fig. 17).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We conjecture that the k-coalitions-core is always non-empty if the social network does not contain negative edges, but this remains an open question.</a>
