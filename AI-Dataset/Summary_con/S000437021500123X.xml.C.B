<a href="#0" id="0">This paper presented a theory of how a robot can plan to gather information and explain failure in environments that have uncertain sensing, uncertain actions, incomplete information and epistemic goals.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The abstract version of the theory is concerned with the division of knowledge into three types: instance, default, and diagnostic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this three-layer division, knowledge at higher layers is used to modify knowledge at lower layers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The instantiation of the theory presented here relies on several technical innovations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We summarize these now.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The combination of instance and default knowledge allows strong inferences to be drawn from relatively little sensory information.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The joint belief state forms the initial planning state in each planning session, including determination of the success probabilities of several types of action.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The conversion of many different types of knowledge into a single representation allows the use of standard inference methods.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We have described how assumptive planning provides a single mechanism that can be used to solve four problems.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">First, that of planning in the face of uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Second, that of planning in open worlds.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Third, explaining task failure by hypothesizing both new instance knowledge and new default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Fourth, verifying that explanation, by hypothesizing the entities needed to verify the explanations.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This paper has argued that assumptions are particularly useful when combined with default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We see assumptions as an elegant way to solve a significant number of problems in robot task planning.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">One important requirement for making assumptions is that the robot should avoid making unlikely assumptions.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Assigning probabilities to assumptions helps with this, since it gives a principled way to rank sequences of assumptions.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Our solution is for assumption likelihoods to be determined by existing knowledge: either instance knowledge or default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">This means that assumptions are not conjured from thin air.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">It also means that instance assumptions vary according to the changing relational map.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The main contribution of the work is the overall framework for knowledge layering, planning, and state estimation.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">It is the way that the parts of our approach fit together that is as important as any one part.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In the light of this, it is worth reflecting on the open questions that the framework raises, and should be extended to address.</a>
