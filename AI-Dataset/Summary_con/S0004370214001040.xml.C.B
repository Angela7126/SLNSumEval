<a href="#0" id="0">The purpose of this investigation was to introduce a relation on descriptors that has a similar role in descriptor revision as epistemic entrenchment has in AGM contraction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This was achieved in Section 3, whose main result was an interdefinability between on the one hand descriptor revisions based on a linear ordering of belief sets and on the other hand descriptor revisions based on a relation of epistemic proximity on descriptors.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This result is analogous to the interdefinability in AGM between transitively relational partial meet contraction and contraction based on epistemic entrenchment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In Section 4, we restricted our attention to descriptors corresponding to sentential revision, and derived a binary relation (believability) on sentences, based on that restriction.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Section 5, we performed a similar restriction to descriptors corresponding to revocation or contraction, and derived a relation on sentences for that case.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the latter case the derived relation satisfies all the standard properties of epistemic entrenchment.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Based on these results, epistemic proximity can be seen as a generalization of epistemic entrenchment in the sense that all relations of epistemic proximity on descriptors give rise to relations of epistemic entrenchment on sentences.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, the construction of contraction operators is not the same as in the AGM framework.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the present framework, a contraction operator cannot in general be reconstructed from its associated entrenchment relation and, in particular, GÃ¤rdenfors' recipe for deriving contraction from entrenchment is not applicable.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Nevertheless, the appearance of entrenchment relations with the standard properties in a framework quite different from the AGM framework in which these relations were originally developed confirms the importance and generality of these relations.</a>
