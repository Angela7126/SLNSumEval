<a href="#0" id="0">The concept of groundedness is widespread in various logic and knowledge representation domains.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we formalised this as a property of fixpoints of a lattice operator.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In a first step, we analysed grounded fixpoints and their relation to other notions of fixpoints, in particular minimal fixpoints and the different sorts of fixpoints classified in approximation fixpoint theory.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The main results here are: given an operator O and an approximator A of O, all A-stable fixpoints are grounded for O and all grounded fixpoints of O are minimal fixpoints approximated by the A-well-founded fixpoint.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We then investigated groundedness in logic programming, abstract argumentation frameworks, autoepistemic logic and default logic.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In each of these fields, the concept of groundedness had appeared before, although not always under the same name.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We showed links with the notion of unfounded set in logic programming, with groundedness in Dung's argumentation frameworks and various notions of groundedness in autoepistemic logic and default logic.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In each logic, we investigated groundedness of the existing semantics and the new semantics induced by grounded fixpoints.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For example, in the context of argumentation frameworks, we discovered that grounded fixpoints recover two existing semantics.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the more general abstract dialectical frameworks, grounded fixpoint yield a new semantics with a clear informal semantics: a fixpoint is grounded if it contains no self-supporting arguments.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In autoepistemic logic and default logic, groundedness captures intuitions written down by Konolige.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In summary, the main contributions of the presented work are: we presented a generic formalisation of the concept of groundedness, an analysis of groundedness of existing semantics in a range of logics, and last but not least, the definition of the new semantics for operator based logics induced by grounded fixpoints.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In comparison with approximation fixpoint theory, grounded fixpoints are defined directly in terms of the original lattice operator and do not require the invention of an approximator.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Grounded fixpoint semantics is compact, intuitive and applicable to all operator based logics.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Moreover, it is easily extensible.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">When adding new language constructs, it suffices to extend the operator for them.</a>
