<a href="#0" id="0">A new model-based framework for time series interpretation is proposed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This framework relies on some basic assumptions: (i) interpretation of the behavior of a system from the set of available observations is a sort of conjecturing, and as such follows the logic of abduction; (ii) the interpretation task involves both bottom-up and top-down processing of information along a set of abstraction levels; (iii) at the lower levels of abstraction, the interpretation task is a form of precompiled knowledge-based pattern recognition; (iv) the interpretation task involves both the representation of time and reasoning about time and along time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Model-based representation in the present framework is based on the notion of abstraction pattern, which defines an abstraction relation between observables and provides the knowledge and methods to conjecture new observations from previous ones.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let us deepen in both the backward and forward logical meaning of an abstraction pattern, following a reasoning similar to that of [4]:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Backward meaning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">From the backward reading of an abstraction pattern P, a hypothesis h is a possible abstraction of {a mathematical formula}m1,…,mn, provided that the constraints in {a mathematical formula}CP hold.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An abstraction pattern satisfies the compositionality principle of abductive reasoning, and hence an abstraction hypothesis can be conjectured from a single piece of evidence, and new pieces of evidence can be added later [16].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">On the other hand, if there are multiple ways of observing h by means of multiple patterns, and their respective constraints are inconsistent with the evidence, we do not conclude ¬h, interpreted as failure to prove h; we will only conclude ¬h in all those interpretations conjecturing an observation of a different {a mathematical formula}h′, where h and {a mathematical formula}h′ are mutually exclusive.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Forward meaning.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">An abductive observation is built upon an archetypical representation of a hypothesis h, creating an observation as an instance of h by estimating, from the available evidence, its attribute values A and its temporal location {a mathematical formula}Tb and {a mathematical formula}Te by means of an observation procedure {a mathematical formula}ΘP.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">From a forward reading, assuming h is true, there is an observation for each observable of the set {a mathematical formula}m1,…,mn such that the constraints in {a mathematical formula}CP hold.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However, the estimated nature of abstraction does not usually allow us to infer, from the observation of h, the same observations of {a mathematical formula}m1,…,mn that have been abstracted into h. We must presume instead that assuming h is true entails the occurrence of an observation for each observable of {a mathematical formula}m1,…,mn, without necessarily entailing its attribute values and its temporal location.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Both the forward and the backward meanings of an abstraction pattern support the incremental building of an interpretation in the present framework.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Thus, what initially was defined as a set covering problem of a time series fragment – a completely intractable problem as it moves away from a toy example – can be feasibly solved if it is properly structured in a set of abstraction levels, on which four reasoning modes (abduction, deduction, subsumption and prediction) can make a more efficient search of the best explanation under a parsimony criterion.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Moreover, this incremental reasoning primarily follows the time direction, since the available knowledge is usually compiled in the form of a set of processes that can be expected to be found in a certain sequence, which underscores the anticipatory information contained in the evidence.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">An abstraction model, built on a set of abstraction patterns, establishes a causal responsibility for the behavior observed in a complex system [24].</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This responsibility is expressed in the language of processes: a process is said to be observable if it is assumed that it causes a recognizable trace in the physical quantity to be interpreted.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">This notion of causality is behind perception, i.e., concerned with the explanation of sensory data, in contrast with the notion of causality in diagnosis, concerned with the explanation of abnormality [10].</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Representing and reasoning about context is a relevant issue in model-based diagnosis [4], [10], [33], [40].</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">A contextual observation is nothing more than another observation that need not be explained by a diagnosis.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In most of the bibliography, the distinction between these two roles must be defined beforehand.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Several other works enable the same observation to play different roles in different causal patterns, thus providing some general operations for expressing common changes made by the context in a diagnostic pattern [25], [32].</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In the present interpretation framework, an observation can either be part of the evidence to be explained in a certain abstraction pattern, or can be part of the environment in another abstraction pattern.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Both types of observation play a part in the hypothesize-and-test cycle, with the only difference that observations of the environment of an abstraction pattern are not expected to be abstracted by this pattern.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Hence, observations of the environment are naturally included in the deduction, subsumption and prediction modes of reasoning.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">An important limitation of the present framework is its knowledge-intensive nature, requiring a non-trivial elicitation of expert knowledge.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">It is worth exploring different possibilities for the inclusion of machine learning strategies, both for the adaption and the definition of the knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">A first approach may address the automatic adjustment of the initial constraints among recurrent findings in abstraction grammars.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">In this manner, for example, temporal constraints between consecutive heartbeats in a normal rhythm abstraction grammar could be adapted to the characteristics of the subject whose ECG is being interpreted, allowing the identification of possible deviations from normality with greater sensitivity.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">On the other hand, the discovery of new abstraction patterns and abstraction grammars by data mining methods appears as a key challenge.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">In this regard, the CONSTRUE() algorithm should be extended by designing an INDUCE() procedure aimed at conjecturing new observables after an inductive process.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">To this end, new default assumptions should be made in order to define those grammar structures that should rule the inductive process.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">These grammar structures may lead to discovery new morphologies or rhythms not previously included in the knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">The proposed framework formulates an interpretation problem as an abduction problem with constraints, targeted at finding a set of hypotheses covering all the observations while satisfying a set of constraints on their attribute and temporal values.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Thus, consistency is the only criterion to evaluate the plausibility of a hypothesis, resulting in a true or false value, and any evoked hypothesis (no matter how unusual it is) for which inconsistent evidence cannot be found is considered as plausible and, consequently, it will be explored in the interpretation cycle.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Even though this simple approach has provided remarkable results, it can be expected that the inclusion of a hypothesis evaluation scheme, typically based on probability [33], [37] or possibility [13], [32] theories, will allow us to better discriminate between plausible and implausible hypotheses, leading to better explanations with fewer computational requirements.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">The expressiveness of the present framework should also be enhanced to support the representation of the absence of some piece of evidence, in the form of negation, so that ¬q represents the absence of q. The exclusion relation is a first approach to manage with the notion of absence in the hypothesize-and-test cycle, since the occurrence of a process is negated by the concurrent occurrence of any of the processes related to it by the exclusion relation.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">On the other hand, an inhibitory relation can enable us to represent a certain process preventing another from occurring under some temporal constraints, providing a method to insert the prediction of the absence of some observable in the hypothesize-and-test cycle.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Furthermore, other forms of interaction between processes, possibly modifying the respective initial patterns of evidence, should be modeled.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Further efforts should be made to improve the efficiency of the interpretation process.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">To this end, two main strategies are currently being explored.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">In the first strategy, the model structure is exploited to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for every hypothesis to be conjectured; the necessary conditions avoid the expansion of the hypotheses that can be ruled out because they are inconsistent with observations, while sufficient conditions avoid the construction of redundant interpretations [9].</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Another strategy entails additional restrictions in the amount of computer memory and time needed to run the algorithm, resulting in a selective pruning of the node expansion while sacrificing optimality; this strategy is similar to the one used in the K-Beam algorithm [14].</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">The CONSTRUE() algorithm is based on the assumption that all the evidence to be explained is available at the beginning of the interpretation task.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">A new version of the algorithm should be provided to cope with a wide range of problems, where the interpretation must be updated as new evidence becomes available over time.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Examples of such problems are continuous biosignal monitoring or plan execution monitoring [3].</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">At the emergence of a new piece of evidence, two reasoning modes may come into play triggered by the CONSTRUE() algorithm: a new explanatory hypothesis can be conjectured by means of the ABDUCE() procedure, or the evidence can be incorporated in an existing hypothesis by means of the SUBSUME() procedure.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">In this way, the incorporation of new evidence over time is seamlessly integrated into the hypothesize-and-test cycle.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">Furthermore, to properly address these interpretation scenarios, the heuristics used to guide the search must be updated to account for the timing of the interpretation process, which will lead to the definition of a covering ratio until time t, and a complexity until time t.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">Implementation</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">With the aim of supporting reproducible research, the full source code of the algorithms presented in this paper has been published under an Open Source License,{sup:1} along with a knowledge base for the interpretation of the ECG signal strips of all examples in this paper.</a>
