<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we have systematically investigated the computational complexity of redundancy checking for RCC5/8 constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although it is in general intractable, we have shown that a prime subnetwork can be found in {a mathematical formula}O(n5) time for any consistent network over a tractable subclass of RCC5/8.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the constraints are taken from a distributive subalgebra, we proved that the constraint network has a unique prime subnetwork, which can be found in cubic time.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a by-product, we also proved that any path-consistent network over a distributive subalgebra is weakly globally consistent and minimal.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our empirical analysis showed that for real geographic data sets the prime subnetwork can lead to significant increases in the number of redundant relations identified when compared with the approximations proposed by [52].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In practice, the algorithm was efficient, exhibiting average case {a mathematical formula}O(n2) scalability.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The redundant relations identified by the prime subnetwork can also significantly outnumber DC relations, especially in less structured geographic data sets that may contain a significant minority of PO relations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It is worth noting that a large part of our results can be applied to several other qualitative calculi (like PA, IA, CRA, and RA) immediately, but Proposition 27, Proposition 28 and Theorem 29 do use the particular algebraic properties of RCC5/8 (see Table 5 for a summary).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For example, Theorem 29 cannot be applied to IA, because we have an all-different and path-consistent basic IA network which is not equivalent to its core.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Future work will consider how to extend our results to IA, RA and other calculi.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We are also developing further the practical applications of prime subnetworks.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In addition to pursuing a more systematic exploration of the applications to saving storage than the one given in Section 1.1, further work is necessary to investigate other aspects of prime subnetworks, in particular the structure and comparison of different prime subnetworks of sets of footprints.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Another challenging research direction is to develop more efficient reasoning methods for sparse constraint networks other than enforcing path-consistency, which runs in cubic time and always turns a sparse constraint network into a complete one.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The method initiated in [47] seems very promising.</a>
