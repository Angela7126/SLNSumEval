<a href="#0" id="0">We have provided the first theoretical evaluation of the guarantees and limits of polynomial-time preprocessing for hard AI problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular we have established super-polynomial kernel lower bounds for many problems, providing firm limitations for the power of polynomial-time preprocessing for these problems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the positive side, we have developed an efficient linear-time kernelization algorithm for the consistency problem for AtMost-NValue constraints, and have shown how it can be used to speed up the complete propagation of NValue and related constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Subsequent to our work, Fellows et al. [29] investigated the parameterized complexity and kernelization for various parameterizations of Abductive Reasoning.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Their kernelization results were mostly negative, showing that many parameterizations for the Abduction problem have no polynomial kernels unless {a mathematical formula}NP⊆coNP/poly.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Similarly negative are the kernelization results of Bäckström et al. [2] for planning problems, parameterized by the length of the plan.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We conclude from these results that in contrast to many optimization problems (see Section 1), typical AI problems do not admit polynomial kernels.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our results suggest the consideration of alternative approaches.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For example, it might still be possible that some of the considered problems admit polynomially sized Turing kernels, i.e., a polynomial-time preprocessing to a Boolean combination of a polynomial number of polynomial kernels.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the area of optimization, parameterized problems are known that do not admit polynomial kernels but admit polynomial Turing kernels [30].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This suggests a theoretical and empirical study of Turing kernels for the AI problems considered.</a>
