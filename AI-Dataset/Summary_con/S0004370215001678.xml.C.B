<a href="#0" id="0">We have proposed a new approach for designing heuristic algorithms based on (1) a framework that can flexibly combine components drawn from existing high-performance solvers, and (2) a powerful algorithm configuration procedure for finding instantiations that perform well on given sets of instances.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach by automatically constructing high-performance stochastic local search solvers for SAT.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have shown that these automatically constructed SAT solvers outperform existing state-of-the-art solvers with manually and automatically optimized configurations on a range of widely studied distributions of SAT instances.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our original inspiration comes from Mary Shelley's classic novel, Frankenstein.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One important methodological difference is that we use automated methods for selecting components for our monster instead of picking them by hand.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The outcomes are quite different.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Unlike the tragic figure of Dr.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Frankenstein, whose monstrous creature haunted him enough to quench forever his ambitions to create a ‘perfect’ human, we feel encouraged to unleash not only our new solvers, but also the full power of our automated solver-building process onto other classes of SAT benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Like Dr.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Frankenstein, we find our creations somewhat monstrous, recognizing that the SATenstein solvers do not always represent the most elegant designs.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, desirable lines of future work include techniques for understanding the importance of different parameters to achieving strong performance on a given benchmark; the extension of our solver framework with preprocessors; and the investigation of algorithm configuration procedures other than ParamILS in the context of our approach.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Encouraged by the results achieved on SLS algorithms for SAT, we believe that the general approach behind SATenstein-LS is equally applicable to non-SLS-based solvers and to other combinatorial problems.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Finally, we encourage members of the SAT community to apply SATenstein-LS to their own instance distributions, and to extend SATenstein-LS with their own heuristics.</a>
