<a href="#0" id="0">We proposed a sound and complete logic system that captures an interplay between the distributed knowledge, coalition strategies, and how-to strategies.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This article is an extended version of our previous conference paper [32], which contained the same results, but did not include the proofs of the soundness and the completeness.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The completeness proof is significantly different from standard proofs of completeness in modal logic because of the peculiarity of know-how modality {a mathematical formula}H. According to item 6 of Definition 7, if {a mathematical formula}w⊮HCφ, then there are two epistemic states {a mathematical formula}w′ and {a mathematical formula}w″ that satisfy curtain conditions (while in the case of S5 and most of other standard modal logics, only one state {a mathematical formula}w′ is required in a similar situation).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, the states {a mathematical formula}w′ and {a mathematical formula}w″ had to be constructed simultaneously because of the inter-dependency between them imposed by Definition 7.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To achieve this, we developed a new technique that we call “harmony”.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This technique is one of the main contributions of this article.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In our upcoming paper [31], this technique is adapted and refined for second-order know-how strategies.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the future work we hope to explore know-how strategies of nonhomogeneous coalitions in which different members contribute differently to the goals of the coalition.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For example, “incognito” members of a coalition might contribute only by sharing information, while “open” members also contribute by voting.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It would also be interesting to investigate the computational complexity of this logic and alternative inference frameworks such as modal and description logics to design tableau algorithms for automated reasoning.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Another direction may be the consideration of different types of coalition knowledge, such as common knowledge.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Finally, one could study the interplay of knowledge and coalition power in a logic where strategies are first class citizen.</a>
