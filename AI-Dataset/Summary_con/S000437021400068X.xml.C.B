<a href="#0" id="0">The notion of regular equivalence has been studied extensively in social network analysis, and it has found many applications in block modeling, network clustering, role or position identification, and so on.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To represent the intensity of ties and interactions between actors, traditional social networks have been generalized to weighted social networks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There exist different, but equivalent, definitions of regular equivalence in the literature.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, when generalized to weighted social networks, the definitions may result in different notions of similarity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Two kinds of generalizations based on the Gödel t-norm, called regular similarity and generalized regular equivalence (GRE), were proposed in [28].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Regular similarity is generalized based on the commutativity between the similarity relation and the underlying fuzzy relation; while GRE is generalized according to the equivalence of the neighborhoods of equivalent nodes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The definition of regular similarity was further generalized to arbitrary residuated lattices in [16].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this paper, we show that many-valued modal logic can characterize regular similarity or GRE in weighted social networks.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By regarding a weighted social network as a model of many-valued modal logic, similar or equivalent actors satisfy the set of modal logic formulas to the same degree.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Specifically, the many-valued modal logic {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) based on the Gödel t-norm characterizes regular similarity in the sense that the degree of similarity between two actors is equal to the fuzzy equivalence of the actors' truth degrees for any formulas of the logic.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In addition, the extensions of {a mathematical formula}G(□◇) with the involutive negation or projection operators characterize GRE in the sense that two actors are equivalent iff they satisfy any formulas of the logics to the same degree.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For a special kind of weighted social network, called a hybrid social network, in which all the actors' attributes are crisp, although their ties may be weighted, we also show its logical characterization by a modal version of possibilistic logic, called QML.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Furthermore, we show that the characterizations of GRE can be extended to many-valued modal logics based on the Łukasiewicz and product t-norms, while the extensions for regular similarity have negative results.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Finally, we demonstrate a potential application of the logical characterizations to privacy-preserving data publication for weighted social networks.</a>
