    The complexity of decision problems about equilibria in two-player Boolean games.
   </title>
   <abstract>
    Boolean games allow us to succinctly represent strategic games with binary payoffs in the case where the players' preferences have a structure readily expressible in propositional logic. Since their introduction, the computational aspects of Boolean games have been of interest to the multiagent community, but so far the focus has been exclusively on pure strategy equilibria. In this paper we consider the complexity of problems involving mixed strategy equilibria, such as the existence of an equilibrium satisfying a given payoff constraint. The results are obtained by the observation that a mixed strategy can hold enough information to encode the computation history of an exponential time Turing machine.

      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      The ideas of game theory find fertile ground in the multiagent framework. Any analysis of a system composed of self-interested agents, whether human or otherwise, cannot ignore the fact that an agent's behaviour is going to be influences by the choices of the agents around him, and in turn his choice of action will necessitate that the other agents respond to him.

     <paragraph>
      Unfortunately games tend to get very large very quickly—the standard normal form representation is of size {a mathematical formula}O(Sn) for a game with n players possessing S strategies each. This has motivated the study of succinct game representations.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The Boolean game [7] is a natural and expressive game representation that achieves succinctness by interpreting a player's strategy as an assignment of truth values and his preferences as a formula of propositional logic. Given n players with formulae of length k, this gives a representation of size {a mathematical formula}O(nk). The dependency on the number of players is reduced to linear, and while no a priori upper bound can be given on k, non-trivial games can be represented with formulae of size logarithmic in the number of strategies.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      There is a wide literature on complexity considerations for Boolean games and related extensions, but, with the exception of a preliminary version of this paper [8], these have said next to nothing about the complexity of mixed equilibria.

      <paragraph>
       Boolean games were first introduced by Harrenstein et al. [7] as two-player, zero-sum games induced by a formula of propositional logic. The multiplayer definition used today is due to [1]. Algorithmic studies (e.g. [2], [1], [3]) focused on the complexity of problems involving pure equilibria, where it was shown that determining whether a pure strategy equilibrium exists is {a mathematical formula}Σ2p-complete, but the complexity can be lower if the players' goal formulae are restricted to a tractable fragment of propositional logic.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Boolean games can be seen to be a special case of circuit games [4], [10]. In a circuit game a player is equipped with a Boolean circuit, control of the input gates is distributed among the players, and the output of the circuit is an integer representing the player's payoff. A Boolean game, then, is a circuit game where the output of the circuit is limited to 0 or 1 and the circuit has fan-out 1. As a consequence of this, a complexity result for circuit games is an upper bound for the complexity of the same problem for Boolean games, and a result for Boolean games is a lower bound for circuit games. In particular, this means the result of [10] that ∃GuaranteeNash is NEXP-complete for circuit games does not imply the result in this paper.

The Boolean representation needs {a mathematical formula}O(∑i=1n|γi|) space. The dependency on the number of players is linear, and {a mathematical formula}|γi| could be as small as {a mathematical formula}log⁡|Si|, seeing how only {a mathematical formula}log⁡|Si| variables are needed to represent {a mathematical formula}2log⁡|Si| strategies.

       Fig. 2.1 shows the algorithmic problems studied in this paper. The problems ∃GuaranteeNash and UniqueNash are well defined for all representations of strategic games and are known to be NP-complete, coNP-complete, and coNP-complete for two-player games in normal form [6]. ∀NashSat and ∃NashSat are defined for Boolean games only.

       Encoding integers in logic
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The goal of this section is to introduce shorthand and notation that will allow us to discuss integers and arithmetic in the language of propositional logic. This will ultimately allow us to interpret a player's strategy as a choice of integers, and a goal formula as an arithmetical constraint.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Our constructions will often involve sequences of propositional variables, so we will use the notation {a mathematical formula}pm‾ to mean {a mathematical formula}p1,…,pm. Sequences differ from sets in that they have an order, which allows us to interpret a truth assignment to a sequence as an integer. We do this in the standard way—a truth assignment that sets {a mathematical formula}pi to true defines a binary integer where the ith most significant bit is 1.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 2.7">
       Let {a mathematical formula}pm‾ be a sequence of m propositional variables, and ν a truth assignment to {a mathematical formula}pm‾. We use {a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛ν to denote the numeric value associated with ν via its assignment to {a mathematical formula}pm‾. That is{sup:1}:{a mathematical formula} If ν is clear from context, we just write {a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛. ■
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       This allows us to define formulae that test truth assignments for arithmetic relations. Let{a mathematical formula}Equal(pm‾;qm‾)denote a term that is true if and only if{a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛=〚qm‾〛. I.e.,{a mathematical formula}ν⊨Equal(pm‾;qm‾)if and only if{a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛ν=〚qm‾〛ν.We can construct{a mathematical formula}Equal(pm‾;qm‾)in time linear in m.Two binary integers are equal if and only if they are bitwise equal. This gives us the following:{a mathematical formula} □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       This is quadratic in the number of variables, giving us the desired result. □Let{a mathematical formula}Less(pm‾;qm‾)denote a term that is true under ν if and only if{a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛ν&lt;〚qm‾〛ν.We can construct{a mathematical formula}Less(pm‾;qm‾)in time cubic in m.Let {a mathematical formula}a[i] be the ith most significant bit of a.Intuitively, if {a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛&lt;〚qm‾〛 for two big-endian binary digits then if we read the bits of the two from left to right we will see a 0 in {a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛 before we see one in {a mathematical formula}〚qm‾〛. That is, there exists a k such that:{a mathematical formula} It follows that the first bit where the two integers differ is a 1 for {a mathematical formula}〚qm‾〛 and a 0 for {a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛. This is clearly both necessary and sufficient.Since there are only m possible values of k, this can be replaced by a cubic size formula that looks as follows:{a mathematical formula} □Let{a mathematical formula}LessEq(pm‾;qm‾)denote a term that is true under ν if and only if{a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛ν≤〚qm‾〛ν.We can construct{a mathematical formula}LessEq(pm‾;qm‾)in time cubic in m.Let{a mathematical formula}AddMod(pm‾;qm‾;rm‾)denote a term that is true if and only if{a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛+〚qm‾〛=〚rm‾〛mod2k. Let{a mathematical formula}Add(pm‾;qm‾;rm‾)denote a term that is true if and only if{a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛+〚qm‾〛=〚rm‾〛.{a mathematical formula}AddMod(pm‾;qm‾;rm‾)and{a mathematical formula}Add(pm‾;qm‾;rm‾)can both be replaced by a formula of propositional logic cubic in m.Binary addition is easy: 0 is identity, and {a mathematical formula}1+1 is 0. In other words if the summands are the same the answer is 0, if they are different the answer is 1. Thus if no carry occurred at position {a mathematical formula}i+1, then {a mathematical formula}ri↔(¬(pi∧qi)). If a carry has occurred, we add another 1 to this result, which gives us {a mathematical formula}ri↔(pi∧qi).We can determine whether a carry bit reached position i with the following formula:{a mathematical formula} In words, {a mathematical formula}Carry(i) holds just if there exists a {a mathematical formula}j&gt;i such that the bits at the jth position are both 1, and every single position between j and i has at least one of the bits being 1.This gives us modular addition:{a mathematical formula} For exact addition, we need to make sure that no carry bit spills over past the 0th position:{a mathematical formula}This is cubic in m, proving the lemma. □

       At times in lieu of testing {a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛 for one of these three relations against {a mathematical formula}〚qm‾〛, we may wish to test, for example, whether {a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛&lt;3. In other words, we would like to have access to constants as well as variables, and that is the purpose of the following definition:

       The reader will note that while the payoff for Player One in any pure profile in a Boolean game need be 1 or 0, there is no such restriction on mixed profiles—after all, the unique mixed equilibrium of Matching Pennies gives either player {a mathematical formula}12. This will provide us with a convenient family of gadget games to facilitate proofs.

       In a win-lose game, {a mathematical formula}v∈[0,1]Q is the probability of Player One winning the game. Given {a mathematical formula}v=ab we can uniformly construct a family of games in which Player One chooses an interval (possibly looping around the edges) of length a over {a mathematical formula}[0,b−1]N, and Player Two chooses a single integer from the same range. If a and b are coprime, i.e. the fraction {a mathematical formula}ab is maximally reduced, we can show that this game has a unique equilibrium—the profile where Player One randomises equally over every interval and Player Two over every integer—the value of which is clearly {a mathematical formula}ab=v. The vocabulary we have developed in Section 2.2 will allow us to express this as a Boolean game.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       For{a mathematical formula}v∈[0,1]Qwe can construct, in time polynomial in{a mathematical formula}|v|, a two-player, zero-sum Boolean game with value v and a unique equilibrium.We shall refer to this game as{a mathematical formula}G(v).The boundary cases where {a mathematical formula}v=0 or {a mathematical formula}v=1 are handled by creating a game with no variables for either player, with Player One's goal formula being ⊥ or ⊤ respectively.For the non-trivial cases, let {a mathematical formula}v=ab. We insist that {a mathematical formula}a,b are coprime.Consider the game where Player One selects two numbers {a mathematical formula}c1,c2∈[0,b−1]N with the property that {a mathematical formula}c2−c1≡a−1modb (the start and end points of an interval of length a). Player Two selects {a mathematical formula}d∈[0,b−1]N. The game is won by Player One if {a mathematical formula}c2≥d≥c1 (Player Two's choice is in a non-looping interval), {a mathematical formula}d≥c1&gt;c2 (Player Two's choice is in a looping interval left of {a mathematical formula}b−1) or {a mathematical formula}c1&gt;c2≥d (Player Two's choice is in a looping interval right of 0).To give this game a Boolean rendition we need the following variables:{a mathematical formula}The interpretation is that {a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛=c1,〚qm‾〛=c2 and {a mathematical formula}〚rm‾〛=d. The s and t variables come in to play if Player One wishes to play a looping interval, in which case {a mathematical formula}〚sm‾〛 is the distance between 0 and {a mathematical formula}c2, while {a mathematical formula}〚tm‾〛 is the distance between {a mathematical formula}c1 and {a mathematical formula}b−1. These variables are added to give us a way to check that if Player One plays a looping interval, its length is still a.Player One's goal formula is the following:{a mathematical formula}The first disjunct handles the case where the interval is non-looping: {a mathematical formula}〚qm‾〛−〚pm‾〛=a−1 (because the interval is closed) and Player Two's choice falls between them. We require that {a mathematical formula}〚sm‾〛=〚tm‾〛=0 to ensure the equilibrium is unique, as otherwise Player One would have been able to assign any value to those variables without affecting his chance of winning. The second disjunct handles the looping case; here {a mathematical formula}〚sm‾〛 and {a mathematical formula}〚tm‾〛 store the length of the interval on either side of zero. The last disjunct of serves to award the game to One should Two name a d outside of {a mathematical formula}[0,b−1]N.As the game is zero-sum, {a mathematical formula}γ2 is simply {a mathematical formula}¬γ1.Now let us verify that the equilibrium is unique. Consider an arbitrary profile σ. We can without loss of generality assume that every strategy in the support of {a mathematical formula}σ2 sets {a mathematical formula}〚rm‾〛≤b−1. Any strategy which does not would yield Player Two a utility of zero in every profile, and as such cannot be part of any equilibrium.Likewise, recall that we are interpreting a pure strategy by Player One as selecting an interval of length a. Not every strategy available to him is amenable to this interpretation. First, Player One could play a strategy where {a mathematical formula}〚qm‾〛−〚pm‾〛=a−1 but not {a mathematical formula}〚sm‾〛=〚tm‾〛=0. Second, he could play a strategy where {a mathematical formula}〚qm‾〛−〚pm‾〛≠a−1 and it is not the case that {a mathematical formula}〚sm‾〛+〚tm‾〛=a−1, {a mathematical formula}〚qm‾〛=〚sm‾〛, and {a mathematical formula}〚pm‾〛+〚tm‾〛=b−1. However, with these strategies, and the assumption that Player Two is only selecting strategies with {a mathematical formula}〚rm‾〛≤b−1, it is impossible to satisfy {a mathematical formula}γ1, meaning they would yield Player One a utility of zero in every profile. We can exclude these strategies as well.As such, every strategy in the support of {a mathematical formula}σ1 is an interval over {a mathematical formula}[0,b−1]N. We say the cover weight of a number i, {a mathematical formula}ci, is the sum of the weights Player One attaches to every interval containing i. That is,{a mathematical formula}In other words, the cover weight of i is the probability that Player Two will lose if she plays i with probability 1. If {a mathematical formula}wj is the weight Player One attaches to the interval starting at j then the cover weight of i, {a mathematical formula}ci, can be expressed as follows:{a mathematical formula} That is, the first {a mathematical formula}wj in the sum is the interval with i at its rightmost point, and hence its leftmost point is at {a mathematical formula}i−(a−1)modb.Now observe that a best response for Player Two to any strategy of Player One is to play {a mathematical formula}arg minici with probability 1, giving Player One a utility of {a mathematical formula}mini⁡ci; Player One's maxmin strategy is thus to maximise the smallest of the cover weights. Furthermore, we can see that the sum of all the cover weights is invariant and equal to a (as the sum of all {a mathematical formula}wi is equal to 1 and each {a mathematical formula}wi appears in a distinct intervals). It follows that the only way to maximise the smallest cover weight is to make all {a mathematical formula}ci equal.We will demonstrate that {a mathematical formula}ci=ci+1 implies that {a mathematical formula}wi−a+1modb=wi+1. As a is a generating element in the additive group of b elements (this is where coprimality comes in), this will establish that all {a mathematical formula}wi must be the same.The argument itself is trivial. Suppose {a mathematical formula}ci=ci+1. If we expand this we have:{a mathematical formula} By subtracting {a mathematical formula}(wi−a+2+…+wi) from both sides we have that {a mathematical formula}wi−a+1=wi+1.We have thus shown that:
       <list>
        In every equilibrium Player One must make all the cover weights equal.The only way to make all the cover weights equal is to play every interval with equal weight.This time we define the
       </list>
       <paragraph>
        breadth of the interval starting at i, {a mathematical formula}bi, to be the sum of the weights, {a mathematical formula}vj, that Player Two attaches to every number in that interval:{a mathematical formula} By an argument parallel to the one above, we see that Player Two seeks to choose a strategy that will make all {a mathematical formula}bi equal. Assuming {a mathematical formula}bi=bi+1, this leads us to:{a mathematical formula} This allows us to invoke the same argument.In sum, we have shown that every equilibrium involves all {a mathematical formula}ci and {a mathematical formula}bi being equal, and the only way to achieve this is by randomising equally over all intervals and integers. This equilibrium is thus unique. □

This notation will be useful in the presence of multiple games, as it will allow us to distinguish between {a mathematical formula}γi(G) and {a mathematical formula}γi(G′).If G is a game or φ is a formula, we will also write {a mathematical formula}var(G) and {a mathematical formula}var(φ) to refer to the set of all variables present in the game or formula respectively. ■

       We formalise this in a definition.A history table is a {a mathematical formula}2k×2k matrix with entries of the form {a mathematical formula}ab; {a mathematical formula}a∈{1,0,˽} and {a mathematical formula}b∈{←,→,qi∈Q}.Row i of T is induced by rule {a mathematical formula}(a,q)→(b,D,q′) of M just if there exists a j such that the {a mathematical formula}(i−1,j)-entry of the history table is {a mathematical formula}aq, for {a mathematical formula}l&lt;j the {a mathematical formula}(i−1,l)-entry contains → in the superscript, for {a mathematical formula}l&gt;j the {a mathematical formula}(i−1,l)-entry contains ← in the superscript, and:If {a mathematical formula}D=Left and {a mathematical formula}j&gt;0, then the {a mathematical formula}(i,j)-entry is {a mathematical formula}b←; letting {a mathematical formula}cd denote the {a mathematical formula}(i−1,j−1)-entry, the {a mathematical formula}(i,j−1)-entry is {a mathematical formula}cq′; for {a mathematical formula}l≠j,j−1, the {a mathematical formula}(i,l)-entry is the same as the {a mathematical formula}(i−1,l)-entry.If {a mathematical formula}D=Left and {a mathematical formula}j=0, then the {a mathematical formula}(i,j)-entry is {a mathematical formula}bq′, and for {a mathematical formula}l&gt;j the {a mathematical formula}(i,l)-entry is the same as the {a mathematical formula}(i−1,l)-entry.If {a mathematical formula}D=Right, then the {a mathematical formula}(i,j)-entry is {a mathematical formula}b→; letting {a mathematical formula}cd denote the {a mathematical formula}(i−1,j+1)-entry, the {a mathematical formula}(i,j+1)-entry is {a mathematical formula}cq′; and for {a mathematical formula}l≠j,j+1, the {a mathematical formula}(i,l)-entry is the same as the {a mathematical formula}(i−1,l)-entry.If {a mathematical formula}D=Stop, then the {a mathematical formula}(i,j)-entry is {a mathematical formula}bq′, and for {a mathematical formula}l≠j the {a mathematical formula}(i,l)-entry is the same as the {a mathematical formula}(i−1,l)-entry.Using {a mathematical formula}wi to denote the ith letter of w, a history table is valid just if:The {a mathematical formula}(0,0)-entry is {a mathematical formula}w0q0.For {a mathematical formula}0&lt;j&lt;|w|, the {a mathematical formula}(0,j)-entry is {a mathematical formula}wj←.For {a mathematical formula}j≥|w|, the {a mathematical formula}(0,j)-entry is {a mathematical formula}˽←.The {a mathematical formula}(K,0) entry is {a mathematical formula}0qa.For {a mathematical formula}i&gt;0, row i of the history table is induced by some rule of the machine. ■Consider the following variables for Player One:{a mathematical formula} With these variables, Player One is able to describe a single entry of T—{a mathematical formula}(〚Timek1‾〛,〚Tapek1‾〛) is the index of the entry, the truth of variables {a mathematical formula}Zero1 and {a mathematical formula}One1 determines whether 0 or 1 appears in that entry, {a mathematical formula}Left1 and {a mathematical formula}Right1 determines whether ← or → appears in the superscript, and {a mathematical formula}State|Q|1‾ the state of the machine. We use {a mathematical formula}ν1(T,i,j) to denote the truth assignment to {a mathematical formula}Φ1′ that sets the truth of the variables in agreement with the {a mathematical formula}(i,j)-entry of T. Not every assignment to {a mathematical formula}Φ1′ is of the form {a mathematical formula}ν1(T,i,j) (e.g. the assignment that sets both {a mathematical formula}One1 and {a mathematical formula}Zero1 to true), but {a mathematical formula}ν1(T,i,j) is well defined for any choice of T and {a mathematical formula}(i,j).Let {a mathematical formula}σ1(T) denote the probability distribution that realises {a mathematical formula}ν1(T,i,j) with probability {a mathematical formula}122k for every choice of {a mathematical formula}(i,j).A key observation, that we will show in Lemma 3.4, is that validity is a local property—if a history table is invalid, there is a {a mathematical formula}2×2 submatrix in the history table testifying to that fact. A local square is a {a mathematical formula}2×2 matrix with entries of the form {a mathematical formula}ab; {a mathematical formula}a∈{1,0,˽} and {a mathematical formula}b∈{←,→,qi∈Q}.Given a history table T, we say that a local square S has {a mathematical formula}(i,j) as its upper left just if S is the submatrix obtained by deleting all rows of T except {a mathematical formula}i,i⊕1 and all columns except {a mathematical formula}j,j⊕1.{sup:2} Note that a consequence of this definition is that {a mathematical formula}(2k,2k) is the upper left of the local square consisting of the {a mathematical formula}(2k,2k),(2k,0),(0,2k),(0,0)-entries of T. ■In our construction, Player Two's strategy will involve naming an index {a mathematical formula}(i,j) and describing the local square with {a mathematical formula}(i,j) as its upper left. To this end, we equip Player Two with the following variables:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}(〚Timek2‾〛,〚Tapek2‾〛) is the upper left of the local square. The truth of variables {a mathematical formula}Zero2 and {a mathematical formula}One2 determines whether 0 or 1 appears in entry {a mathematical formula}(〚Timek2‾〛,〚Tapek2‾〛), {a mathematical formula}Left2 and {a mathematical formula}Right2 whether ← or → appears in the superscript, and {a mathematical formula}State|Q|2‾ the state of the machine. The variables prefixed with s apply likewise to the {a mathematical formula}(〚Timek2‾〛,〚Tapek2‾〛⊕1)-entry, with n the {a mathematical formula}(〚Timek2‾〛⊕1,〚Tapek2‾〛)-entry, and with ns the {a mathematical formula}(〚Timek2‾〛⊕1,〚Tapek2‾〛⊕1)-entry. Given a history table T, we write {a mathematical formula}ν2(T,i,j) to refer to the truth assignment that sets {a mathematical formula}〚Timek2‾〛=i, {a mathematical formula}〚Tapek2‾〛=j, and the other variables to the encoding of the local square with upper left {a mathematical formula}(i,j). {a mathematical formula}σ2(T) is the probability distribution that realises {a mathematical formula}ν2(T,i,j) with probability {a mathematical formula}122k. There exists a formula{a mathematical formula}Valid(Φ2′), of size polynomial in{a mathematical formula}|M|, such that:
       <list>
        A history table T is invalid if and only if there exists an index{a mathematical formula}(i,j)such that{a mathematical formula}ν(T,i,j)⊭Valid.For every ν that does not encode a local square,{a mathematical formula}ν⊭Valid.The game will consist of Player One describing a history table and Player Two verifying that the table is valid. To ensure that the two players are describing the same history table, we introduce the following formula, which is true if Player One names an index within Player Two's local square, and the descriptions of that entry by both players agree:
       </list>
       <paragraph>
        {a mathematical formula} Observe that under {a mathematical formula}(σ1(T),σ2(T)) the formula {a mathematical formula}Agree∧Valid is satisfied with probability 1 if and only if T is valid. However, as of yet the players have no incentive of playing {a mathematical formula}(σ1(T),σ2(T)). We define the following formulae, which are true if Player One names an index outside of the local square named by Player Two:{a mathematical formula} This gives us the complete description of the game:{a mathematical formula} We now claim that the existence of an accepting run of M on w in at most K steps is equivalent to the existence of an equilibrium in the game described where Player Two is guaranteed utility:{a mathematical formula} Suppose an accepting run exists. Let T be a valid history table. Let {a mathematical formula}σi(G(34)) represent Player i's equilibrium strategy in {a mathematical formula}G(34). Consider the profile where Player One plays {a mathematical formula}σ1(T)σ1(G(34)), and Player Two plays {a mathematical formula}σ2(T)σ2(G(34)). Call this profile σ.There is a {a mathematical formula}122k chance of the players playing picking the same index, i.e. the truth assignments {a mathematical formula}(ν1(T,i,j),ν2(T,i,j)). In this case ¬AvoidC, Agree, and Valid are satisfied. This would satisfy {a mathematical formula}γ2.On top of this, there is a {a mathematical formula}322k chance of the players picking one of the following: {a mathematical formula}{(ν1(T,i⊕1,j),ν2(T,i,j)),(ν1(T,i,j⊕1),ν2(T,i,j),(ν1(T,i⊕1,j⊕1),ν2(T,i,j))}. In this case, ¬Avoid, Agree and Valid are satisfied, but {a mathematical formula}γ2(G(34)) has only a {a mathematical formula}14 chance of being satisfied. For any other {a mathematical formula}(ν1(T,i,j),ν2(T,i′,j′)), neither ¬Avoid nor ¬AvoidC is satisfied. Altogether, gives Player Two a {a mathematical formula}122k chance of satisfying {a mathematical formula}γ2 via ¬AvoidC, and {a mathematical formula}3⋅122k⋅4 via ¬Avoid. It remains to see that this is an equilibrium.Suppose Player Two attempts to deviate with a pure strategy. Note that since {a mathematical formula}γ2=(¬AvoidC∨(¬Avoid∧γ2(G(34))))∧γ2′, the probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}¬AvoidC∨(¬Avoid∧γ2(G(34))) is an upper bound on her utility. Given that Player One is playing {a mathematical formula}σ1(T)σ1(G(34), whatever her assignment to {a mathematical formula}Timek2‾,Timek2‾, she will have a {a mathematical formula}122k chance of satisfying ¬AvoidC, and a {a mathematical formula}322k⋅4 chance of satisfying {a mathematical formula}¬Avoid∧γ2(G(34)). Thus she can never obtain a utility superior to {a mathematical formula}v[2].In σ Player One earns {a mathematical formula}1−v[2] utility as he satisfies {a mathematical formula}γ1 precisely when Player Two fails to satisfy {a mathematical formula}¬AvoidC∨(¬Avoid∧γ2(G(34))). Suppose he deviates with a pure strategy Whatever his assignment to {a mathematical formula}Timek1‾,Timek1‾, he will have a {a mathematical formula}122k chance of satisfying AvoidC and a {a mathematical formula}322k chance of Avoid, in which case he has a {a mathematical formula}34 chance of winning {a mathematical formula}G(34). His payoff is thus still {a mathematical formula}1−v[2].Now, suppose that no accepting run exists. We have already observed that Player Two's utility is bounded above by the probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}¬AvoidC∨(¬Avoid∧γ2(G(34))). We will show that there is exactly one way to satisfy this with probability at least {a mathematical formula}v[2], which will allow us to reduce the number of equilibria we need to consider—any equilibrium that does not offer a {a mathematical formula}v[2] chance of satisfying {a mathematical formula}¬AvoidC∨(¬Avoid∧γ2(G(34))) would yield Player Two less than {a mathematical formula}v[2] utility.Let {a mathematical formula}xi,j be the probability with which Player Two plays {a mathematical formula}(〚Time2k‾〛=i and {a mathematical formula}〚Tape2k‾〛=j. Note that Player One's payoff for playing {a mathematical formula}(〚Time1k‾〛=i,〚Tape1k‾〛=j) with probability 1 is {a mathematical formula}1−ci,j, defining {a mathematical formula}ci,j to be:{a mathematical formula} As such, a necessary condition for equilibrium is that Player Two chooses a strategy where all {a mathematical formula}ci,j are equal, else Player One could play {a mathematical formula}arg mini,jci,j with probability 1. To maximise her utility, Player Two must maximise the value of {a mathematical formula}ci,j. As can be seen from the sum below, this involves setting {a mathematical formula}ci,j=v[2]:{a mathematical formula} Thus we only need to consider equilibria where the probabilities {a mathematical formula}xi,j form a solution to the linear system {a mathematical formula}ci,j=v[2].Let A be a {a mathematical formula}22k×22k matrix of coefficients with row {a mathematical formula}i+2kj corresponding to the equation {a mathematical formula}ci,j and column {a mathematical formula}i+2kj to the variable {a mathematical formula}xi,j. Observe that every row in this matrix contains a 1 on the diagonal and 3 {a mathematical formula}14's elsewhere in the row. Define a disc for each row with centre {a mathematical formula}A[i,i] and radius {a mathematical formula}∑j≠i|A[i,j]|. By Gerschgorin's circle theorem [5], every eigenvalue of the matrix lies in at least one such disc. Since none of the discs cover 0, the matrix is non-singular, and the system {a mathematical formula}ci,j=v[2] has a unique solution—namely, the solution that involves Player Two playing {a mathematical formula}xi,j=122k. We can thus restrict ourselves to equilibria of this form, as no other equilibria can give Player Two a utility of at least {a mathematical formula}v[2].If Player One is playing all {a mathematical formula}(i,j) with non-zero probability, then by Lemma 3.4 there must exist some {a mathematical formula}(i,j) that does not satisfy Valid, and hence Player Two cannot attain {a mathematical formula}v[2] utility. Suppose Player One attaches zero weight to some entries, but all the other entries satisfy Valid. Let {a mathematical formula}(i,j) be an entry to which Player One attaches zero weight, and {a mathematical formula}(i′,j′) the entry to which Player One attaches the highest weight. As Player Two is randomising equally, she must attach the same weight to the local square with upper left {a mathematical formula}(i,j), as to the local square with upper left corner {a mathematical formula}(i′,j′). This profile cannot be in equilibrium: if x is the probability Player One attaches to {a mathematical formula}(i′,j′) then by transferring the weight Player Two currently attaches to the local square with upper left {a mathematical formula}(i,j) to the local square with upper left {a mathematical formula}(i′,j′) she will lose at most {a mathematical formula}x⋅322k⋅4 utility, and gain at least {a mathematical formula}x⋅122k utility—which would be a profitable deviation. □

       Having established that ∃GuaranteeNash is NEXP-complete, we can return to more familiar game-theoretic arguments for the other problems. The difficulty lies in expressing the constructions in the restricted vocabulary of Boolean games, which requires a bit of coding.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proof">
       UniqueNashand ∀NashSatare coNEXP-complete for two-player Boolean games. ∃NashSatis NEXP-complete.For ∃NashSat, we reduce from ∃GuaranteeNash, while for UniqueNash and ∀NashSat we reduce from the complement of ∃GuaranteeNash. The idea is, given an instance {a mathematical formula}(G,v) of ∃GuaranteeNash, we construct a game where the players can either play in G or can unilaterally deviate to a game where they get a utility of {a mathematical formula}v[1](1−v[2]) or {a mathematical formula}v[2](1−v[1]) in a unique equilibrium. The player who does not deviate gets nothing, so there is no equilibrium where one player chooses G and the other to switch. Hence if ∃GuaranteeNash does not have an equilibrium guaranteeing the players at least v utility, there will be a unique equilibrium where both players deviate. To extend the proof to ∀NashSat, we will show that there exists a formula φ that is true in the unique equilibrium with probability one, and if the equilibrium is not unique then there exists an equilibrium in which φ is false with non-zero probability. Likewise, for ∃NashSat, we show there exists a ψ that is false in the unique equilibrium, but if the equilibrium is not unique then there is some equilibrium under which ψ is true with a probability of one.Let G be a Boolean game and {a mathematical formula}v∈[0,1]Q2. Let {a mathematical formula}u=v[1] and {a mathematical formula}w=1−v[2]. Construct {a mathematical formula}G(u) and {a mathematical formula}G(w) over fresh variables. Recall, from Lemma 2.16, that {a mathematical formula}G(u) and {a mathematical formula}G(w) each have a unique equilibrium. Introduce new Play and Dummy variables for both players.We claim that {a mathematical formula}G′ with the following parameters has a unique Nash equilibrium if and only if {a mathematical formula}(G,v)∉ ∃GuaranteeNash:{a mathematical formula}The formulae φ and ψ are the following:{a mathematical formula}First, suppose that {an inline-figure}, and σ is an equilibrium that satisfies the payoff criterion. Consider any profile {a mathematical formula}σ′ in {a mathematical formula}G′ in which:
       <list>
        {a mathematical formula}σ′|G=σ.{a mathematical formula}P(Play1=true)=0, {a mathematical formula}P(Play2=true)=0.{a mathematical formula}σ′|G(u) and {a mathematical formula}σ′|G(w) are the unique equilibria of {a mathematical formula}G(u) and {a mathematical formula}G(w) respectively.Observe that the utility of Player One under
       </list>
       <paragraph>
        {a mathematical formula}σ′ is {a mathematical formula}wv[1]—a probability of {a mathematical formula}v[1] of satisfying {a mathematical formula}γ1(G) and a probability of w of satisfying {a mathematical formula}γ1(G(w)). Likewise, the utility of Player Two is {a mathematical formula}(1−u)v[2]. We will show that no deviation can improve a player's utility.In order for Player One to satisfy {a mathematical formula}γ1, he must satisfy {a mathematical formula}γ1(G(w)) and one of {a mathematical formula}(¬Play1∧¬Play2∧γ1(G)) or {a mathematical formula}(Play1∧¬Dummy1∧(⋀p∈var1(G)¬p)∧γ1(G(u))). These two disjuncts are mutually exclusive, so we only need to consider Player One's probability of satisfying one or the other. Given that {a mathematical formula}σ2′|G(w) is the equilibrium strategy, Player One's probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}γ1(G(w)) is always w. The probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}(¬Play1∧¬Play2∧γ1(G)) is at most {a mathematical formula}v[1], else Player One would have a profitable deviation from σ in G, which we assumed to be an equilibrium. The probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}(Play1∧¬Dummy1∧(⋀p∈var1(G)¬p)∧γ1(G(u))) is the probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}γ1(G(u)) which, given {a mathematical formula}σ2′|G(u) being the equilibrium strategy, is u. As {a mathematical formula}u=v[1], Player One's utility in either case is bounded above by {a mathematical formula}wv[1]. Mutatis mutandis, for Player Two.This establishes that every {a mathematical formula}σ′ is an equilibrium. This means that the equilibrium is not unique, so {an inline-figure}, and since {a mathematical formula}P(Play1=true)=0 and {a mathematical formula}P(Play2=true)=0, φ is always false under {a mathematical formula}σ′ and hence {an inline-figure}. Conversely, since ψ is true with probability one under {a mathematical formula}σ′, {an inline-figure}. Now suppose that {an inline-figure}. We claim that the only equilibrium of {a mathematical formula}G′ involves setting the variables in G as well as {a mathematical formula}Dummy1,Dummy2 to false, {a mathematical formula}Play1,Play2 to true and playing the unique equilibria of {a mathematical formula}G(u) and {a mathematical formula}G(w) over the remaining variables.First note that this is indeed an equilibrium—Player One's probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}γ1(G(w)) is always w, his probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}γ1(G(u)) is always u, and given that Player Two's strategy realises {a mathematical formula}Play2=true with probability one, Player One's probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}(¬Play1∧¬Play2∧γ1(G)) is zero.Now consider any other profile {a mathematical formula}σ′. Note that if the profile realises {a mathematical formula}¬Play1∧¬Play2 with non-zero probability, then {a mathematical formula}σ′|G must be an equilibrium of G, else one of the players could increase their probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}(¬Play1∧¬Play2∧γ1(G)) or {a mathematical formula}(¬Play1∧¬Play2∧γ2(G)) respectively. However this leads directly to a contradiction. Since {an inline-figure}, at least one of the players will satisfy {a mathematical formula}γi(G) under {a mathematical formula}σ′|G with probability strictly less than {a mathematical formula}v[i]. Without loss of generality, let it be Player One. In this case Player One has a deviation available to him: by setting {a mathematical formula}Play1 to true, {a mathematical formula}Dummy1 and all variables in G to false he can transfer the weight he is currently assigning to {a mathematical formula}(¬Play1∧¬Play2∧γ1(G)), which yields him less than {a mathematical formula}v[1] utility, to {a mathematical formula}(Play1∧¬Dummy1∧(⋀p∈var1(G)¬p)∧γ1(G(u))), where he can guarantee himself at least {a mathematical formula}u=v[1] by playing the equilibrium play of {a mathematical formula}G(u). This does not affect the probability of him satisfying {a mathematical formula}γ1(G(w)) and hence increases the probability of satisfying {a mathematical formula}γ1.Next suppose that {a mathematical formula}¬Play1∧¬Play2 is realised with probability 0. We can safely assume that the players set {a mathematical formula}Play1,Play2 to true with probability 1 and {a mathematical formula}var1(G),var2(G),Dummy1,Dummy2 with probability 0, as anything else would lose them the game. The remaining variables are {a mathematical formula}var1(G(u)),var2(G(u)) and {a mathematical formula}var1(G(w)),var2(G(w)), and there is a unique way to play those in equilibrium. But that would means {a mathematical formula}σ′ is precisely the profile we started with initially, and hence the equilibrium must be unique. Since the equilibrium involves {a mathematical formula}Play1 and {a mathematical formula}Play2 being realised with probability one, φ is satisfied in the unique, and hence in every, equilibrium of G. On the contrary, ψ is false in the unique equilibrium, and hence there exists an equilibrium under which ψ is not true with a probability of one. □
