    Evidential reasoning rule for evidence combination.
   </title>
   <abstract>
    This paper aims to establish a unique Evidential Reasoning (ER) rule to combine multiple pieces of independent evidence conjunctively with weights and reliabilities. The novel concept of Weighted Belief Distribution (WBD) is proposed and extended to WBD with Reliability (WBDR) to characterise evidence in complement of Belief Distribution (BD) introduced in Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory of evidence. The implementation of the orthogonal sum operation on WBDs and WBDRs leads to the establishment of the new ER rule. The most important property of the new ER rule is that it constitutes a generic conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process, or a generalised Bayesian inference process. It is shown that the original ER algorithm is a special case of the ER rule when the reliability of evidence is equal to its weight and the weights of all pieces of evidence are normalised. It is proven that Dempsterʼs rule is also a special case of the ER rule when each piece of evidence is fully reliable. The ER rule completes and enhances Dempsterʼs rule by identifying how to combine pieces of fully reliable evidence that are highly or completely conflicting through a new reliability perturbation analysis. The main properties of the ER rule are explored to facilitate its applications. Several existing rules are discussed and compared with the ER rule. Numerical and simulation studies are conducted to show the features of the ER rule.

      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Providing an ER framework for evidence combination and information fusion in an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system has been an important task and attracted significant interests and efforts from communities in AI, computing, operational research, decision sciences, system sciences, control theory, information systems, etc. From all databases in the Web of Knowledge, the term ER first appeared in a paper published by AI in 1985 [15], although the term might well have been used in other context earlier. In their paper, Gordon and Shortliffe embraced the use of a D–S scheme for evidence-aggregation processes in a hypothesis space. In another paper published also in AI[24], it was shown that ER could be conducted in the same hypothesis space using a Bayesian scheme. However, the two schemes are different, and the nature and significance of their differences were investigated [20].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The D–S scheme is based on a frame of discernment composed of a set of propositions that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive [25]. In the D–S scheme, basic probabilities can be assigned to not only singleton propositions but also any of their subsets, thereby allowing a piece of evidence to be profiled by a BD defined on the power set of the frame of discernment. BD is regarded as the most natural and flexible generalisation of conventional probability distribution in the sense that the former allows inexact reasoning at whatever level of abstraction [15] and on the other hand reduces to the latter if basic probabilities are assigned to singleton propositions only. It is in this context that D–S theory is claimed to generalise Bayesian inference [25]. Indeed such generalisation differentiates between ignorance (or lack of knowledge, as defined in Section 2.1) and equal likelihood, and does not assume evidence partially in favour of a proposition to be construed as evidence against the same proposition through the commitment of the remaining belief to its negation [15], [20]. These attractive features have motivated the use of D–S theory in many areas like knowledge-based system [22], [8], pattern recognition [6], information fusion [21], [30], [14], Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and risk analysis [38], [40], [2], [41], [37], [33], [42].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The kernel of D–S theory is Dempsterʼs rule [4], [5], [25], which is rooted in probability theory and constitutes a conjunctive probabilistic inference process. Indeed it generalises Bayesʼ rule and was promoted as the sole Evidence Combination Rule (ECR) to combine evidence in the D–S framework originally [25]. As it stands however, Dempsterʼs rule has no definition and cannot be applied in a special case when two pieces of evidence are in complete conflict, i.e. with each supporting different propositions. This lack of definition has led to a counter-intuitive problem when the rule is used to combine evidence in high (or near complete) conflict [46], [23], [16], [32]. Another concern about Dempsterʼs rule is that it assumes that each piece of evidence is fully reliable and can veto any proposition, as discussed in Section 2.2 in detail. This means that if a piece of evidence does not support a proposition at all, that proposition will be ruled out completely. In other words, Dempsterʼs rule accumulates consensus support only and rejects a proposition completely if it is opposed by any evidence, no matter what support it may get from any other evidence. While this may be acceptable in special cases, general situations are that multiple pieces of evidence are of a compensatory nature and each play limited roles or have various degrees of reliabilities in support for and opposition against propositions [41], [28].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Since the counter-intuitive problem of Dempsterʼs rule was identified over three decades ago, a plethora of alternative ECRs have been developed and reviewed in the literature [16], [17], [14], each with its own merits as well as drawbacks. In this paper, it is not intended to provide another full review of these existing rules. Instead, typical ECRs will be briefly compared to emphasise the motivation of this research. Existing alternative ECRs are aimed to replace Dempsterʼs rule for addressing the counter-intuitive problem and can be differentiated on the basis of how they deal with conflict among evidence [14]. Three typical views can be found in the literature: (1) allocating conflicting beliefs to the frame of discernment as global ignorance [36], (2) allocating conflicting beliefs to a subset of relevant focal propositions as local ignorance [9] or redistributing it among focal propositions locally [27], and (3) modifying initial belief function to better represent original information without modifying Dempsterʼs rule [16].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      One common observation of the alternative ECRs is that they are non-probabilistic in the sense that they change the specificity of evidence in basic probability assignment and/or do not constitute a Bayesian inference process when used to combine probability information. It is therefore difficult to interpret the results generated by using the alternative ECRs. A critical question then arises as to whether it is meaningful to replace Dempsterʼs rule in situations where it is applicable, or whether it is sufficient to identify rules to combine pieces of highly or completely conflicting evidence. A more general question is how to combine pieces of evidence with various weights and reliabilities that have different meanings. The importance of a piece of evidence reflects a decision makerʼs preferences over the evidence, which is subjective, depending on who makes the judgement when using the evidence. On the other hand, reliability is used to measure the quality of a piece of evidence objectively, which is the inherent property of the information source where the evidence is generated, and is independent of who may use the evidence [28].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      This paper is aimed to address the above questions and establish a unique rule, referred to as Evidential Reasoning rule, or ER rule for short, to combine multiple pieces of independent evidence for generating their joint support for a proposition. A piece of evidence is said to be independent if the information it carries does not depend on whether other evidence is known or not. This research is also motivated to investigate the rationale and foundation of the ER approach, which was developed to support MCDA of a quantitative and qualitative nature under uncertainty by applying D–S theory [38], [40], [41], [43], to generalise it for evidence combination in general.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In the ER approach [41], a basic probability mass is generated by multiplying the degree of belief by the weight of evidence. The Basic Probability Assignment (bpa) scheme of the ER approach ensures that the residual support left uncommitted due to the weight of evidence is made assignable to any singleton propositions and the frame of discernment, depending upon what propositions other evidence supports. In D–S theory, the residual support is assigned to a specific proposition: the frame of discernment [25]. This specific assignment does not differentiate between ignorance and the residual support, whilst the former is an intrinsic property of the evidence and the latter reflects its extrinsic feature related to its relative importance compared with other evidence. This indiscrimination changes the specificity of evidence, leading to a dilemma that even if all pieces of evidence point precisely and unambiguously to a proposition their combined support for the proposition generated using the Dempsterʼs rule will still be imprecise or incomplete.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In this paper, the new ER rule with evidence weight considered (or ER rule with weight in short) is first established by generalising the above bpa scheme of the ER approach. The first step of the ER rule is to construct a new WBD as the counterpart of BD for a piece of evidence to cater for its extrinsic feature of relative importance. The second step is to implement the orthogonal sum operation to combine the WBDs of multiple pieces of independent evidence. WBD is then extended to take into account both weight and reliability by constructing a new WBD with Reliability (WBDR). The new ER rule with both weight and reliability considered results from implementing the orthogonal sum operation on WBDRs. No specificity of any evidence is changed in the process of constructing WBD or WBDR. The ER rule thus constitutes a generic conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process to combine pieces of independent evidence with various weights and reliabilities.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Since it is based on the orthogonal sum operation, the ER rule is inherently associative and commutative, meaning that it can be used to combine multiple pieces of evidence in any order without changing the final results. In this paper, it is proven that the ER rule satisfies four synthesis axioms that ought to be followed by a rational probabilistic reasoning process [41], [17]. It is shown that the ER algorithm [41] is a special case of the ER rule when the reliability of evidence is equal to its weight that is normalised to be relative to each other among all evidence in question. It is proven that Dempsterʼs rule is also a special case of the ER rule when each piece of evidence is fully reliable. In particular, the ER rule completes and enhances Dempsterʼs rule by identifying, through a novel reliability perturbation analysis proposed in this paper, how to combine multiple pieces of independent evidence that are each fully reliable but highly or completely conflicting with each other. The ER rule is compared with other ECRs that can be used to combine pieces of evidence with different weights and reliabilities, in particular the PCR5 rule [28]. Comprehensive numerical studies are conducted to validate and illustrate the potential applications of the ER rule in comparison with other ECRs.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, the concepts of D–S theory and Dempsterʼs rule are briefly introduced, and several other typical ECRs are discussed. In Section 3, following an investigation into evidence weight and a brief introduction to both the PCR5 rule and the ER approach, the rationale and process to construct WBD are investigated, leading to the establishment of the new ER rule with weight. A numerical study is conducted to compare the ER rule with other ECRs. Section 4 is dedicated to the establishment of the new ER rule with both weight and reliability considered, and a comprehensive numerical study is conducted to validate and compare the ER rule with other ECRs. The properties of the ER rule are explored in Section 5, where it is proven that both the ER approach and Dempsterʼs rule are special cases of the ER rule. The reliability perturbation analysis of the ER rule is reported, resulting in the completion and enhancement of Dempsterʼs rule for combination of evidence in high or complete conflict. The simulation study is conducted in this section to show how the ER rule can be used for conflict resolution with Zadehʼs example revisited and analysed in detail. The paper is concluded in Section 6.

     Brief introduction to D–S theory and typical ECRs
     <paragraph>
      The establishment of the new ER rule is based on {a mathematical formula}D–S theory, in particular the concept of BD and the orthogonal sum operation. It is thus necessary to provide a brief introduction to the prior knowledge as a basis for later discussions.
     </paragraph>
     <section label="2.1">
      Basic concepts of D–S theory
      <paragraph>
       D–S theory was originally investigated in the 1960ʼs [4], [5], formalised in the 1970ʼs [25] and has been researched ever since [3], [36], [26], [29], [38], [23], [41], [16], [33], [34], [14], [8]. In this subsection, the basic concepts of D–S theory are briefly discussed.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Suppose {a mathematical formula}Θ={θ1,…,θN} is a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive propositions, with {a mathematical formula}θi∩θj=∅ for any {a mathematical formula}i,j∈{1,…,N} and {a mathematical formula}i≠j where ∅ is an empty set. Θ is then referred to as a frame of discernment. A Basic Probability Assignment (bpa) is a function {a mathematical formula}m:2Θ→[0,1], satisfying [25]{a mathematical formula} with {a mathematical formula}2Θ or {a mathematical formula}P(Θ) representing the power set of Θ, consisting of the {a mathematical formula}2N subsets of Θ, or{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       {a mathematical formula}m(θ) is a basic probability mass that is assigned exactly to a proposition θ and to no smaller subset. Basic probability masses assigned to all the subsets of Θ are summed to unity and there is no belief left to the empty set. In this paper, a basic probability mass assigned exactly to Θ is referred to as the degree of global ignorance, denoted by {a mathematical formula}m(Θ); a basic probability mass assigned exactly to a smaller subset of Θ except for any singleton proposition or Θ is referred to as the degree of local ignorance. If there is no local or global ignorance, a bpa function will reduce to a classical probability function.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Associated with each bpa are a belief measure, denoted by {a mathematical formula}Bel(θ), and a plausibility measure, denoted by {a mathematical formula}Pl(θ), which are defined by the following equations [25]:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}Bel(θ) represents all basic probability masses assigned exactly to θ and its smaller subsets, and {a mathematical formula}Pl(θ) represents all possible basic probability masses that could be assigned to θ and its smaller subsets. As such, {a mathematical formula}Bel(θ) and {a mathematical formula}Pl(θ) can be interpreted as the lower and upper bounds of probability to which θ is supported [36], [10], [31]. The two measures are connected by the following equation [25]{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}θ¯ denotes the complement or negation of θ. The difference between the belief and plausibility measures of θ describes the degree of ignorance for θ.

       Dempsterʼs rule
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The kernel of D–S theory is Dempsterʼs rule that was originally adopted as the sole ECR to combine independent evidence that is fully reliable. By fully reliable evidence, it is meant that a proposition will not be supported at all if it is ruled out by the evidence. The rule adopts the orthogonal sum operation to combine evidence, which is rooted in calculating the joint probability of independent events [19]. With two pieces of independent and fully reliable evidence represented by two bpas {a mathematical formula}m1 and {a mathematical formula}m2 respectively, for any proposition {a mathematical formula}θ⊆Θ, Dempsterʼs rule is given as follows [25]{a mathematical formula} where ⊕ is the orthogonal sum operator.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Dempsterʼs rule forms a conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process, takes Bayesʼ rule as a special case, and is both associative and commutative [25], [19], which are among the most important and useful properties for both human and machine reasoning. It is clear from the multiplication operation in the above equation that Dempsterʼs rule provides a process for combining two pieces of non-compensatory evidence, in the sense that if either of them completely opposes a proposition, the proposition will not be supported at all, no matter how strongly it may be supported by the other piece of evidence. For example, if {a mathematical formula}m1(B)=0 for any {a mathematical formula}B∩θ=θ, meaning that θ is not supported by {a mathematical formula}m1 at all, the numerator of formula (5) will be zero. In other words, in Dempsterʼs rule, a proposition will be supported only if both pieces of evidence each support it to some degrees. Note that Dempsterʼs rule is not defined where two pieces of evidence are in complete conflict, or {a mathematical formula}∑B∩C=∅m1(B)m2(C)=1, as in this case the denominator of formula (5) is zero, as is the numerator. It is shown that Dempsterʼs rule may lead to a counter-intuitive result when used to combine highly conflicting evidence [45], [46], [23], [32]. As mentioned in the literature, because the two pieces of evidence in Zadehʼs example [45], [46] are both Bayesian and Bayesʼs Rule is a special case of Dempsterʼs rule [25], such a counter-intuitive problem is also associated with classical probabilistic reasoning [16]. It is therefore fundamental to deal with the non-definition and counter-intuitive problem in the context of probabilistic reasoning.
      </paragraph>
     </section>
     <section label="2.3">
      Other typical ECRs for comparison
      <paragraph>
       To overcome the non-definition and counter-intuitive problem associated with Dempsterʼs rule, a plethora of different ECRs have been developed on the basis of various views. Three different views were outlined in the introduction section. The rest of this section is dedicated to discussing these different views in some detail.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Yagerʼs rule [36] can be described by the following equations:{a mathematical formula} Different from Dempsterʼs rule, Yagerʼs rule is proposed to allocate conflicting beliefs ({a mathematical formula}∑B∩C=∅m1(B)m2(C) of Eq. (6)) to the frame of discernment, thus avoiding the non-definition and counter-intuitive problem of Dempsterʼs rule. However, this solution comes with high prices. On one hand, it treats two pieces of completely conflicting evidence in the same way as if there was no evidence at all. On the other hand, because of its way to allocate conflicting beliefs, it does not constitute a conjunctive reasoning process or the orthogonal sum operation as Dempsterʼs rule does, so it is not a probabilistic reasoning process. In other words, the use of Yagerʼs rule to combine two pieces of evidence in conflict but with no ignorance, as represented by a standard probability distribution, will result in a combined distribution that is not a probability distribution in the sense that it will have global ignorance. A question then arises as to whether such treatment of conflict is rational or not, as it introduces ignorance which “invents” uncertainty unnecessarily and could be misleading.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Dubois and Pradeʼs rule [9] can be described as follows{a mathematical formula} Dubois and Pradeʼs rule can also avoid the non-definition and counter-intuitive problem associated with Dempsterʼs rule. Compared with Yagerʼs rule, it allocates conflicting beliefs locally in the sense that conflict should be resolved among focal propositions in which the conflict occurs. This is perhaps a more rational view than treating any conflict as global ignorance as in Yagerʼs rule. However, Dubois and Pradeʼs rule does not constitute a conjunctive or probabilistic reasoning process either, in the sense that there is no probabilistic rule to legitimise the conjunctive belief {a mathematical formula}m1(B)m2(C) for θ from the union {a mathematical formula}B∪C=θ with {a mathematical formula}B∩C=∅. If Dubois and Pradeʼs rule is used only to replace Dempsterʼs rule for combining highly or completely conflicting evidence, there are issues about how to combine evidence with or without high conflict consistently and how to distribute beliefs among focal propositions for conflict resolution, which will be investigated in next sections.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The PCR5 rule [27] evolved from Dubois and Pradeʼs rule and can be described as follows{a mathematical formula} If the denominator is zero, the fraction will not be taken into account. From Eq. (8), it is clear that apart from inheriting the merits of Dubois and Pradeʼs rule the PCR5 rule also proposes a way to redistribute conflicting beliefs locally. Nonetheless, unlike Dempsterʼs rule, the PCR5 rule is not a conjunctive or probabilistic reasoning process, nor is it Bayesian reasoning process when used to combine evidence with no ignorance. Indeed it is termed as a plausible and paradoxical reasoning process by its authors [13], [27]. If the PCR5 rule is used for conflict resolution only, there is an issue of how to interpret and justify the way of proportionally redistributing conflicting beliefs among the focal propositions concerned. This issue will be investigated in next sections.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The third view [16] is not to create alternative rules for replacing Dempsterʼs rule in situations where it is applicable. Rather, it is only necessary to fix the problem of Dempsterʼs rule when used to combine highly or completely conflicting evidence. However, the two approaches proposed by Haenni [16] are either to assume that highly conflicting evidence could be interpreted and represented in different ways or that experts are not fully reliable. While these approaches are aimed to reduce conflict at the modelling stage, they lead to changing the specificity of evidence but still do not resolve the problem of how to consistently combine pieces of fully reliable evidence that are genuinely in high or complete conflict, or how to ensure that such a combination process still constitutes a probabilistic reasoning process and keeps intact the most important property of Dempsterʼs rule that it generalises Bayesʼ rule. These different views will be further investigated in next sections.

     New ER rule to combine evidence with weight
     <paragraph>
      To deal with the non-definition and counter-intuitive problem of Dempsterʼs rule and answer the questions discussed above, it is helpful to review the origin of D–S theory as described in Shaferʼs book [25]. As explained at the start of the first chapter of the book, D–S theory “is a theory of evidence because it deals with weights of evidence and with numerical degree of support based on evidence”. Here the importance of and the difference between the concepts of evidence weight and evidence support cannot be made clearer. As such, it is fundamental to start with investigating the key issue of how to deal with evidence weight in an evidence combination process. A few relevant ECRs are then examined in this section.
     </paragraph>
     <section label="3.1">
      <section-title>
       Evidence weight
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       What is the weight of evidence and how to quantify it? In Shaferʼs book, this question was first analysed in an intuitive and straightforward manner, though followed by a chapter (Chapter 5) dedicated to this topic in a rather abstract or theoretical way. Nevertheless, it is the intuitive explanation of evidence weight as described in Section 1 on Simple Support Function in Chapter 4 of Shaferʼs book [25] that provides an important hint to answer this question. In that section, it is stated that in a situation “where the evidence points precisely and unambiguously to a single non-empty subset A of Θ”, “we can say that the effect of the evidence is limited to providing a certain degree of support for A”, denoted by {a mathematical formula}S(A) with {a mathematical formula}0⩽S(A)⩽1. For such a statement, Shafer used a term “simple support function” to name {a mathematical formula}S(A) by saying at the end of this section that “indeed, if {a mathematical formula}S(A) is a simple support function focused on A, then S is the belief function with the basic probability numbers {a mathematical formula}m(A)=S(A), {a mathematical formula}m(Θ)=1−S(A) and {a mathematical formula}m(B)=0 for all other {a mathematical formula}B⊂Θ”.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Based on the above arguments, one cannot help but comprehend that {a mathematical formula}S(A) has already taken into account the weight of evidence, just as mentioned at the beginning of Chapter 5 in Shaferʼs book where it is said that weights of evidence were translated into simple support functions as discussed in Chapter 4. Following these arguments, let w stand for the weight of a piece of evidence and {a mathematical formula}p(θ) for the degree of belief to which the evidence points to a single non-empty subset θ of Θ, or the probability to which the proposition θ can be proven when the evidence is gathered, we can have the following relationship among support function {a mathematical formula}S(θ), weight w and the degree of belief {a mathematical formula}p(θ){a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       What Eq. (9) means is that the degree of support for a proposition is proportional to both the weight of the evidence and the belief degree to which the evidence points to the proposition. In Shaferʼs simple support function, {a mathematical formula}p(θ) is assumed to be one. From Eq. (9), we then get {a mathematical formula}m(θ)=w. As investigated in the next two sections, the above ideas about evidence weight have been embedded in some existing methods. The difference is how to handle the residual support left by the evidence due to its weight, as measured by {a mathematical formula}1−w. In Shaferʼs book, the residual support is allocated to Θ, or {a mathematical formula}m(Θ)=1−S(θ)=1−w, as discussed above. In literature, this idea is generalised and formalised as Shaferʼs discounting method, defined for convenience of discussion as follows.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 1">
       Shaferʼs discountingSuppose {a mathematical formula}p(θ) is the degree of belief to which a piece of evidence points to a proposition θ. Let α be a factor that is used to discount {a mathematical formula}p(θ), where α ({a mathematical formula}0⩽α⩽1) can be interpreted as the reliability or importance of the evidence, depending upon circumstances in which α is used. Then, Shaferʼs discounting method is defined to generate bpa for the evidence as follows{a mathematical formula}Shaferʼs discounting method changes the specificity of the original evidence in the sense that as long as {a mathematical formula}1−α&gt;0, global ignorance is introduced to a belief distribution even when the evidence points to a proposition θ precisely and unambiguously, or {a mathematical formula}p(θ)=1. In other words, if {a mathematical formula}α&lt;1 there will always be {a mathematical formula}m(Θ)⩾1−α&gt;0 even if {a mathematical formula}p(θ)=1. In what follows, two other schemata for allocating the residual support {a mathematical formula}1−α are examined and the rationale of using Eq. (9) to assign basic probability mass or the degree of support for a proposition is discussed in the context of information fusion and multiple criteria decision analysis, both of which share some common features and requirements.

      Introduction to the {a mathematical formula}PCR5 rule with evidence weight
      <paragraph>
       PCR5 was extended to deal with evidence weight in the context of importance discounting [28]. In this approach, the weight of a source is characterised by an importance factor, or w with {a mathematical formula}0⩽w⩽1. In the extended PCR5, the degree of support for a proposition is given in the same way as in Eq. (9), but the residual support is assigned to the empty set as shown in the follow definition.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 2">
       PCR5 importance discountingSuppose w is the weight of a piece of evidence. The PCR5 importance discounting method is defined to generate bpa for the evidence as follows{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It is important to note that in Eq. (11)bpa is assigned to the empty set. This means that the distribution generated using Eq. (11) is not a probability distribution even when there is no ignorance in the original evidence, nor is it a belief distribution as defined in D–S theory because similar to probability theory no belief can be assigned to the empty set in D–S theory. Indeed, a new theory coined as DSmT[27] is proposed to deal with such bpas. In DSmT, the PCR5 rule is modified to handle bpas as generated by Eq. (11), referred to as {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ which is the same as Eq. (8) except that {a mathematical formula}m(∅) is not set to zero and the empty set is treated in the same way as any other subsets of Θ in the process of evidence combination. This is the only difference between {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ and PCR5. While this paper is not intended to investigate DSmT in detail, it is worth noting that {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ does not constitute a probabilistic reasoning process for evidence combination as discussed in D–S theory or in classical Bayesian probability theory. As such, there is a question as to how to interpret the results generated by applying {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅. Another concern is that because the {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ rule does not have the property of commutativity, the final results generated by the {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ rule depend on the order in which evidence is combined. In DSmT, much attention is paid to simultaneous combination of evidence.

      Introduction to the ER approach and its weight handling method
      <paragraph>
       In the ER approach [38], [39], [40], [41], [44], the assessment of an alternative on each criterion is regarded as a piece of evidence; the weight of evidence is equal to the weight of a criterion. Suppose there are a number of alternatives and each is assessed on L criteria {a mathematical formula}ei ({a mathematical formula}i=1,…,L) using a common set of N assessment grades (propositions) {a mathematical formula}θn ({a mathematical formula}n=1,…,N), constituting a frame of discernment denoted by {a mathematical formula}Θ={θn,n=1,…,N}. If an alternative is assessed to a grade {a mathematical formula}θn on a criterion {a mathematical formula}ei with a belief degree {a mathematical formula}pn,i, this assessment can be profiled as a BD defined by:{a mathematical formula} with {a mathematical formula}0⩽pn,i⩽1 ({a mathematical formula}n=1,…,N), {a mathematical formula}∑n=1Npn,i⩽1 and {a mathematical formula}pΘ,i=1−∑n=1Npn,i being the degree of global ignorance.

First, the basic probability masses for {a mathematical formula}e1 are generated as weighted belief degrees as follows{a mathematical formula} Note that {a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),1 is the remaining support left uncommitted by {a mathematical formula}e1, coined as the residual support of {a mathematical formula}e1 that cannot be assigned by {a mathematical formula}e1 alone due to its weight. It is assignable to any individual and/or subsets of grades, depending upon the nature and weights of other pieces of evidence. Similarly, basic probability masses for another assessment {a mathematical formula}e2 are generated by{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The basic probability masses of {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 are combined into the joint probability masses for {a mathematical formula}θn, Θ and {a mathematical formula}P(Θ) using the following equations:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If there are more than two assessments to be combined, Eqs. (16a) to (16d) can be repeated to combine the 3rd assessment with the previously-combined assessment {a mathematical formula}mn,e(2) ({a mathematical formula}n=1,…,N), {a mathematical formula}mΘ,e(2) and {a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),e(2), and so on until all assessments are combined recursively. The combined belief degrees, denoted by {a mathematical formula}pn,e(2) and {a mathematical formula}pΘ,e(2) for {a mathematical formula}L=2 without loss of generality, are generated by reassigning {a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),e(2) back to all focal elements of Θ as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The combined assessment is then profiled by the following combined BD:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The combined BD provides a panoramic view about the overall performance of an alternative with the degrees of its strengths and weaknesses (represented by the assessment grades {a mathematical formula}θn) explicitly measured by the belief degrees. We now show that the above-outlined original ER algorithm can be rewritten in the same way as given by the following lemma.

      <paragraph>
       In Eq. (19c), there are two square bracket terms. We name the first term as the bounded sum of individual support from each of the two pieces of evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 for the proposition that an alternative is assessed to {a mathematical formula}θn. In other words, it is the sum of the degree of individual support {a mathematical formula}mn,1 from {a mathematical formula}e1 bounded by ({a mathematical formula}1−w2) and the degree of the individual support {a mathematical formula}mn,2 from {a mathematical formula}e2 bounded by ({a mathematical formula}1−w1). Note that {a mathematical formula}w1 is the weight of {a mathematical formula}e1 and ({a mathematical formula}1−w1) sets a bound on the role that {a mathematical formula}e2 can play in its individual support for a proposition. The first term implies that the higher the importance of a piece of evidence, the less room it leaves for the other evidence to play. We name the second square bracket term as the orthogonal sum of collective support from both {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2, with {a mathematical formula}mn,1mn,2 measuring the degree of direct or homogeneous support and ({a mathematical formula}mn,1mΘ,2+mΘ,1mn,2) measuring the degree of intersected or heterogeneous support for the proposition that an alternative is assessed to {a mathematical formula}θn due to the fact that {a mathematical formula}θn∩Θ=θn for any {a mathematical formula}n=1,…,N and {a mathematical formula}θ∩P(Θ)=θ for any {a mathematical formula}θ⊆Θ.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The above discussions show that the combined degree of belief {a mathematical formula}pn,e(2) given by Eq. (19a) is equal to the bounded sum of individual support plus the orthogonal sum of collective support from {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 for a proposition that an alternative is assessed to {a mathematical formula}θn. This is an interesting result that we will discuss in more detail in next sections.

      New weighted belief distribution (WBD)
      <paragraph>
       In Eq. (12), only global ignorance was taken into account. In general, a piece of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei can be profiled by a BD, defined as follows{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}(θ,pθ,i) is an element of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei, representing that the evidence points to proposition θ to the degree of {a mathematical formula}pθ,i. {a mathematical formula}(θ,pθ,i) will be referred to as a focal element of {a mathematical formula}ei if {a mathematical formula}pθ,i&gt;0. In Eq. (20), both global ignorance and local ignorance are taken into account. Suppose the weight of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei is denoted by {a mathematical formula}wi for {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,L, which are not necessarily normalised to unity as required in Eq. (13).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We are now in a position to generalise the bpa calculation method proposed in the ER approach, as shown by Eq. (14), for assigning basic probability masses generally. First of all, it is worth noting that the method shown in Eq. (14) recognises the difference between residual support and the degree of global ignorance. In other words, the residual support of {a mathematical formula}ei is measured by {a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),i=1−wi, which is not assigned to Θ as global ignorance and hence is not part of {a mathematical formula}mΘ,i in {a mathematical formula}ei in both bpa calculation and the process of combining evidence. The importance of this distinction cannot be overemphasised because the global ignorance in a piece of evidence is its intrinsic property and has no relevance to other evidence, whilst the residual support is the extrinsic feature of the evidence and is incurred due to the relative importance of the evidence compared with other evidence. Without making this distinction, global ignorance would be introduced into a piece of evidence even if the evidence originally has no ignorance at all, which would inevitably lead to the change of the specificity or the distortion of the evidence. Combining distorted evidence leads to irrational results in the sense that even if all pieces of evidence are given as precise probability distributions with no ignorance at all their combined results will still have a degree of global ignorance.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If such distinction is ignored, for example, as in the case of using Shaferʼs discounting method to take into account weights of evidence, we would have to face the question of how to interpret the results generated. To illustrate the above arguments, suppose the following two pieces of evidence are given equal weight {a mathematical formula}w1=w2=1−γ with {a mathematical formula}0⩽γ⩽1{a mathematical formula} where A, B and C are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive propositions, and δ is a small positive real number with {a mathematical formula}0⩽δ⩽1.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If δ is set to be a small number, for example {a mathematical formula}δ=0.01, and Shaferʼs method is used to discount the two pieces of evidence by their weights {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2, we would have the following discounted BDs{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where the element {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C} is the frame of discernment representing global ignorance.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If γ is taken as a small number, for example {a mathematical formula}γ=0.05, applying Dempsterʼs rule to aggregate the above two discounted BDs (22) and (23) will lead to the following result:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       This result makes sense but is not precise, because the aggregated result of the two pieces of evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 with no ignorance at all still includes a belief degree of 0.0256 allocated to the frame of discernment showing a degree of global ignorance, even though the degree 0.0256 is rather small.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It is easy to show that for any {a mathematical formula}γ&gt;0 the result generated by combining (22) and (23) using Dempsterʼs rule will always lead to similar imprecise results in the sense that the combined degree of belief in {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C} will always be positive. An extreme case in the above example is to set {a mathematical formula}δ=1 and {a mathematical formula}γ&gt;0. In this case, B is surely supported by each of the two pieces of evidence with no ignorance or ambiguity; however, their combination leads to a positive degree of belief in {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C} for any {a mathematical formula}γ&gt;0, which is obviously irrational. This will still be the case even if there are many more pieces of evidence surely supporting B.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The above discussions show that it is irrational to assign the residual support specifically to the frame of discernment. Following similar arguments, it can be asserted that it is irrational to assign the residual support specifically to only one of other propositions. If Eq. (1) is followed, as is the case in D–S theory, the residual support must not be assigned to the empty set either. So, it seems that the only appropriate way to allocate the residual support is to make it assignable to any propositions with no prior specification, which implies that the residual support should be assigned to the power set of the frame of discernment instead of specifically to the frame of discernment or any its single subset. The above discussion leads to the following definition.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 3">
       Weighted belief degreeSuppose {a mathematical formula}wi{a mathematical formula}(0⩽wi⩽1) is the weight of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei defined in Eq. (20) with {a mathematical formula}wi=0 and 1 standing for “not important at all” and “the most important” respectively. The weighted belief degree for {a mathematical formula}ei are then defined as follows{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The term {a mathematical formula}mθ,i may also be referred to as basic probability mass or the degree of support for θ from {a mathematical formula}ei. Definition 3 generalises the bpa method of the ER approach as shown in Eq. (14) to handle both local and global ignorance. It is worth noting that multiplying {a mathematical formula}pθ,i by the same weight {a mathematical formula}wi for all {a mathematical formula}θ⊆Θ does not change the relativity property of belief degree, or {a mathematical formula}mA,i/mB,i=pA,i/pB,i for any {a mathematical formula}A,B⊆Θ. As such, the specificity of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei is kept intact. In Definition 3 the residual support ({a mathematical formula}1−wi) of {a mathematical formula}ei is nominally attached to {a mathematical formula}P(Θ) without being pre-assigned to any specific proposition of Θ. The residual support can thus be conjunctively redistributed to all propositions because {a mathematical formula}θ∩P(Θ)=θ for any {a mathematical formula}θ⊆Θ. This can ensure genuine conjunctive reasoning in an evidence combination process.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To facilitate conjunctive reasoning based on Definition 3, evidence profiled by Eq. (20) needs to be represented by a so-called Weighted Belief Distribution (WBD) defined as follows. First, note from the above discussions that the residual support ({a mathematical formula}1−wi) of {a mathematical formula}ei is the amount of remaining support left uncommitted by {a mathematical formula}ei due to its weight. This means that {a mathematical formula}ei plays only a limited role equal to its weight {a mathematical formula}wi in support for a proposition and the quantity ({a mathematical formula}1−wi) sets a bound on the role that another piece of evidence can play with which {a mathematical formula}ei is combined. The WBD of {a mathematical formula}ei, denoted by {a mathematical formula}mi, is then constructed from its BD by replacing each belief degree {a mathematical formula}pθ,i with its weighted belief degree {a mathematical formula}mθ,i, and by adding to BD a special element {a mathematical formula}(P(Θ),mP(Θ),i) as follows{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Note that {a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),i=1−wi is the residual support of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei incurred due to its weight and there is {a mathematical formula}∑θ⊆Θmθ,i+mP(Θ),i=wi∑θ⊆Θpθ,i+(1−wi)=1 since {a mathematical formula}∑θ⊆Θpθ,i=1 in Eq. (20). It is interesting to note from Definition 3 that the following one-to-one connection always holds between a BD and its corresponding WBD:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The above analysis shows that a BD (Eq. (20)) and its WBD (Eq. (26)) are complementary to each other for representing the same piece of evidence and can be deduced from each other through Eqs. (25) and (27). In other words, BD and WBD are the two sides of the same coin for representing the same piece of evidence. While the BD of a piece of evidence is used to describe its intrinsic property of how it points to propositions, its corresponding WBD is used to represent its extrinsic support for propositions in comparison with other evidence, as discussed in detail later in this paper. A special case of Eq. (26) is when there is no local ignorance. In this case, WBD reduces to the following format:{a mathematical formula} Note that in Eq. (28) there is {a mathematical formula}∑n=1Nwipθn,i+wipΘ,i+(1−wi)=1 as {a mathematical formula}∑n=1Npθn,i+pΘ,i=1. The original ER algorithm is generated by implementing the orthogonal sum operation on WBDs, as given by the following theorem.

      New ER rule with evidence weight
      <paragraph>
       In Theorem 1, we assumed that there exists no local ignorance in all evidence. In the following discussions, we drop this assumption by taking into account both global and any local ignorance. We thus generalise the ER algorithm to the following ER rule.

      <paragraph label="Theorem 2">

Note that the conjunction of a proposition θ with the power set {a mathematical formula}P(Θ) is still itself θ. As such, for example, the residual support ({a mathematical formula}1−w1) of evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 is conjunctively redistributed to all the focal elements of {a mathematical formula}e2. This ensures that the specificity of a belief distribution is kept intact in the evidence combination process in the sense that only the focal elements of {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 will remain as focal elements after combination. Consequently, in the combination process no belief is distributed to the empty set that is not a focal element in any legitimate belief distribution.
      </paragraph>

       Theorem 2 reinforces the notion that the combined degree of belief to which two pieces of independent evidence jointly support a proposition consists of two parts: the bounded sum of their individual support (the square bracket term in Eq. (30)) and the orthogonal sum of their collective support (the last term of Eq. (30)). The rationale of Eq. (30) can be explained as follows. If two pieces of evidence each play limited roles bounded by their weights, in addition to their collective support, individual support from any evidence should be counted as part of the combined support in general. If one piece of evidence plays a dominant role, individual support from the other evidence will be counted only to reinforce what are already supported by the dominant evidence but not for any other propositions. To combine more than two pieces of independent evidence, we have the following results.

       First numerical comparison study
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In this section, a simple example [28] is re-examined to illustrate how the following three rules deal with evidence weights differently: Dempsterʼs rule (Eq. (5)) with Shaferʼs discounting method of Eq. (10), the {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ rule (Eq. (8) except that {a mathematical formula}m(∅) is not forced to 0) with the {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ importance discounting method given by Eq. (11), and the ER rule with weight. The example is re-described using the notation of belief (probability) distribution defined by Eq. (20) as follows.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 1">
       Suppose {a mathematical formula}Θ={A,B} and there are two pieces of independent evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 given by {a mathematical formula}e1={(A,0.8),(B,0.2)} and {a mathematical formula}e2={(A,0.4),(B,0.6)}, both of which are complete without any ignorance, that is they are both Bayesian probability distributions.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Case 1">
       No importance discountingSuppose the two pieces of evidence are both very important and have the same maximal importance, or {a mathematical formula}w1=w2=1. The process and results generated using the three rules are shown in Tables 1. Note that in this case Eq. (29) reduces to Eq. (5), so the ER rule reduces to Dempsterʼs rule. The results generated by {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ are different from those of Dempsterʼs rule or the ER rule. This is not surprising as {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ is not a Bayesian process and adopts a relative weighting scheme to allocate the conflicting beliefs between A and B, so A and B are given different proportions of the conflicting beliefs. In Dempsterʼ rule however, the conflicting beliefs earmarked to the empty set initially are re-distributed to the propositions A and B by the same proportion of (1–0.56).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Case 2">
       With importance discountingNow suppose the weights of {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 are different and are given for example by {a mathematical formula}w1=0.2 and {a mathematical formula}w2=0.8. Note that there is {a mathematical formula}w1+w2=1 in this case as the relative importance of {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 is taken into account. In general, this unity constraint does not have to be applied. The process and results generated using the three rules are shown in Tables 2. It is worth noting that as there is no ignorance in {a mathematical formula}e1 or {a mathematical formula}e2, the final result for {a mathematical formula}m(Θ), the degree of global ignorance generated by Dempsterʼs rule, as shown in the Θ column and the fifth row of Table 2, is incurred entirely due to using Shaferʼs discounting method (Eq. (10)), or assigning {a mathematical formula}m(P(Θ)) to Θ so {a mathematical formula}m(Θ)=m(P(Θ)). If {a mathematical formula}m(P(Θ)) is then redistributed to A and B, or {a mathematical formula}p(A)=m(A)/(1−m(Θ))=0.3726/(1−0.1757)=0.452 and {a mathematical formula}p(B)=m(B)/(1−m(Θ))=0.4517/(1−0.1757)=0.548, these results will be the same as those generated by the ER rule, as shown in the last row of Table 2. If there is global ignorance in any evidence however, the separation between {a mathematical formula}m(Θ) and {a mathematical formula}m(P(Θ)) and the redistribution of {a mathematical formula}m(P(Θ)) become impossible after the combination of evidence by Dempsterʼs rule. Without the separation and redistribution, the final results shown in the fifth row of Table 2 are counter-intuitive as both pieces of evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 or {a mathematical formula}e2 are complete and Bayesian but their combined result becomes incomplete and non-Bayesian. This example shows that Shaferʼs discounting method leads to a non-Bayesian reasoning process. This also explains why the residual support {a mathematical formula}(1−wi) needs to be earmarked for or nominally allocated to {a mathematical formula}P(Θ) rather than specifically assigned to any individual element of {a mathematical formula}P(Θ)a priori.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In Table 2, the results generated by the {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ rule are close to those generated by the ER rule. However, this seems more coincidental for this particular example than general. This is because when applying {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ to get the bpa of a piece of evidence its specificity is changed, as beliefs are assigned to the empty set in {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅. However, when applying the ER rule to get the bpa there is no change of specificity for any evidence. Also, the two rules forms different processes with {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅ being a non-Bayesian process and the ER rule a conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process, or a generalised Bayesian reasoning process.

     New ER rule to combine evidence with both weight and reliability
     <paragraph>
      Shaferʼs discounting [25] has been widely regarded as reliability discounting [14]. As discussed in the introduction section, there is clear difference between evidence importance and evidence reliability. In information fusion, for example, the importance of an information source is indicated by weight as granted to the source by a fusion system designer, which can be relative to other information sources; the reliability of an information source represents its ability to provide correct assessment or solution for a given problem [28]. In other words, the reliability and importance of a piece of evidence may not measure the same property of the evidence, and as such they need to be treated separately in an inference process. In this section, we first review how this was handled in the enhanced PCR5 rule, which seems to be the closest to what is established in this paper. We will then enhance the ER rule to deal with both evidence importance and reliability in a unified and coherent framework of weighted belief distributions with reliability, followed by a comparison study.
     </paragraph>
     <section label="4.1">
      Introduction to the {a mathematical formula}PCR5 rule to combine evidence with weight and reliability
      <paragraph>
       In the enhanced PCR5 rule, weight and reliability are taken into account by using Shaferʼs discounting method to deal with reliability and the PCR5 importance discounting method (Definition 2) to handle weight [28]. The basic idea is to generate bpa by first discounting the ith piece of evidence with its reliability using Shaferʼs discounting method (Eq. (10)), followed by discounting the discounted evidence with its weight using the PCR5 importance discounting method (Eq. (11)), with the generated bpa represented by {a mathematical formula}mri,wi. An alternative way is to change the order of the two types of discounting, with the generated bpa represented by {a mathematical formula}mwi,ri. In general, it is the case that {a mathematical formula}mri,wi≠mwi,ri, and therefore different methods could be developed to combine these two types of bpa. Since these methods are fairly similar, we only introduce the first method.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       This method consists of the following steps:Step 1: Apply Shaferʼs discounting method to discount evidence by reliability and then the PCR5 importance discounting method to further discount the discounted evidence by weight, leading to {a mathematical formula}mri,wi(θ) for all θ and {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,L. Then combine {a mathematical formula}mri,wi(θ) for all {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,L for each θ using {a mathematical formula}PCR5∅, and normalise the combined bpa, which is represented by {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5∅,r,w(θ).Step 2: Reverse the order of the first part in Step 1 to get {a mathematical formula}mwi,ri(θ) for all θ and {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,L. Then repeat the next two parts of Step 1 to get {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5∅,w,r(θ).Step 3: Combine the bpas generated from Step 1 and Step 2 using some combination rule such as the arithmetic mean operator, to get the final result, given by {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5(θ).The above PCR5 method is straightforward and relatively simple if any possible complexity of the PCR5 rule is taken out of the picture. Since the two discounting methods each change the specificity of evidence as mentioned above, the process of this method is no longer Bayesian after the implementation of Shaferʼs discounting method for reliability, nor is it a probable reasoning process as defined in D–S theory after the implementation of the PCR5 importance discounting method for weight. This reasoning process may be interpreted as a plausible and paradoxical reasoning process as for the PCR5 rule. So it remains as a question how to interpret the results generated by using the PCR5 Method 1.

       In Section 3.3, the weight of a piece of evidence was used to define WBD for representing the degree of support to each proposition, with the residual support, measured by {a mathematical formula}1−wi, earmarked to the power set. This approach retains the specificity of the original evidence as represented by a belief distribution in the processes of both generating bpa and combining support by the orthogonal sum operation. As such, it is a conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process or a Bayesian process when used to combine probability distributions.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The role of the residual support can be explained by examining the ER rule. As shown in Eq. (30), the real purpose of the residual support {a mathematical formula}1−w1 (or {a mathematical formula}1−w2) is to set a bound within which the other piece of evidence can play a limited role. For example, if {a mathematical formula}1−w1=0, there will be {a mathematical formula}(1−w1)mθ,2=0. This means that if {a mathematical formula}1−w1=0 the individual support for θ from the second piece of evidence {a mathematical formula}e2 will not be counted at all, however reliable {a mathematical formula}e2 may be. At the other extreme, if {a mathematical formula}1−w1=1, the individual support from {a mathematical formula}e2 will be fully counted. The same can be said for the first piece of evidence if {a mathematical formula}1−w2=0 or {a mathematical formula}1−w2=1. This shows that the residual support {a mathematical formula}1−wi acts as the unreliability of the ith piece of evidence. The above analysis leads to the following more generic definition.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Definition 4">
       ER weighting with reliabilitySuppose {a mathematical formula}wi is the weight of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei defined in Eq. (20) with {a mathematical formula}0⩽wi⩽1 and {a mathematical formula}ri is the reliability of {a mathematical formula}ei with {a mathematical formula}0⩽ri⩽1 and {a mathematical formula}ri=0 and 1 standing for “not reliable at all” and “fully reliable” respectively. The basic probability masses for {a mathematical formula}ei are then assigned as follows{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In Definition 4, {a mathematical formula}m˜θ,i measures the degree of support for θ from {a mathematical formula}ei with both the weight and reliability of {a mathematical formula}ei taken into account. {a mathematical formula}1−ri is the unreliability of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei, which sets a bound on the role that other evidence can play when combined with {a mathematical formula}ei. In particular, there is {a mathematical formula}m˜P(Θ),i=0 when {a mathematical formula}ri=1, so any θ will be ruled out by {a mathematical formula}ei if {a mathematical formula}m˜B,i=0 for any {a mathematical formula}B∩θ=θ, whatever support θ may get from other evidence. {a mathematical formula}crw,i is a normalisation factor such that {a mathematical formula}∑θ⊆Θm˜θ,i+m˜P(Θ),i=1 given {a mathematical formula}mθ,i=wipθ,i and {a mathematical formula}∑θ⊆Θpθ,i=1.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Let {a mathematical formula}w˜i=crw,iwi. In Eqs. (35), {a mathematical formula}crw,imθ,i is then equal to {a mathematical formula}w˜ipθ,i and {a mathematical formula}crw,i(1−ri) equal to {a mathematical formula}1−w˜i. As such, Eq. (35) can be equivalently rewritten as follows{a mathematical formula} which is consistent with Definition 3 with {a mathematical formula}w˜i acting as a new weight. Hence, {a mathematical formula}crw,i also acts as a regulative coefficient to adjust {a mathematical formula}wi according to reliability {a mathematical formula}ri, resulting in a hybrid weight {a mathematical formula}w˜i with {a mathematical formula}w˜i&lt;wi ({a mathematical formula}crw,i&lt;1) if {a mathematical formula}ri&lt;wi, {a mathematical formula}w˜i=wi ({a mathematical formula}crw,i=1) if {a mathematical formula}ri=wi, and {a mathematical formula}w˜i&gt;wi ({a mathematical formula}crw,i&gt;1) if {a mathematical formula}ri&gt;wi. Furthermore, if {a mathematical formula}ei is fully reliable, or {a mathematical formula}ri=1, there will be {a mathematical formula}w˜i=1; if {a mathematical formula}ei is not fully reliable, or {a mathematical formula}ri&lt;1, there will be {a mathematical formula}w˜i&lt;1. Since {a mathematical formula}crw,i⩾0 and {a mathematical formula}wi⩾0, there is always {a mathematical formula}w˜i⩾0. {a mathematical formula}w˜i can thus be interpreted as a hybrid weight and reliability coefficient for {a mathematical formula}ei, or the adjusted weight of {a mathematical formula}ei, to measure the degree of support from {a mathematical formula}ei with {a mathematical formula}1⩾w˜i⩾0. From Definition 4, a piece of evidence can be represented by{a mathematical formula} The above distribution is called Weighted Belief Distribution with Reliability (WBDR).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It is worth noting that in Definition 4 the original specificity of the belief distribution of {a mathematical formula}ei as represented by {a mathematical formula}pθ,i is strictly preserved because the following equation always holds{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Given the above discussions, the new ER rule with weight and reliability taken into account results from the orthogonal sum of two WBDRs as follows.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Corollary 3">
       ER rule with weight and reliabilitySuppose two pieces of independent evidence{a mathematical formula}e1and{a mathematical formula}e2are each profiled by Eq.(20)and their WBDRs are represented by Eq.(38). The combined degrees of belief to which{a mathematical formula}e1and{a mathematical formula}e2jointly support proposition θ, denoted by{a mathematical formula}pθ,e(2), is given by Eq.(29)with{a mathematical formula}mˆθ,e(2)given by{a mathematical formula}

      <paragraph label="Proof">

The proof is then the same as for proving Theorem 2 by implementing the orthogonal sum operation on the WBDRs of {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 with {a mathematical formula}crw,i cancelled out in the normalisation.  □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To combine multiple pieces of evidence, we have the following results.

       Recursive ER rule with weight and reliabilitySuppose L pieces of independent evidence are each profiled by Eq.(20)and their WBDRs are represented by Eq.(38). Suppose{a mathematical formula}e(i)is defined in the same way as inCorollary 1. The combined degree of belief to which L pieces of independent evidence{a mathematical formula}eiwith weight{a mathematical formula}wiand reliability{a mathematical formula}ri{a mathematical formula}(i=1,…,L)jointly support proposition θ is given by Eq.(34)with{a mathematical formula}mˆθ,e(L)generated by recursively applying Eq.(31)and the following two equations{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}

      <paragraph label="Proof">

The proof is then the same as for proving Corollary 1, Corollary 2 by implementing the orthogonal sum operation recursively on the WBDRs of {a mathematical formula}ei for {a mathematical formula}i=1,…,L, followed by implementing Eq. (34) once at the end with {a mathematical formula}crw,i cancelled out in the normalisation.  □
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It should be noted that in both Corollary 3, Corollary 4 the orthogonal sum operation was used to combine WBDRs. As such, the above ER rule with evidence weight and reliability constitutes a conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process and is a Bayesian inference process when used to combine probability information.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We can now calculate overall reliability. Let {a mathematical formula}re(L) stand for the combined reliability of all L pieces of evidence {a mathematical formula}e(L) and {a mathematical formula}we(L) for the combined weight of {a mathematical formula}e(L). From Eqs. (36) and (37), we get {a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),e(L)=(1−re(L))/(1+we(L)−re(L)). With {a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),e(L) generated by Corollary 4 and {a mathematical formula}we(L) judged by the decision maker, we can get {a mathematical formula}re(L) as follows{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       It should be noted that the above equation does not define the relationship between reliability and weight. Rather, it is simply deduced to calculate the combined reliability from the generated residual support {a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),e(L), which depends on how {a mathematical formula}we(L) is judged. If {a mathematical formula}we(L)=re(L), there will be {a mathematical formula}re(L)=1−mP(Θ),e(L). If a precise judgement for {a mathematical formula}we(L) cannot be provided, the range of possible values for {a mathematical formula}we(L) can be decided by noting that the maximal value for {a mathematical formula}we(L) is 1 and the minimal value of {a mathematical formula}we(L) should not be smaller than the maximum of the weights of the L pieces of evidence combined. So, in general {a mathematical formula}re(L) is given by{a mathematical formula} It is worth noting from Corollary 4 that {a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),e(L) will be zero if and only if any piece of evidence is fully reliable. From Eq. (43), it can then be said that {a mathematical formula}re(L) will be one if and only if any of the L pieces of evidence is fully reliable, and otherwise less than one.

       Second numerical comparison study
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       From the literature, only the PCR5 Method as summarised in Section 4.1 is found comparable with the new ER rule in terms of distinctively taking into account both the weight and the reliability of evidence in combination. In this section, these two rules are compared using the same example as examined in the literature [28].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Suppose {a mathematical formula}Θ={A,B,C} with A, B and C mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, and three pieces of independent evidence {a mathematical formula}e1, {a mathematical formula}e2 and {a mathematical formula}e3 are represented by three belief distributions as shown by the 2nd to 4th rows of Table 3. Suppose their reliabilities are given by {a mathematical formula}r1=0.8, {a mathematical formula}r2=0.5 and {a mathematical formula}r3=0.2 respectively, and their weights by {a mathematical formula}w1=0.9, {a mathematical formula}w2=0.3 and {a mathematical formula}w3=0.6 respectively.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The results generated by using the PCR5 Method 1 were originally provided in Tables 5 to Table 7 of the paper authored by Smarandache et al. [28]. These results are rearranged in a consistent way with the other results of this paper, as shown in Table 4. In rows 2–4 of Table 4 headed by {a mathematical formula}mr1,w1(θ), {a mathematical formula}mr2,w2(θ) and {a mathematical formula}mr3,w3(θ), the reliability-importance discounting is performed for {a mathematical formula}e1, {a mathematical formula}e2 and {a mathematical formula}e3 by applying Shaferʼs reliability discounting method first (Eq. (10) with α replaced by {a mathematical formula}ri), followed by applying the PCR5 importance discounting method (Eq. (11)). Similarly, the importance-reliability discounting (Eq. (11) applied first and then Eq. (10) with α replaced by {a mathematical formula}ri) is performed as shown in rows 5–7 of Table 4 headed by {a mathematical formula}mw1,r1(θ), {a mathematical formula}mw2,r2(θ) and {a mathematical formula}mw3,r3(θ). The results of Steps 1, 2 and 3 of the PCR5 Method 1 are given by rows 8, 9 and 10 of Table 4 headed by {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5∅,r,w(θ), {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5∅,w,r(θ) and {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5(θ) respectively.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The results generated by using the ER rule are shown in Table 5. The support for each proposition from every piece of evidence is given as bpa generated by using Definition 4, as shown in rows 2–4 of Table 5 headed by {a mathematical formula}m˜θ,1, {a mathematical formula}m˜θ,2 and {a mathematical formula}m˜θ,3 respectively. {a mathematical formula}mˆθ,e(2) and {a mathematical formula}mθ,e(2), followed by {a mathematical formula}mˆθ,e(3) and {a mathematical formula}mθ,e(3), in rows 5–8 of Table 5 are generated by applying Corollary 3 recursively, and {a mathematical formula}pθ,e(3) in row 9 of Table 5 by using Corollary 4.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The final results of the PCR5 method shown in the last row of Table 4 are significantly different from those of the ER rule shown in the last row of Table 5. A question arises as to which results could be trusted and if so why? Comparing the three pieces of evidence given in rows 2–4 of Table 3 with those of rows 2–4 of Table 4 generated by the reliability-importance discounting, it can be noted that the specificity of the original evidence is changed. For example, {a mathematical formula}e1 does not contain any global ignorance with {a mathematical formula}p{A,B,C},1=0 as shown in the 2nd row and last column of Table 3, but after the discounting there is {a mathematical formula}mr1,w1({A,B,C})=0.18 as shown in the 2nd row and last column of Table 4. There are similar specificity changes for {a mathematical formula}e2 and {a mathematical formula}e3. For {a mathematical formula}e3, the specificity change leads to difficulty in interpreting bpa and consequently the final results. This is because {a mathematical formula}e3 does include global ignorance with {a mathematical formula}p{A,B,C},3=0.1, as shown in the last row and last column of Table 3 which is then mixed with the residual support of {a mathematical formula}e3, or {a mathematical formula}1−w3, in the discounting and/or combination processes. The outcome {a mathematical formula}mr3,w3({A,B,C})=0.492 in the 4th row and last column of Table 4 is a mix of two different things: global ignorance and residual support. The discounting also leads to basic probability masses being given to the empty set for {a mathematical formula}e1, {a mathematical formula}e2 and {a mathematical formula}e3 with {a mathematical formula}mr1,w1(∅)=0.1, {a mathematical formula}mr2,w2(∅)=0.7 and {a mathematical formula}mr3,w3(∅)=0.4 as shown in rows 2–4 and column 2 of Table 4. One of the consequences of these changes of specificity is that the three distributions shown in rows 2–4 of Table 4 are no longer a belief distribution as defined in D–S theory and that the numbers in the distributions need to be reinterpreted because they are not probability as defined in probability theory or belief as defined in D–S theory. There are similar changes of specificity after the importance-reliability discounting method is employed, as shown in rows 5–7 of Table 4.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       As discussed before, the PCR5 rule is not a probabilistic reasoning process, so the result it generates is not a probability, nothing to say that the specificity of each piece of evidence has already been changed even before the PCR5 rule is applied. As such, there is a question as to how to interpret what the results generated by PCR5 actually mean. By looking at the final result shown in the last row of Table 4, one obvious concern is that a large portion of the final result is generated as global ignorance with {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5({A,B,C})=0.3506, as shown in the last row and last column of Table 4. Hence it may be concluded from this final result that:
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item label="•">
        it is most plausible that proposition A is true with a plausibility degree of at least 53.34%, which could be as high as 95.38%, or {a mathematical formula}(0.5334+0.0388+0.031+0.3506)×100, and
       </list-item>
       <list-item label="•">
        any other proposition could also be true with a range of plausibility degrees that could be as high as over 35.06%.
       </list-item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       The question is whether such conclusions make sense or not. To answer this question, it is necessary to look at the original data and use intuitive reasoning qualitatively. It is obvious from Table 3 that proposition A should be the most likely to occur among all propositions. So the above first conclusion does make sense. However, is the range of plausibility degrees {a mathematical formula}[53.34%,95.38%] appropriate? To answer this question, letʼs examine the original and generated data for {a mathematical formula}{A,C}, {a mathematical formula}{B,C} and {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C}. In the original data, each of them is only given a belief degree of 0.1 in {a mathematical formula}e1, {a mathematical formula}e2 and {a mathematical formula}e3 respectively, or {a mathematical formula}p{A,C},1=0.1, {a mathematical formula}p{B,C},2=0.1 and {a mathematical formula}p{A,B,C},3=0.1 as shown in Table 3. It thus seems reasonable to expect that none of them should be given a larger degree of belief than 0.1 in the final results after the three pieces of evidence are combined. In the final result shown in the last row of Table 4, there are {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5({A,C})=0.031 and {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5({B,C})=0.0032, which look reasonable. However, we have {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5({A,B,C})=0.3506, which is much larger than 0.1, inconsistent with the expectation.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       A question then arises as to whether it is appropriate to conclude that one would still be 35.06% totally ignorant about which proposition or subset of propositions is true after combining the three pieces of evidence. In the three original pieces of evidence, only one of them contains a small portion (10%) of total ignorance, which nevertheless is the least reliable by far and is not that important either. A commonsense answer to this question seems to be no, leading to doubt over the accuracy of the PCR5 results. In other words, the range of plausibility degrees between 53.34% and 95.38% may exaggerate the ambiguity of the probability to which proposition A is true, even though this range of plausibility might embrace the true range of the probability. Such exaggeration can also be found for other propositions, which could be misleading. For example, it does not look rational to conclude that proposition {a mathematical formula}{B,C} could be true with a plausibility degree range of 0.0463 {a mathematical formula}(0.0249+0.0182+0.0032) to as high as 0.4667 {a mathematical formula}(0.0249+0.0182+0.0388+0.031+0.0032+0.3506), since only {a mathematical formula}e2 points to it with a belief degree of 0.1 and {a mathematical formula}e3 only potentially points to it by a total degree of 0.1, both of which are much less important or reliable than {a mathematical formula}e1.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The results shown in Table 5 are straightforward to interpret as the ER rule constitutes a conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process. In fact, the bpas given in rows 2–4 of Table 5 do not change the specificity of any evidence at all. For example, the bpa for {a mathematical formula}e1, as shown in row 2 of Table 5, was generated for all {a mathematical formula}θ⊆Θ by multiplying the belief degrees shown in row 2 of Table 3 by the same coefficient {a mathematical formula}crw,1w1=0.8182 with {a mathematical formula}r1=0.8, {a mathematical formula}w1=0.9 and {a mathematical formula}crw,1=1/(1+w1−r1)=0.9091. The residual support for {a mathematical formula}e1 is assigned to the power set, given by {a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),1=crw,1(1−r1)=0.9091×(1−0.8)=0.1818, shown in the 2nd row and last column of Table 5. The sum of all elements in this row is one and the corresponding distribution is a belief distribution. The combined bpa shown by {a mathematical formula}mθ,e(2) was generated by combining the bpa for {a mathematical formula}e1 and the bpa for {a mathematical formula}e2 by means of the orthogonal sum of the two WBDRs characterised by {a mathematical formula}m˜θ,1 and {a mathematical formula}m˜θ,2. {a mathematical formula}mθ,e(2) is then combined with {a mathematical formula}m˜θ,3 to generate {a mathematical formula}mθ,e(3), which is then normalised to finally get {a mathematical formula}pθ,e(3). So the whole process of combining the three pieces of evidence is conjunctive. From this conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process, by looking at the figures in the last row of Table 5 and using Eq. (3), it can be concluded that
      </paragraph>
      <list>

        Proposition A is the most likely to occur with a high probability of 0.7061 to 0.8423;

       </list-item>
       <list-item label="•">

     Properties of the new ER rule
     <paragraph>
      As a conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process, the new ER rule holds a number of properties. In this section, we first analyse its inherent properties in order to facilitate its appropriate use. This is followed by showing that both the ER algorithm and Dempsterʼs rule are the special cases of the ER rule. We will then identify the missing definition of Dempsterʼs rule when pieces of evidence are completely conflicting, and finally show how to combine highly conflicting evidence through a so-called reliability perturbation analysis.
     </paragraph>
     <section label="5.1">
      Basic properties of the ER rule
      <paragraph>
       The ER rule is based on the orthogonal sum operated on WBDs (WBDRs). As such, it inherits the basic properties of the orthogonal sum operator and is both commutative and associative. Note however that these properties prevail only if WBDs (WBDRs) are combined recursively until all of them are combined before generating the overall combined degree of belief. These properties ensure that the ER rule can be used to combine multiple pieces of evidence in any order without changing the final result.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       From Eqs. (30), (32), (40) and (41), it is clear that if a piece of evidence is given a zero weight by a decision maker then the evidence will not play any role in the process of evidence combination. This means that adding a piece of evidence with zero weight into a list of evidence does not affect the combination result, so evidence with zero weight can be regarded as a neutral element. Note that the above property does not hold for a piece of evidence with zero reliability unless the evidence is subsequently given zero weight.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       However, the combination of two identical pieces of evidence using the ER rule does not normally produce the same evidence unless they each point to propositions equally. This is because the ER rule is a conjunctive rule and accumulates joint support. So a proposition with a high (low) degree of support from each identical piece of evidence will be reinforced (weakened) more than proportionally. Hence, the ER rule is not an idempotent process.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Apart from the above basic properties, the ER rule also satisfies synthesis axioms [41] which any rational reasoning process ought to follow. While these axioms should hold for a rigorous combination algorithm, an initial study suggested that human intuition or System 1 thinking [18] may not always follow such axioms [12]. Such violation may be due to various biases and irrationality in human judgements as studied and reported widely [1]. The accuracy of mental information processing under time pressure and participantsʼ lack of serious responsibility for the accuracy may also play a part in the reported violation of the axioms. The ER rule is developed for rational and rigorous reasoning but not as a descriptive model to explain human judgements. Its rigorous rationality check is thus the focus of this subsection.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We first restate the four synthesis axioms introduced previously [41] in the context of BDs and then prove that the ER rule provides a rational reasoning process for combining multiple pieces of independent evidence, in the sense that it satisfies the axioms.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Axiom 1">
       There should be no combined support for a proposition from multiple pieces of evidence if none of them supports the proposition at all.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Axiom 2">
       There should be full (100%) combined support for a proposition if all pieces of evidence each fully support the proposition.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Axiom 3">
       There should be full combined support for a set and its subsets of propositions, but no combined support for any other proposition if all pieces of evidence each fully support this same set and its subsets of propositions only.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Axiom 4">
       There should be some combined support for a proposition if at least one piece of evidence supports the proposition and no evidence is dominant.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In the rest of this subsection, we show that the ER rule satisfies all the above four synthesis axioms by proving the following four theorems. Suppose there are L pieces of independent evidence described by BDs, as defined by Eq. (20). Let {a mathematical formula}wi and {a mathematical formula}ri be the weight and reliability of the ith piece of evidence which satisfies the following conditions{a mathematical formula}

      Relationship with the ER algorithm
      <paragraph>
       The ER algorithm was developed for multiple criteria decision analysis in particular [41]. The ER rule is established primarily to generalise the ER algorithm for combination of evidence in general. It is therefore natural to conjecture that the ER algorithm should be a special case of the ER rule. This is indeed implied in the discussions in the previous sections. To formalise their relationship, the following corollary is provided.

      <paragraph label="Corollary 5">
       The ER algorithmThe ER algorithm is a special case of the ER rule when the reliability of each piece of evidence is equal to its weight which is normalised to be relative to each other as defined by Eq.(13).

       Relationship with Dempsterʼs rule
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Both Dempsterʼs rule and the ER rule originate from the orthogonal sum with the former operated on BDs and the latter on WBDs (or WBDRs). It is therefore natural that they should be closely related to each other. This is indeed the case, and their relationship can be formalised by the following corollary.

      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Corollary 6 provides a basis for identifying the missing definition in Dempsterʼs rule when it is used to combine pieces of evidence that are highly or completely conflicting. This can be achieved by exploring the ER rule through the analysis to be investigated in the rest of this section. We name it reliability perturbation analysis. The main idea can be traced back to the interpretation of conflict by Dubois and Prade [11] that if conflict between two information sources is high at least one of them may be unreliable. This interpretation was used to develop robust combination rules [14]. In this section, high conflict is treated as doubt over the reliability of information sources. The doubt is explored by means of perturbing the reliability of evidence as follows.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Let σ denote the total degree of collective support from two pieces of independent evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 that each are assumed to be fully reliable and have the weight of 1, or{a mathematical formula} A small σ thus means a high level of conflict between {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2. Suppose τ is a small real number that means “unlikely” cognitively such as {a mathematical formula}τ=0.01.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 are each fully reliable and their collective support to the same proposition is deemed to be cognitively likely, i.e. {a mathematical formula}σ&gt;τ, Dempsterʼs rule can be applied to combine their BDs. If they are completely conflicting, i.e. {a mathematical formula}σ=0, it is conjectured that the weighted average rule should be applied to combine their BDs. This conjecture is based on the observation that the conjunction of {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 will be empty if they are completely conflicting, which is a special case that {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 are mutually exclusive. It is widely accepted that the combination of two pieces of mutually exclusive evidence is additive.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If {a mathematical formula}τ⩾σ&gt;0, {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 are deemed to be highly conflicting. In this case, to reflect the above interpretation of conflict, the reliabilities of {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 ({a mathematical formula}ri for {a mathematical formula}i=1,2) are perturbed (or reduced slightly) to cast doubt over their reliabilities rather than assume that {a mathematical formula}ri has to become very small or zero simply because {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 are in high conflict. For example, the following reliability perturbation function can be used to analyse conflict resolution,{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In Eq. (48), {a mathematical formula}bi is referred to as a reliability perturbation coefficient, describing the level of the Decision Makerʼs (DMʼs) doubt over the reliability of the ith piece of evidence in light of its high conflict with other evidence and also the DMʼs attitudes towards individual and collective support. A large {a mathematical formula}bi means a big reduction in reliability {a mathematical formula}ri. k is introduced into the equation to ensure that when {a mathematical formula}σ→0 or {a mathematical formula}σ→τ, {a mathematical formula}ri(σ) will approach one not faster than σ approaching zero or τ. Note that we have {a mathematical formula}ri(σ)=1 at {a mathematical formula}σ=0 or {a mathematical formula}σ=τ and {a mathematical formula}0⩽ri(σ)&lt;1 when {a mathematical formula}0&lt;σ&lt;τ. Also note that {a mathematical formula}ri(σ) is the smallest at {a mathematical formula}σ=τ2. In other words, the maximal level of doubt over the reliability of {a mathematical formula}ei is {a mathematical formula}biτk which can happen when {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 become unlikely to support a proposition collectively. It should be noted that what reliability perturbation function should be used is problem specific. As a rule of thumb, a reliability perturbation function should be a continuous function having the following properties: (1) {a mathematical formula}0⩽ri(σ)⩽1; (2) {a mathematical formula}ri(σ)=1 at {a mathematical formula}σ=0 or {a mathematical formula}σ=τ; (3) when {a mathematical formula}σ→0 or {a mathematical formula}σ→τ, there should be {a mathematical formula}ri(σ)→1 at a speed no more than σ approaching zero or τ.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For the reliability perturbation function given by Eq. (48), it can be shown that the relative weights for {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 when {a mathematical formula}σ→0 is given by{a mathematical formula} Note from Eq. (49) that a special case is {a mathematical formula}w¯i=wi/∑l=1Lwl if all L pieces of evidence are deemed to be equally reliable, whether they are in high conflict or not.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The above discussions lead to the following more detailed definition of the ER rule to combine joint support from two pieces of independent evidence that are each fully reliable,{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} In Eq. (51){a mathematical formula}ri(σ) is calculated by Eq. (48). In Eq. (50), the second formula is the application of Corollary 6, the third formula is the application of the ER rule given by Corollary 3 for a specific reliability perturbation function {a mathematical formula}ri(σ), and formula (4) is based on the above conjecture of the weighted average rule. While the conjecture needs to be proved rigorously, we will conduct simulation study in next section to show that formula (3) converges to formula (2) when {a mathematical formula}σ→τ and to formula (4) when {a mathematical formula}σ→0. As such, the special case of the ER rule given by Eqs. (50) and (51) completes and enhances Dempsterʼs rule.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Resolution of high conflict among evidence depends on how evidence is gathered and how the DM responds to a situation where evidence is in high conflict. It is important to examine these key factors in order to decide what reliability perturbation function should be used to analyse and resolve conflict. As illustrated by the simulation study reported in next section, for example, in the function shown in Eq. (48), the choice of the parameters {a mathematical formula}bi, τ and k requires specific knowledge in a problem domain and depends on the interpretation of high conflict among evidence. In other words, there is no unique or optimal strategy for resolution of high conflict among evidence.

       Simulation study for conflict resolution
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The proposed reliability perturbation analysis can be used to conduct simulation study to demonstrate how the ER rule can be used to facilitate resolution of high conflict among evidence. Since Zadehʼs “counter-intuitive” example [45], [46], [47] is so influential that it has put Dempsterʼs rule in doubt over the last several decades, it seems necessary to analyse this example in detail to clarify the doubt.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Table 6 show a generalised version of Zadehʼs example with {a mathematical formula}1⩾δ⩾0 in the table. Zadehʼs example is a special case with {a mathematical formula}δ=0.01. Note from Eq. (47) that there is {a mathematical formula}σ=δ2 for the example of Table 6. In the long debate over the validity of Dempsterʼs rule, there have been two main different types of view, one opposing it and the other supporting it. The main point of the opposing view is that how on earth proposition B could be surely supported when each of the two pieces of evidence only points to the proposition with such a low probability of 0.01. In this view, the probability of 0.01 may already mean “unlikely”. On the other hand, 0.01 may still mean “likely” in the supporting view. Is either of these views correct and why? In the ER rule given by Eqs. (50) and (51), the answer is clear. If {a mathematical formula}δ=0.01 means “unlikely”, then {a mathematical formula}σ=δ2=10−4 must mean “highly unlikely”; so it is inappropriate to apply Dempsterʼs rule in this case. On the other hand, if {a mathematical formula}δ=0.01 means “likely”, does a probability of {a mathematical formula}10−4 still mean “likely”? If not, it is inappropriate to apply Dempsterʼs rule either.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The resolution of the above conflict requires extra information from the DM. Without loss of generality, suppose {a mathematical formula}τ=0.01, {a mathematical formula}k=1, {a mathematical formula}b1=b2=1 and {a mathematical formula}w1=w2=1. For the example shown in Table 6, these parameter settings mean that: (1) {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 are deemed to be equally reliable although in conflict (or {a mathematical formula}b1=b2=1); (2) their reliability becomes doubtful at {a mathematical formula}δ=0.1 (or {a mathematical formula}σ=δ2=0.01=τ) or less; (3) the most severe doubt is deemed to happen at {a mathematical formula}δ=0.01 (or {a mathematical formula}σ=δ2=0.0001=τ2) when both {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 become unlikely to support proposition B; (4) any loss of reliability for either {a mathematical formula}e1 or {a mathematical formula}e2 is no more than 1% (or {a mathematical formula}b1τk=b2τk=0.01). For these typical settings, the changes of {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2), {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2) and {a mathematical formula}pC,e(2) with respect to δ are shown in Fig. 1, generated by using the third formula in Eq. (50) for {a mathematical formula}τ⩾σ&gt;0.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       As shown but hardly visible in Fig. 1, because {a mathematical formula}b1 and {a mathematical formula}b2 are both set to be 1, {a mathematical formula}r1(σ) and {a mathematical formula}r2(σ) are only perturbed slightly with {a mathematical formula}1⩾r1(σ)=r2(σ)⩾0.99 ({a mathematical formula}σ=δ2), decreasing when {a mathematical formula}1−δ∈[0.9,0.99] ({a mathematical formula}δ∈[0.01,0.1]) monotonically, and increasing for {a mathematical formula}1−δ∈[0.99,1] ({a mathematical formula}δ∈[0,0.01]) monotonically. Note that at {a mathematical formula}δ=0.01 (or {a mathematical formula}σ=0.0001), {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2)=0.0149 and {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2)=pC,e(2)=0.4925, and when {a mathematical formula}δ→0 they converge to the same result as generated by using the weighted average operation (the fourth formula in Eq. (50) for {a mathematical formula}σ=0), or {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2)=0 and {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2)=pC,e(2)=0.5, with {a mathematical formula}w¯1=w¯2=0.5 in this case.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Various types of simulation study can be conducted to validate the ER rule by changing the settings of the parameters. For example, Fig. 2.1 shows the perturbation of the reliability {a mathematical formula}r1(σ)(r2(σ)) of {a mathematical formula}e1(e2) with respect to both {a mathematical formula}b1(b2=b1) and δ with {a mathematical formula}τ=0.01, {a mathematical formula}k=1, {a mathematical formula}w1=w2=1, and {a mathematical formula}r1(σ)=r2(σ). The change of the reliability is negligible for {a mathematical formula}b1⩽1, becomes greater for large {a mathematical formula}b1, and is the greatest for {a mathematical formula}b1=100=1/τ.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Fig. 2.2, Fig. 2.3 show respectively the changes of {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2)(pC,e(2)) and {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2) corresponding to Fig. 2.1. It is worth noting that the curves in Fig. 2.2, Fig. 2.3 can be explained as different attitudes towards individual support for A or C and collective support for B when the two pieces of evidence are in high conflict. A large {a mathematical formula}b1 (e.g. {a mathematical formula}100⩾b1&gt;0.3) can mean an optimistic attitude to individual support and a pessimistic attitude to collective support; a small {a mathematical formula}b1 (e.g. {a mathematical formula}0.3&gt;b1⩾0) can mean exactly the opposite; a medium {a mathematical formula}b1 of around 0.3 can mean a neutral attitude to both in this example. The curves in both Fig. 2.2, Fig. 2.3 for {a mathematical formula}b1=0.01 and 100 envelope all the combined beliefs for A, B and C for all the possible values of {a mathematical formula}b1. For example, at {a mathematical formula}δ=0.01, {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2)(pC,e(2)) is between 0.33 for {a mathematical formula}b1=0.01 and 0.495 for {a mathematical formula}b1=100, and {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2) is between 0.01 for {a mathematical formula}b1=100 and 0.34 for {a mathematical formula}b1=0.01, with {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2)+pB,e(2)+pC,e(2)=1.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The results of Fig. 2.1, Fig. 2.2, Fig. 2.3 can be used to explain how the conflict in Zadehʼs example, where {a mathematical formula}δ=0.01, could be resolved in different ways. For example, the use of the PCR5 rule leads to {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2)=0.026 and {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2)=pC,e(2)=0.487[14], which is about the same as the results of {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2)=0.0262 and {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2)=pC,e(2)=0.4869 generated by using the ER rule with {a mathematical formula}b1=b2=0.3. This is not surprising as the PCR5 rule employs a proportional strategy to allocate beliefs in conflict, which is similar to a neutral attitude towards individual and collective support, although the PCR5 rule is not a probabilistic reasoning process.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Fig. 3 shows the changes of the combined beliefs with respect to δ ({a mathematical formula}σ=δ2) for the different weights of {a mathematical formula}w1=1 and {a mathematical formula}w2=0.5 with {a mathematical formula}τ=0.01, {a mathematical formula}k=1 and {a mathematical formula}b1=b2=1. In this case, {a mathematical formula}e1 is given a relative weight that is twice as large as that given to {a mathematical formula}e2, so from Eq. (49) we get {a mathematical formula}w¯1=0.6667 and {a mathematical formula}w¯2=0.3333. As shown in Fig. 3, when {a mathematical formula}δ→0{a mathematical formula}(σ→0), {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2), {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2) and {a mathematical formula}pC,e(2) converge to 0.6667, 0 and 0.3333 respectively, just as expected by the weighted average operation of the fourth formula in Eq. (50).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Fig. 4 show the same case as Fig. 3 except that {a mathematical formula}b1=1 and {a mathematical formula}b2=2, so that {a mathematical formula}e2 is put in doubt twice as much as {a mathematical formula}e1, leading to {a mathematical formula}w¯1=0.8 and {a mathematical formula}w¯2=0.2 from Eq. (49). Indeed we have {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2)=0.8, {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2)=0 and {a mathematical formula}pC,e(2)=0.2 when {a mathematical formula}δ→0{a mathematical formula}(σ→0).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Finally, it is worth illustrating how the ER rule behaves for conflict resolution in Zadehʼs example at {a mathematical formula}δ=0.01 with various speeds of convergence (or various k values). The results are shown in Table 7, where it is assumed that {a mathematical formula}b1=b2=1, {a mathematical formula}τ=0.01 and {a mathematical formula}w1=w2=1. As shown in Table 7, for various k, {a mathematical formula}r1(σ) ({a mathematical formula}=r2(σ)) is perturbed very differently, but the values of {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2), {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2) and {a mathematical formula}pC,e(2) are kept almost unchanged, showing that the convergence is fairly robust. It can be shown that this is also the case for {a mathematical formula}b1,b2⩾1. For small {a mathematical formula}b1 ({a mathematical formula}b2), the values of {a mathematical formula}pA,e(2), {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2) and {a mathematical formula}pC,e(2) are more sensitive to the value of k, as shown in Fig. 5 for {a mathematical formula}0.1⩾b1=b2⩾0.01. Note that {a mathematical formula}pC,e(2)=pA,e(2) and {a mathematical formula}pB,e(2)=1−pA,e(2)−pC,e(2). This shows that it is important to choose an appropriate reliability perturbation function for conflict resolution if {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 are still deemed to be highly reliable when in high conflict.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In the above analyses, it should be noted that for small {a mathematical formula}b1 (or {a mathematical formula}b2) the change of reliability for {a mathematical formula}e1 (or {a mathematical formula}e2) is negligible, so the reliability is just perturbed rather than necessarily reduced. In this regard, the use of the ER rule as shown in Eq. (50) does not mean that reliability for any evidence must be sacrificed for conflict resolution. Although the reliability perturbation analysis leads to the establishment of the ER rule for combining pieces of fully reliable evidence that are highly or completely conflicting, the analysis is not a rigorous proof that the ER rule is the only legitimate probabilistic reasoning process for combining this type of evidence. To find such a proof or identify any other probabilistic reasoning processes is a topic for further research.
