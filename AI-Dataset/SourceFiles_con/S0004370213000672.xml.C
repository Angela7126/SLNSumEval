    Interpolative and extrapolative reasoning in propositional theories using qualitative knowledge about conceptual spaces.
   </title>
   <abstract>
    Many logical theories are incomplete, in the sense that non-trivial conclusions about particular situations cannot be derived from them using classical deduction. In this paper, we show how the ideas of interpolation and extrapolation, which are of crucial importance in many numerical domains, can be applied in symbolic settings to alleviate this issue in the case of propositional categorization rules. Our method is based on (mainly) qualitative descriptions of how different properties are conceptually related, where we identify conceptual relations between properties with spatial relations between regions in Gärdenfors conceptual spaces. The approach is centred around the view that categorization rules can often be seen as approximations of linear (or at least monotonic) mappings between conceptual spaces. We use this assumption to justify that whenever the antecedents of a number of rules stand in a relationship that is invariant under linear (or monotonic) transformations, their consequents should also stand in that relationship. A form of interpolative and extrapolative reasoning can then be obtained by applying this idea to the relations of betweenness and parallelism respectively. After discussing these ideas at the semantic level, we introduce a number of inference rules to characterize interpolative and extrapolative reasoning at the syntactic level, and show their soundness and completeness w.r.t. the proposed semantics. Finally, we show that the considered inference problems are PSPACE-hard in general, while implementations in polynomial time are possible under some relatively mild assumptions.

      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      Symbolic approaches to knowledge representation typically start from a finite set of natural language labels, which are associated to atomic propositions (in propositional settings), to predicates (in first-order settings), or to atomic concepts (in description logics). The meaning of these labels is then expressed implicitly by encoding how the corresponding propositions are related to each other using a logical theory. Clearly, such a logical theory can only capture a small fraction of the actual meaning of the labels at the cognitive level. Formalizing commonsense reasoning then boils down to developing principled approaches to extend or refine logical inference, such that the conclusions that can be derived from a logical theory become, in some way, closer to what we infer at the cognitive level. Some approaches to non-monotonic reasoning [1], for instance, deal with exceptions by assuming that rules only apply to typical instances of the concepts involved or are only valid in normal situations, even though these notions of typicality and normality are not explicitly expressed at the symbolic level. Essentially, such approaches are non-monotonic because the factual knowledge they work on is incomplete: we may know that Tweety is a bird, but not that it is a penguin. Later observations may enrich our factual knowledge base, necessitating a revision of some of the assumptions that were made (e.g. Tweety can fly). As another form of commonsense reasoning, in this paper we look at techniques for dealing with a lack of generic knowledge. For the ease of presentation, we will assume that generic knowledge is expressed as a set of propositional rules. We are then interested in situations where factual knowledge is, in principle, complete, but where none of the given rules applies to the situation at hand. For instance, we may know that it is advisable to rest (i) when feeling nauseated and having a high fever, and (ii) when feeling nauseated without any fever, but not have any information about what is advisable in case of nausea with a mild fever.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Similarity-based reasoning Humans can often cope with such a lack of knowledge by drawing analogies, or by resorting to knowledge about similar situations [2], [3]. This observation has led to a number of theories of approximate reasoning, which are mainly based on the premise that from similar conditions we can draw similar conclusions. Most notably, a large number of fuzzy set based approaches have been proposed that build on the idea that the more a situation is compatible with the fuzzy labels in the antecedent of a rule, the more it should be compatible with the fuzzy labels in its consequent. Such rules, called gradual rules in [4], are based on a measure of similarity that is implicit in the definition of the membership functions of the fuzzy labels. Related to gradual rules, certainty rules [4] rather encode that the more similar a situation is to the fuzzy labels in the antecedent of a rule, the more certain that the consequent holds. Some related approaches avoid the use of fuzzy sets and rather encode similarity assessments in an explicit way (e.g. [5], [6], [7]). Given that {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}a→b hold, such methods allow to derive b with a certainty that depends on the degree of similarity {a mathematical formula}sim(a,a1).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Despite the intuitive appeal of similarity-based approaches, and their popularity in the context of control and classification problems, they face a number of difficulties when used for commonsense reasoning. First, quantitative similarity degrees can be hard to obtain in practice, a problem which is aggravated by the observation that similarity judgements are context-dependent [8], [9]. The quantitative nature of similarity degrees also makes it difficult to encode rules, e.g. exactly how similar should a given premise {a mathematical formula}a1 be to the antecedent of the rule {a mathematical formula}a→b to derive b with a given certainty? Finally, similarity based methods tend to lack a principled way of dealing with conjunctions. For instance, assume that the rule {a mathematical formula}a∧b→c and the facts {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}b1 are known to hold, and moreover {a mathematical formula}sim(a,a1)=0.6 and {a mathematical formula}sim(b,b1)=0.4. To assess whether we can plausibly derive {a mathematical formula}a1∧b1→c using similarity based reasoning, we would need to assess to what extent {a mathematical formula}a1∧b1 is similar to {a mathematical formula}a∧b. Usually, a truth-functional approach is assumed, assuming e.g. {a mathematical formula}sim(a∧b,a1∧b1)=min(sim(a,a1),sim(b,b1)) or {a mathematical formula}sim(a∧b,a1∧b1)=sim(a,a1)⋅sim(b,b1). Such views, however, are hard to justify from a cognitive point of view.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Betweenness The aforementioned shortcomings of similarity-based reasoning seem closely related to the use of degrees. A key observation is that in practice, similarity-based approaches are often used to implement a form of interpolation of symbolic rules: given the rules {a mathematical formula}a1→b1 and {a mathematical formula}a3→b3, and a premise {a mathematical formula}a2 which is known to be between {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}a3, a conclusion is obtained between {a mathematical formula}b1 and {a mathematical formula}b3. Interpolative inference, however, can also be implemented in a qualitative way, taking betweenness as primitive rather than similarity. Indeed, it suffices to know which propositions are conceptually between {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}a3 and which propositions are between {a mathematical formula}b1 and {a mathematical formula}b3. For instance, since a mild fever is conceptually between high fever and no fever, in the earlier example we conclude that resting is advised in case of nausea with a mild fever. This basic form of interpolative inference can then be further refined, depending on the kind of background information that is available about the conceptual relationships between the propositions (labels). For example, if we know that {a mathematical formula}a2 is closer to {a mathematical formula}a1 than to {a mathematical formula}a3, we may insist that the conclusion should also be closer to {a mathematical formula}b1 than to {a mathematical formula}b3. The idea of interpolating symbolic knowledge can also be extended to various forms of extrapolative inference, as is illustrated in the following example.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Example 1">
      Consider the following knowledge base, containing observations about the comfort level of different housing options:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Clearly, this knowledge base is incomplete. For instance, we have no information at all about the comfort level of a villa in the centre. However, from the rules that are provided, it seems reasonable to assume that villas are more comfortable than apartments (by comparing (2) and (3)) and that housing in the centre is more comfortable than housing in the suburbs (by comparing (3) and (4)). As a form of extrapolative inference, this leads us to conclude that a villa in the centre would at least be as comfortable as a villa in the suburbs, i.e. either luxurious or exclusive. We may also wonder about apartments in the outskirts of the city. As living in the outskirts is conceptually between living in the centre and living in the suburbs, from (3) and (4) we may reasonably assume, as a form of interpolative inference, that the comfort level of an apartment in the outskirts would be between basic and very-comfortable.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Objectives of the paper The aim of this paper is to develop a principled approach to interpolative and extrapolative reasoning, as a general way to avoid the use of degrees when dealing with incomplete generic knowledge. In particular, we address the following research questions:
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item label="1.">
       How can interpolative and extrapolative inference be formalized? What are its computational properties and how can automated inference procedures be implemented?
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="2.">
       What is the nature of the background knowledge that is needed to support interpolative and extrapolative reasoning?
      </list-item>
      <list-item label="3.">
       What is the semantic justification for interpolation and extrapolation? While most approaches to non-monotonic reasoning have a principled semantic foundation, typically based on the notion of preferred worlds [10], [1] or the idea of stable models [11], [12], this is to a much lesser extent the case for current methods that deal with incompleteness of rule bases.
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      The underlying idea is that among all possible refinements of a given knowledge base we favour those which are most regular, an intuition which will be formalized using the theory of conceptual spaces [13]. This theory posits that natural language labels can be identified with a convex region in a particular geometric space — called a conceptual space — whose dimensions correspond to cognitively meaningful qualities. Using conceptual spaces, notions such as betweenness can be given a clear geometric interpretation, which allows us to derive a semantic characterization of various interpolative and extrapolative inference relations. It is important to note, however, that although conceptual spaces are crucial to justify our approach, in practical applications, we do not actually require that the conceptual space representations of properties are available. In particular, the inference mechanism itself will only require qualitative knowledge about how the conceptual representations of labels are spatially related. For instance, to support a basic interpolative inference relation, it is only required that we know which labels are conceptually between which other labels. Furthermore note that this form of commonsense reasoning will actually be monotonic: increasing the rule base may allow us to refine earlier conclusions, but will never violate them. In contrast, in the setting of non-monotonic reasoning, increasing the factual knowledge may lead us to consider different rules to be applicable, as more specific rules may override more general ones.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Depending on the considered application, the required qualitative knowledge can be provided by an expert or it can be derived automatically using data-driven techniques. In the first case, an expert may choose to manually encode some rules, and rely on interpolation or extrapolation to avoid the need for a complete specification of the considered domain (e.g. explicitly enumerating the comfort level for all housing types and all location types). The resulting inference relation would be guaranteed to provide sound conclusions, although for those parts of the domain that were not explicitly modelled by the expert, available information may be less precise (but not trivial). In the second case, where data-driven techniques are used to obtain background information about the conceptual relationship of different labels (e.g. by analysing documents from the web), the aim is rather to generate plausible conclusions from imperfect conceptual background knowledge. In this way, we can combine the rigour of a logic-based framework with the flexibility of data-driven methods. The commonsense aspect of the approach thus lies in the possibility to go beyond classical deduction by taking advantage of structural domain knowledge that has been induced from data, without resorting to purely statistical techniques as in [14].
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Organization The paper is structured as follows. After discussing related work in Section 2, we present a high-level overview of our approach in Section 3. Section 4 subsequently discusses in more detail how qualitative spatial descriptions of conceptual spaces can be used to encode the conceptual relationship of different atomic properties. Next, in Section 5 we investigate how conceptual relations between atomic properties can be leveraged to conceptual relations between unions and intersections of properties (represented as sets of vectors of properties), and how the latter conceptual relations can be used to refine a given rule base at the semantic level. In Section 6 we then focus on the syntactic level: we introduce a set of inference rules and show that they are sound and complete w.r.t. the semantics from Section 5. Section 7 analyses the computational complexity of interpolative and extrapolative reasoning and presents an implementation method. In Section 8 we present some further thoughts on how to apply our method in practice, and in particular on the question of how to handle inconsistencies that are introduced by our method. We present our conclusions and a number of directions for future work in Section 9. Finally, note that this paper forms a substantially extended and revised version of [15]. Among others, we now provide a complete characterization of extrapolative inference and include the idea of comparative distance (whereas only the interpolative inference relation was characterized in [15]). We moreover present an implementation method, as well as the proofs.

      Our work is clearly related to existing approaches in cognition and knowledge representation that are based on a spatial representation of knowledge. However, our approach also touches upon several other domains, including non-monotonic reasoning, similarity-based reasoning, regularization in machine learning, and qualitative physics. We briefly clarify the relationship with each of these domains.

       Spatial representations of meaning
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       One of the central motivations of this paper is to approach commonsense reasoning by abandoning the idea that atomic propositions are independent from each other, in favour of a view which allows them to be conceptually related in a way that cannot be fully expressed at the logical level. Although atomic propositions are traditionally assumed to be independent, several 20th century philosophers have argued against such a view. Wittgenstein [16] was among the first to realize that sometimes we need more than a purely syntactic approach to logic, considering that atomic logical formulas may exclude each other while they are not contradictory. A statement such as place P is green at time T and place P it is blue at time T is treated as nonsensical by Wittgenstein rather than false, where he writes “It is, of course, a deficiency of our notation that it does not prevent the formation of such nonsensical constructions, and a perfect notation will have to exclude such structures by definite rules of syntax” [16]. In the same spirit, Carnap [17] uses the notion of an attribute space to group predicates of the same type. An attribute space is an abstract representation of a certain domain. For instance, the attribute space of colours consists of all (infinitely many) colour instances. In practice, these attribute spaces are usually described using a finite set of labels, which correspond to predicates at the logical level. By thus partitioning the predicates into separate attribute spaces, one can restrict interpretations to those that make exactly one predicate true from each attribute space, for any given individual. Quine [18] uses the related notion of a quality space to characterize similarity, putting forward the view that similarity cannot be defined in logical terms, and thus requires a deeper representation of atomic propositions. These works have led to the more recent development of conceptual spaces [13] by Gärdenfors, in an attempt to use the idea of a spatial representation of meaning to tackle problems in artificial intelligence (AI), among others. Conceptual spaces will be discussed in more detail in Section 4.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Apart from the work on conceptual spaces, the idea of assuming a spatial representation to reason about concepts also underlies [19], where an approach to integrate heterogeneous databases is proposed based on spatial relations between concepts. This approach starts from the observation that types from one database may not have an exact counterpart in another database. Conceptual relations between types are therefore considered which express e.g. that all typical instances of type A belong to type B but some instances of type A may be outside B. Such relations can formally be modelled as egg/yolk relations, which are a form of qualitative spatial relations between ill-defined spatial regions. Somewhat related, in [20] we presented a general method for merging conflicting propositional knowledge bases coming from different sources, based on the view that different sources may have a slightly different understanding of a given label. The different ways in which such a label may be understood are encoded in terms of four primitive relations that essentially correspond to qualitative spatial relations between (unknown) geometric representations of the labels. Although the kind of spatial relations encountered in these existing works are mainly mereotopological, qualitative spatial reasoning about betweenness is an active topic of research [21], [22].

        Non-monotonic reasoning
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        In general, several facets of commonsense reasoning have been extensively studied within the field of AI. Of particular interest is the work on System P for reasoning about rules with exceptions [1]. In this approach, a non-monotonic consequence relation is defined by encoding axiomatically how new rules may be derived from existing rules. In particular, the non-monotonic consequence relation {an inline-figure} is defined by the following inference rules:
       </paragraph>
       <list>
        <list-item>
         {a mathematical formula}α{an inline-figure}α
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
         If {a mathematical formula}α≡α′ and {a mathematical formula}α{an inline-figure}β then {a mathematical formula}α′{an inline-figure}β
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
         If {a mathematical formula}β⊨β′ and {a mathematical formula}α|∼β then {a mathematical formula}α{an inline-figure}β′
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
         If {a mathematical formula}α{an inline-figure}γ and {a mathematical formula}β{an inline-figure}γ then {a mathematical formula}α∨β{an inline-figure}γ
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
         If {a mathematical formula}α{an inline-figure}β and {a mathematical formula}α{an inline-figure}γ then {a mathematical formula}α∧β{an inline-figure}γ
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
         If {a mathematical formula}α∧β{an inline-figure}γ and {a mathematical formula}α{an inline-figure}β then {a mathematical formula}α{an inline-figure}γ
        </list-item>
       </list>
       <paragraph>
        where ≡ and ⊨ denote equivalence and entailment in classical logic, respectively. Intuitively, {a mathematical formula}α{an inline-figure}β means that in normal situations where α holds, it is also the case that β holds. The normative approach by System P about how a non-monotonic consequence relation should behave has been very influential in the field of non-monotonic reasoning. While the purpose of our paper is not to study non-monotonic consequence relations, our approach does resemble System P in that our goal is also to produce new rules, which are appropriate to a given situation. However, whereas System P is concerned with finding the most specific rules that are compatible with our (incomplete) knowledge about the situation at hand, in interpolative and extrapolative reasoning there is no genuine issue of incompleteness at the factual level. Rather, we are interested in situations where the given situation is not explicitly covered by a rule base, but is intermediate between, or analogous to situations that are covered.

        Similarity-based reasoning
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        Somewhat related, several authors have studied similarity-based consequence relations which are based on the intuition that α approximately entails β iff every model of α is similar to some model of β[23], [6], [24]. In [25], for instance, a similarity-based consequence relation is contrasted with the consequence relation from System P, revealing that similarity-based reasoning satisfies monotonicity and most of the axioms of System P, but not the cut rule. More generally, a large number of authors have proposed systems for approximate, similarity-based reasoning within the field of fuzzy set theory. Most of these works are based on Zadehʼs generalized modus ponens [26] (but see [27] for an early example of a more qualitative approach), which allows us to derive a fuzzy restriction on the value of variable Y from the knowledge that if X is A then Y is B and X is{a mathematical formula}A′ with A, {a mathematical formula}A′ and B fuzzy sets. The basic idea is that the more A is similar to {a mathematical formula}A′, the more the inferred restriction on Y will be close to B. When this idea is applied to a set of parallel rules, such that the fuzzy sets in the antecedents of the rules overlap, it leads to a form of interpolative reasoning. Furthermore, several authors have proposed methods to interpolate fuzzy rule bases in general, i.e. without requiring overlap of the fuzzy sets; we refer to [28] for a recent overview. While these techniques are also about interpolating rules, they differ from our approach in a number of ways. First, they are mostly restricted to uni-dimensional, numerical domains, and they require that quantitative representations of symbolic labels be available in the form of fuzzy sets. Furthermore, they treat logical connectives, such as conjunctions in the antecedent, in a truth-functional (and therefore heuristic) way.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        In [29], a logic called CSL is introduced which has a construct {a mathematical formula}A⇇B denoting all objects that are more similar to instances of concept A than to instances of concept B. The qualitative nature of this logic brings it closer to the approach we present in this paper. As it is based exclusively on closeness, and not on other aspects of spatial localization such as being in between, CSL is not directly suitable as a basis for interpolative or extrapolative reasoning. Interestingly, however, as a result of this restriction, CSL can be described using a preferential semantics [30].

        Regularity
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        In the propositional setting, the idea of interpolation and extrapolation has been studied in [31], but from a rather different angle. In particular, the paper discusses how the belief that certain propositions hold at certain moments in time can be extended to beliefs about other moments in time, using persistence assumptions as a starting point. Nonetheless, as in our paper, the main idea is to use general meta-principles to find those completion(s) of a knowledge base that are most regular in some sense.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        The idea of regularity can also be found in work on analogical proportions. An analogical proportion is an expression of the form {a mathematical formula}a:b::c:d which reads as a is to b as c is to d. If a, b, c and d are binary propositions, this can be formalized as {a mathematical formula}(a→b≡c→d)∧(b→a≡d→c) (see [32]). In [33], an approach to classification is outlined which uses the view that, as a form of regularity, the more of the condition attributes of three training items form an analogical proportion with the condition attributes of the item to be classified, the more it becomes likely that also the decision attribute should form an analogical proportion. Using connectives from multi-valued logic, analogical proportions can be defined for graded propositions, which allows us to extend this idea to numerical attributes. In [34], an extrapolative inference mechanism has been proposed which is based on such analogical proportions between graded proportions. The latter technique can be seen as a special case of the approach we develop in this paper. In this paper, however, we also consider forms of interpolative and extrapolative reasoning that are not based on analogical proportions, and the proposed techniques are moreover not restricted to linearly ordered domains.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        More generally, the idea of regularity appears in various forms in learning settings. In graph regularization [35], for instance, the desire for regularity is even made explicit in the form of a graph which connects instances that should receive a similar classification. In other approaches, the idea of regularity is implicit in the choice of the underlying classification functions that are allowed (e.g. being restricted to hyperplanes in the case of support vector machines), and is thus imposed to avoid overfitting. As an example of another domain where the idea of regularity surfaces, [36] presents an approach to derive a preference ordering, starting from a set of generic preferences. To choose a specific ordering among all those satisfying the constraints, the principle of minimal specificity from possibility theory is adopted as a way to avoid introducing any irregularities that have not been explicitly specified as constraints.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        The notion of matrix abduction, proposed in [37] is also related to our work in its use of regularity as a criterion to complete missing values, although it operates at a lower-level representation. Specifically, consider a matrix whose rows correspond to objects and whose columns correspond to binary features, such that exactly one entry of the matrix is ‘?’, corresponding to a missing value, and all the other entries are 0 or 1. Then [37] proposes to choose the missing value such that the regularity of the matrix is maximized. Specifically, a partial order relation is induced from both of the possible completions of the matrix, and the completion which is favoured is the one whose associated partial order relation is most natural in some sense. Note that, somewhat related, in abductive reasoning for causal diagnosis, it is also common to favour the simplest explanations (e.g. preferring single fault diagnoses to explain observed symptoms).

       <paragraph>
        Finally, there is some resemblance between the inference procedure presented in this paper and the early work on qualitative reasoning about physical systems [38], [39], which deals with monotonicity constraints such as “if the value of x increases, then (all things being equal) the value of y decreases”. Our inference procedure differs from these approaches as the domains we reason about do not need to be linearly ordered. Moreover, in the special case of linearly ordered domains, we assume no prior information about which partial mappings are increasing and which are decreasing.

      Overview of the approach
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      In this section, we introduce some notations and basic concepts that will be used throughout the paper. We also present the main intuitions of our approach at an informal level.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Let {a mathematical formula}A1,…,An be finite sets of labels, where each set {a mathematical formula}Ai corresponds to a certain type of properties{sup:1} (e.g. colours), and the labels of {a mathematical formula}Ai correspond to particular properties of the corresponding type (e.g. red, green, orange). The labels in {a mathematical formula}Ai are assumed to correspond to jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD) properties. Note that each element {a mathematical formula}(a1,…,an) from the Cartesian product {a mathematical formula}A=A1×⋯×An then corresponds to a maximally descriptive specification of the properties that some object or situation may satisfy. We furthermore assume that {a mathematical formula}Ai∩Aj=∅ for {a mathematical formula}i≠j. We will refer to the sets {a mathematical formula}Ai as attribute domains, and to their elements as attributes or, when used in a propositional language, as atoms.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We consider propositional rules of the form {a mathematical formula}β→γ, where β and γ are propositional formulas, built in the usual way from the set of atoms {a mathematical formula}A1∪⋯∪An and the connectives ∧ and ∨. Note that we do not need to explicitly consider negation, as the negation of an atom {a mathematical formula}a∈Ai corresponds to the disjunction of the atoms in {a mathematical formula}Ai∖{a}. We say that an element {a mathematical formula}(a1,…,an)∈A is a model of a formula (or a rule) α, written {a mathematical formula}(a1,…,an)⊨Aα if the corresponding propositional interpretation {a mathematical formula}{a1,…,an} is a model of α in the usual sense, where we see propositional interpretations as sets containing all atoms that are interpreted as true. For formulas (or rules or sets of rules) {a mathematical formula}α1 and {a mathematical formula}α2, we say that {a mathematical formula}α1 entails {a mathematical formula}α2, written {a mathematical formula}α1⊨Aα2 if for every {a mathematical formula}ω∈A, {a mathematical formula}ω⊨Aα1 implies {a mathematical formula}ω⊨Aα2. Note that the notion of entailment we consider is classical entailment, modulo the assumption that the propositions in each set {a mathematical formula}Ai are JEPD.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Example 2">
      Consider the following attribute domains:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}A1 lists the housing types that are possible in the given context, {a mathematical formula}A2 provides a coarser description of some of these housing types, and {a mathematical formula}A3 and {a mathematical formula}A4 contain the labels that are used to describe housing sizes and comfort levels respectively. Note that subscripts are used for the housing options {a mathematical formula}row-house and {a mathematical formula}semi-detached to ensure that different attribute domains are disjoint. When there is no cause for confusion, we will omit these subscripts. The following set of rules R provides a partial specification of how these attribute domains are related to each other:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where some labels are abbreviated for the ease of presentation. For example {a mathematical formula}(villa,detached,large,lux) is a model of each of these rules. Note that the only conclusions that can be derived from R are more or less trivial, e.g.{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Note that (9) follows from our assumption that the labels in an attribute domain are exhaustive.

       A rule base R over the atoms in {a mathematical formula}A usually only provides an incomplete specification of how the given attribute domains are related to each other. We are interested in refining the available knowledge in R using a number of generic meta-principles. To this end, we will make use of background knowledge about the conceptual relationship of different formulas, which we assume to be encoded in a set of assertions Σ (to be formalized in Section 6). We are then interested in defining a consequence relation ⊢ that extends the entailment relation {a mathematical formula}⊨A (i.e. supraclassicality). Specifically, we assume that the following inference rule is valid:{a mathematical formula}The first meta-principle we consider is that intermediate conditions should lead to intermediate conclusions.

       For instance, given that both large and small detached houses have a comfort level that is between basic and luxurious, we derive that also medium detached houses should have a comfort level between these bounds. More generally, if a propositional formula β is conceptually between the formulas {a mathematical formula}β1 and {a mathematical formula}β2, the idea of interpolative inference is that whatever we can derive from β should be conceptually between what we can derive from {a mathematical formula}β1 and what we can derive from {a mathematical formula}β2. The exact nature of this conceptual betweenness will be formalized in the following sections, but intuitively β is conceptually between {a mathematical formula}β1 and {a mathematical formula}β2 if β has all the features that {a mathematical formula}β1 and {a mathematical formula}β2 have in common. We could say, for instance, that a bistro is conceptually between a bar and a restaurant, or that a studio is conceptually between a bedsit and an apartment. In ecology, we may consider that taiga is between tundra and temperate-forest. We could take the view that the painting style of Renoir is conceptually between the painting styles of Monet and Manet.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To encode information about betweenness at the syntactic level, we use a modality ⋈, i.e. the formula {a mathematical formula}β1⋈β2 is true whenever a situation holds which is conceptually between a situation satisfying {a mathematical formula}β1 and a situation satisfying {a mathematical formula}β2 (or alternatively, when talking about concepts, {a mathematical formula}β1⋈β2 is true for instances that are between {a mathematical formula}β1 and {a mathematical formula}β2). Typically, it will not be possible to have a precise definition of {a mathematical formula}β1⋈β2, as, in fact, our logical language may not be rich enough to precisely capture exactly those situations. However, in practice, we may obtain knowledge about upper and lower approximations of {a mathematical formula}β1⋈β2. We write {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ→β1⋈β2 to denote that everything which satisfies γ is conceptually between {a mathematical formula}β1 and {a mathematical formula}β2, and {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β1⋈β2→γ to denote that anything which is conceptually between {a mathematical formula}β1 and {a mathematical formula}β2 should definitely satisfy γ.

      <paragraph label="Example 3">
       It is not the case that all lofts are conceptually between a three-bedroom apartment and a penthouse (e.g. a small loft with only one bedroom), so {a mathematical formula}loft→three-bed-ap⋈penthouse does not hold. However, we do have trivially that{a mathematical formula} Conversely, however, some lofts are between a three-bedroom apartment and a penthouse, so we cannot remove the disjunct loft in the consequent of the following implication{a mathematical formula} Note that in the considered domain, there are no apartments with more than three bedrooms (with the possible exception of penthouses), hence {a mathematical formula}three-bed-ap, loft and penthouse exhaustively cover all situations that are between a three-bedroom apartment and a penthouse.On the other hand, we may consider that all studios are between bedsits and one-bedroom apartments. Under this view, we should be able to derive the following rules from Σ:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Using the binary modality ⋈, we can define the following interpolative inference rule:{a mathematical formula} A diagrammatic representation of this interpolation principle is shown in Fig. 1(a): given two rules {a mathematical formula}β1→γ1 and {a mathematical formula}β2→γ2, we derive a rule which applies to a situation {a mathematical formula}β⁎ which is intermediate between {a mathematical formula}β1 and {a mathematical formula}β2. The conclusion {a mathematical formula}γ⁎ of that rule is required to exhaustively cover all situations that are intermediate between {a mathematical formula}γ1 and {a mathematical formula}γ2.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The second meta-principle states that analogous changes in the condition of a rule should lead to analogous changes in the conclusion.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Let us write {a mathematical formula}〈β1,β2〉 to denote the change that is needed to convert a specification compatible with {a mathematical formula}β1 into a specification compatible with {a mathematical formula}β2. The intuition will be that {a mathematical formula}〈β1,β2〉 determines a direction-of-change. In contrast to betweenness, this notion of direction is not symmetric, e.g. while {a mathematical formula}〈two-bed-ap,three-bed-ap〉 denotes the direction of an increasing number of bedrooms, {a mathematical formula}〈three-bed-ap,two-bed-ap〉 denotes a decreasing number. Given a third formula {a mathematical formula}β3, we are then interested in those situations that can be obtained by changing a situation compatible with {a mathematical formula}β3 in the direction specified by {a mathematical formula}〈β1,β2〉. In particular, we will write {a mathematical formula}β3▷〈β1,β2〉 for the formula that covers all such situations. For example, we could consider that progressive rock differs from hard rock by having less standard song structures and arrangements, while keeping the same instruments. Then {a mathematical formula}heavy-metal▷〈hard-rock,prog-rock〉 would cover all music genres that use heavy metal instruments and timbres, but less standard song structures and arrangements. This would include all progressive metal, as well as some instances of avant-garde metal, among others. In biology, we may consider that the difference between dog to coyote is analogous to the difference between cat and leopard, or to the difference between cat and lynx, which we could encode as {a mathematical formula}coyote→dog▷〈cat,leopard〉 and {a mathematical formula}coyote→dog▷〈cat,lynx〉 respectively. Note in particular that we do not take into account the amount of change: while we may consider that the change from cat to leopard is bigger than the change from dog to coyote, the direction of change is the same.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       As for betweenness, we will mainly be interested in approximating {a mathematical formula}β3▷〈β1,β2〉 rather than finding an exact definition, i.e. we will be looking for propositional formulas that imply, and that are implied by {a mathematical formula}β3▷〈β1,β2〉.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 4">
       The change from a bedsit to a studio essentially corresponds to an increase in size and comfort. In this sense, such a change is similar to the change from a two-bedroom apartment to a three-bedroom apartment, or even to a penthouse. We may consider, for instance:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Only the direction of the change is taken into account here, and not the amount of change. For instance, we might have{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Note that the meaning of {a mathematical formula}〈.,.〉 by itself cannot be expressed at the syntactic level, i.e. {a mathematical formula}.▷〈.,.〉 is treated as a ternary modality. Extrapolative inference can then be formalized as follows:{a mathematical formula} A diagrammatic representation is given in Fig. 1(b). In this case, three rules {a mathematical formula}β1→γ1, {a mathematical formula}β2→γ2 and {a mathematical formula}β3→γ3 are available, and we are interested in deriving conclusions about a fourth situation {a mathematical formula}β⁎ which differs from {a mathematical formula}β1 as {a mathematical formula}β3 differs from {a mathematical formula}β2. The conclusion {a mathematical formula}γ⁎ which is derived exhaustively covers all situations that differ from {a mathematical formula}γ1 as {a mathematical formula}γ3 differs from {a mathematical formula}γ2.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Finally, we assume that the consequence relation ⊢ is deductively closed:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 5">
       Consider the rules from Example 2. Applying (S), we immediately have{a mathematical formula} Assuming{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} we find using (I) that{a mathematical formula} and using (D) that {a mathematical formula}(R,Σ)⊢villa→medium∨large∨very-large which refines the trivial conclusion that we obtained in Example 2. Similarly, we find using (S) that{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} If we now assume that (writing det for detached){a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} then (E) yields{a mathematical formula} from which we obtain using (D) that {a mathematical formula}(R,Σ)⊢medium∧row-house→bas∨comf. Indeed, the rule in (11) plays the role of {a mathematical formula}β1→γ1 from the definition of (D), whereas the rule {a mathematical formula}β2→γ2 is trivial.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       At this point it may not be clear whether the inference relation defined by (S), (I), (E) and (D) always behaves according to intuition, nor what the implications are at the semantic level of adopting (I) and (E). To this end, in the following sections, we will develop a semantic counterpart of the inference relation ⊢, which will clarify the nature of the modalities ⋈ and {a mathematical formula}▷〈,〉 and will allow us to implement decision procedures for reasoning tasks of interest. A crucial issue that will be discussed in detail is the interaction between the aforementioned modalities on the one hand, and logical conjunction on the other hand, e.g. discussing under which conditions {a mathematical formula}(α1∧β1)⋈(α2∧β2) is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}(α1⋈α2)∧(β1⋈β2).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The principles (I) and (E) allow us to refine a rule base R by exploiting background knowledge about the conceptual relationship of labels from the same attribute domain. This background knowledge is of a qualitative nature. Extrapolative reasoning, for instance, is based on the idea of direction of change, but does not take the amount of change into account. An analogical proportion such as {a mathematical formula}a:b::c:d, on the other hand, not only expresses that the change from a to b goes in the same direction as the change from c to d, but also that the amount of change between a and b is the same as the amount of change between c and d[40]. To take information about the amount of change into account, and thus generalize analogical reasoning — making it also more cautious when necessary — we will use expressions such as {a mathematical formula}β1▷[λ,μ]〈β2,β3〉 where {a mathematical formula}0⩽λ⩽μ&lt;+∞. Intuitively, this formula covers all situations that can be obtained by changing {a mathematical formula}β1 in the same direction as the change from {a mathematical formula}β2 to {a mathematical formula}β3, such that the amount of change is between λ and μ times as large as the amount of change between {a mathematical formula}β2 and {a mathematical formula}β3. This allows us to make inferences which are more precise in cases where suitable information about the amount of change is available. For example, knowing that the amount of change between dog and coyote is approximately the same as the amount of change between cat and lynx, the latter relationship is more useful than the relationship between cat and leopard if we want to derive knowledge about coyotes from knowledge about dogs.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The most straightforward use of this generalization is to express whether the amount of change from {a mathematical formula}β1 should be smaller, equal, or larger than the amount of change from {a mathematical formula}β2 to {a mathematical formula}β3. In particular, {a mathematical formula}β1▷[1,1]〈β2,β3〉 corresponds to the solution X that makes {a mathematical formula}β1:X::β2:β3 a perfect analogical proportion, while {a mathematical formula}β1▷[0,1[〈β2,β3〉 and {a mathematical formula}β1▷]1,+∞[〈β2,β3〉 express amounts of change that are smaller and larger, respectively, than the amount of change from {a mathematical formula}β2 to {a mathematical formula}β3. Note that {a mathematical formula}β1▷[0,+∞[〈β2,β3〉 corresponds to {a mathematical formula}β1▷〈β2,β3〉. Also note that in the aforementioned cases, the approach remains entirely qualitative. Other choices for the intervals {a mathematical formula}[λ,μ] may give the approach a more numerical flavour, and would mainly be useful in scenarios where the conceptual relationships are obtained using data-driven techniques.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For τ a non-empty subset of {a mathematical formula}[0,+∞[, Principle (E) can be refined to{a mathematical formula} Along similar lines, for σ a non-empty subset of {a mathematical formula}[0,1], we consider expressions of the form {a mathematical formula}β1⋈σβ2 to put constraints on the relative closeness to {a mathematical formula}β1 and {a mathematical formula}β2. Specifically, {a mathematical formula}β1⋈[0,0.5[β2 corresponds to those situations between {a mathematical formula}β1 and {a mathematical formula}β2 that are closer to {a mathematical formula}β1 than to {a mathematical formula}β2. Note that {a mathematical formula}β1⋈[0,0.5[β2 is a refinement of the construct {a mathematical formula}β1⇇β2 from CSL [29], as betweenness is not required in CSL, only comparative closeness. Similarly, {a mathematical formula}β1⋈]0.5,1]β2 corresponds to situations that are closer to {a mathematical formula}β2 than to {a mathematical formula}β1, and {a mathematical formula}β1⋈[0.5,0.5]β2 to situations that are exactly halfway. When data-driven techniques are used, other intervals may again be useful. In scenarios where labels can be assumed to be equidistant, we may also know e.g. that {a mathematical formula}small→very-small⋈[0.25,0.25]very-large and {a mathematical formula}large→very-small⋈[0.75,0.75]very-large, where the idea is that medium is halfway between very-small and very-large and small is halfway between very-small and medium.

       Mappings between attribute domains
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       At the semantic level, a rule base R can be seen as a mapping between sets of vectors of attributes. In particular, assume that all the labels in the antecedents of the rules in R belong to the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}B1,…,Bs and that the labels in the consequents belong to {a mathematical formula}C1,…,Ck. The rule base R can then equivalently be expressed as a function {a mathematical formula}fR from subsets of {a mathematical formula}B=B1×⋯×Bs to subsets of {a mathematical formula}C=C1×⋯×Ck, defined for {a mathematical formula}X⊆B as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}A=A1×⋯×An and {a mathematical formula}{A1,…,An}={B1,…,Bs}∪{C1,…,Ck} as before. It is not hard to see that this function indeed expresses the same knowledge as the rule base R. Furthermore, there exists a single {a mathematical formula}Y⁎∈2C such that {a mathematical formula}fR(X)=Y⁎ and{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 7">
       Consider again the rules base from Example 2. We have that {a mathematical formula}B=A1×A2×A3, as no rule refers to comfort levels in its antecedent, and {a mathematical formula}C=A2×A3×A4, as only the coarser housing types of {a mathematical formula}A2 are referred to in the consequent of rules. We find that a small detached villa is either basic or comfortable:{a mathematical formula} Indeed, from{a mathematical formula} It follows that{a mathematical formula} from which we can already conclude{a mathematical formula} It is furthermore clear that there are no rules in R which could be used to further refine {a mathematical formula}fR({(villa,det,small)}).Similarly, we find that a bungalow is detached and medium-sized, while we find no restrictions on the possible comfort levels:{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       We may see {a mathematical formula}fR as an approximate (i.e. incomplete) model of a given domain, which may be refined as soon as new information becomes available. In particular, for two {a mathematical formula}2B→2C functions f and {a mathematical formula}f′ which are monotone w.r.t. set inclusion, we say that f is a refinement of {a mathematical formula}f′, written {a mathematical formula}f⩽f′, iff{a mathematical formula} This idea of using monotone set-valued functions to describe approximate models is closely linked to the theory of Scott domains; see e.g. [41] for an elaboration of this idea. At the semantic level, completing the rule base R boils down to refining the corresponding function {a mathematical formula}fR. In our approach, such refinements will be based on meta-knowledge about the nature of the relationship between {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C. This will lead us to replace {a mathematical formula}fR by the largest refinement, w.r.t. ⩽, which is compatible with the imposed meta-knowledge. In particular, as will become clear below, Principles (I) and (E) amount to refine {a mathematical formula}fR by imposing some form of monotonicity, whereas (Iʼ) and (Eʼ) amount to refine {a mathematical formula}fR by imposing a form of linearity. As could be expected, the meta-knowledge underlying (Iʼ) and (Eʼ) is stronger than the meta-knowledge underlying (I) and (E).

      Formalization using conceptual spaces
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      The approach sketched in Section 3 requires information about how the labels of an attribute domain are conceptually related to each other. Provided that this information is available, inference can be carried out purely at the symbolic level. However, to justify the inference procedure, and to provide an adequate semantics for it, we need to be precise on how relationships such as betweenness should be interpreted. To this end, we assume that the cognitive meaning of the attributes can be represented geometrically, as convex regions in a conceptual space. Conceptual relationships can then be given a clear spatial interpretation, as will be discussed in Section 4.1. Taking advantage of this link with conceptual spaces, Section 4.2 subsequently reviews some opportunities for the acquisition of conceptual relations. Finally, Section 4.3 presents the idea of regular mappings between conceptual spaces as a basis for interpolative and extrapolative reasoning.

       Geometric modelling of attribute domains
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The theory of conceptual spaces [13] is centred around the assumption that the meaning of a natural property can be adequately modelled as a convex region in some geometric space. Formally, a conceptual space is the Cartesian product {a mathematical formula}Q1×⋯×Qm of quality dimensions, each of which corresponds to an atomic, cognitively meaningful feature, called a quality. A standard example is the conceptual space of colours, which can be described using the quality dimensions hue, saturation and intensity. Labels to describe colours, in some natural language, are then posited to correspond to convex regions in this conceptual space, a view which is closely related to the ideas of prototype theory [42]. The label red for instance will be represented by the set of points whose hue is in the spectrum normally associated with red, whose saturation is sufficiently high, and whose intensity is neither too high nor too low. Note that while e.g. red may be an atomic property at the symbolic level, at the cognitive level it is defined in terms of more primitive notions. Quality dimensions may be continuous or discrete, and can even be finite. In practice, however, it is common to identify conceptual spaces with Euclidean spaces [42], and to define cognitive similarity in terms of Euclidean distance. We will also adopt this simplifying view throughout the paper, although part of the discussion readily generalizes to more general spaces.{sup:2}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Now consider again the example of housing types. A conceptual space to represent housing types would have a large number of dimensions, relating to shape, size, colour, texture, etc. Each house that exists in the world will correspond to one specific point in this conceptual space. Conversely, however, there may be points in that conceptual space which do not correspond to structures that can be physically realized, or that would not be recognized as houses (e.g. a building structure of 20 km long and 1 cm wide). Each attribute from the domain {a mathematical formula}A1 corresponds to a convex region in the conceptual space, where intuitively, e.g. the region corresponding to villa corresponds to those building structures that are more similar to prototypical villas than to prototypical instances of the other attributes in {a mathematical formula}A1.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In general, each attribute domain {a mathematical formula}Ai thus corresponds to a partition of some conceptual space in convex regions, where each attribute of {a mathematical formula}Ai corresponds to a partition class. As some regions of conceptual spaces may correspond to types of instances that do not exist in the real world, the number of partition classes may, in principle be higher than the number of attributes in {a mathematical formula}Ai. We write {a mathematical formula}reg(x) to denote the convex region that corresponds to label x. For example, {a mathematical formula}reg(three-bed-ap) represents all sections of building structures that could be classified as three-bedroom apartments. This set will contain both points that correspond to actual apartments (which exist somewhere in the world) and possible apartments (which may in principle be built one day).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       This conceptual space representation of the attributes is considerably richer than what can be described at the symbolic level, and therefore also allows for richer forms of inference. However, in most application domains, it is not reasonable to assume that such representations are available. Moreover, the precise representation of a property in a conceptual space strongly depends on the considered context and may be subjective. Usually, however, it is assumed that a particular conceptual space representation can be obtained from a generic representation by appropriately rescaling the quality dimensions [44]. Note that this observation implies that also similarity judgements may differ across contexts and people, as rescaling the dimensions may influence the relative Euclidean distance between points. For instance, while apples are usually considered to be closer to tomatoes than to chocolate, in the context of desserts, they may be closer to chocolate (e.g. because both can be used in cakes). To alleviate these issues, we will rely on (mainly) qualitative knowledge about the spatial relationship of different properties. Such qualitative knowledge may be easier to obtain, and because the spatial relations that will be considered are invariant under affine transformations (such as rescaling the quality dimensions), they are more robust against changes in context and person. In particular, such relations are not affected by rescaling of the quality dimensions, although they would still depend on context changes that introduce additional quality dimensions.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For each attribute domain {a mathematical formula}Ai, we assume that information is available about betweenness and parallelism of the conceptual space representation of its attributes. For example, we may intuitively think of a studio to be between a bedsit and a one-bedroom apartment. In the domain of music genres, we may consider that the change from hard-rock to progressive-rock is parallel to the change from heavy-metal to progressive-metal, and that progressive-rock is between hard-rock and avant-garde. The notions of betweenness and parallelism are straightforwardly defined for points in Euclidean spaces. In particular, let us write {a mathematical formula}bet(p,q,r) to denote that q lies between p and r (on the same line), and {a mathematical formula}par(p,q,r,s) to denote that the vectors {a mathematical formula}pq→ and {a mathematical formula}rs→ point in the same direction. The fact that point q is between points p and r means that for every point x it holds that {a mathematical formula}d(q,x)⩽max(d(p,x),d(r,x)), and in particular, that whenever p and r are close to a prototype of some concept, then q is close to it as well. In this sense, we may see {a mathematical formula}bet(p,q,r) as a way to express that whatever natural properties p and r have in common, p and q have them in common as well (identifying points in a conceptual space with instances). On the other hand, {a mathematical formula}par(p,q,r,s) intuitively means that to arrive at s, r needs to be changed in the same way as p needs to be changed to arrive at q, i.e. at the qualitative level, p is to q as r is to s (although the amount of change may be different).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The notions of betweenness and parallelism, which are defined for points, need to be extended to regions, in order to describe relationships between attributes. As is well known, this can be done in different ways [45]. We will consider the following two notions of betweenness for regions A, B, and C (in a given Euclidean space):{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} In particular, if A and C are convex regions, {a mathematical formula}bet¯(A,B,C) holds if B overlaps with the convex hull of {a mathematical formula}A∪C, whereas {a mathematical formula}bet̲(A,B,C) holds if B is included in this convex hull. These two notions of betweenness are illustrated in Fig. 2(a), where {a mathematical formula}bet̲(A,B1,C), {a mathematical formula}bet¯(A,B1,C) and {a mathematical formula}bet¯(A,B2,C) hold, but not {a mathematical formula}bet̲(A,B2,C). Note in particular that both relations are reflexive w.r.t. the first two arguments, in the sense that e.g. {a mathematical formula}bet¯(A,A,C) holds, as well as symmetric, in the sense that e.g. {a mathematical formula}bet¯(A,B,C)≡bet¯(C,B,A). However, transitivity does not necessarily hold for regions, e.g. from {a mathematical formula}bet̲(A,B,C) and {a mathematical formula}bet̲(B,C,D) we cannot infer that {a mathematical formula}bet̲(A,B,D); a counterexample is depicted in Fig. 3(a).{sup:3} In the terminology of rough set theory [46], {a mathematical formula}bet¯ and {a mathematical formula}bet̲ correspond to upper and lower approximations of betweenness. The underlying idea is that, given our finite set of labels, we may not be able to exactly describe the convex hull of two regions A and B. All we can do, then, is to list all labels which are completely included in the convex hull (i.e. define the lower approximation of the convex hull), and all labels which have a non-empty intersection with the convex hull (i.e. define the upper approximation of the convex hull). In the following, for the ease of presentation we will often identify labels with the corresponding regions, writing e.g. {a mathematical formula}bet̲(a,b,c) for {a mathematical formula}bet̲(reg(a),reg(b),reg(c)).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 8">
       In the domain of housing types, we may consider that we have {a mathematical formula}bet¯(three-bed-ap,loft,penthouse) but not {a mathematical formula}bet̲(three-bed-ap,loft,penthouse). Note that this corresponds to what was expressed at the syntactic level in Example 3.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For regions A, B, C and D (in a given Euclidean space), two notions of parallelism will be considered:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} For parallelism, the role of the convex hull is replaced by a notion of conical extension, which is illustrated in Fig. 2(b). In particular, if {a mathematical formula}par¯(A,B,C;D) holds, some point in D differs from some point in C in the same direction that some point in B differs from some point in A. In the scenario of Fig. 2(b), this means that D overlaps with the shaded area. Likewise, when {a mathematical formula}par̲(A,B,C;D) holds, D is included in the shaded area of Fig. 2(b). For all regions A, B and C, we have that {a mathematical formula}par̲(A,B,C;C) holds (and thus also {a mathematical formula}par¯(A,B,C;C)), as well as {a mathematical formula}par̲(A,B,A;B). However, as for betweenness, transitivity does not hold, as is illustrated in Fig. 3(b).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 9">
       We may consider that the following relations hold (cf. Example 4){a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} In other words, for every point s in {a mathematical formula}reg(three-bed) we can find points {a mathematical formula}p∈reg(bedsit), {a mathematical formula}q∈reg(studio) and {a mathematical formula}r∈reg(two-bed-ap) such that {a mathematical formula}pq→ is parallel to {a mathematical formula}rs→. In other words, every three-bedroom apartment differs from some two-bedroom apartment in (qualitatively) the same way as some studio differs from some bedsit. Similarly, we have that some (but not all) lofts differ from some two-bedroom apartment in the same way that some studio differs from some bedsit.

       As a refinement of {a mathematical formula}bet(p,q,r), we may put constraints on the distance ratio {a mathematical formula}d(p,q)d(p,r), where d denotes the Euclidean distance. Note that distance ratios for points on the same line are preserved under affine transformations. In particular, for σ a subset of {a mathematical formula}[0,1], we consider the following relations:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Clearly, {a mathematical formula}bet¯=bet[0,1]¯ and {a mathematical formula}bet̲=bet[0,1]̲. Other notable cases are {a mathematical formula}σ=[0.5,0.5], when (17), (18) express that B is halfway between A and C, {a mathematical formula}σ=]0.5,1], when (17), (18) express that B is closer to C than to A, and {a mathematical formula}σ=[0,0.5[, when (17), (18) express that B is closer to A than to C. Note that we can only have {a mathematical formula}bet̲[0,0](reg(a),reg(b),reg(c)) if {a mathematical formula}a=b since labels from the same attribute domain are assumed to be disjoint. A similar refinement of parallelism is possible, where for τ a subset of {a mathematical formula}[0,+∞[, we define{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} In the particular case where {a mathematical formula}τ=[1,1], (19)–(20) extend the idea of a parallelogram, whose relationship to the idea of analogical proportion is well known.

       Acquiring conceptual relations
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Regarding the applicability of our approach, an important question is how the required relational knowledge about conceptual spaces can be obtained, e.g. how do we find out that a studio is conceptually between a bedsit and a one-bedroom apartment? Depending on the specific application, different options may be available.

        Manual encoding
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        In some domains, it is feasible to manually encode a complete qualitative description of a conceptual space. Most notably, this is the case for conceptual spaces that are uni-dimensional, for which it suffices to provide a ranking of the labels of interest. For instance, a conceptual space of housing sizes may be described by encoding that{a mathematical formula} From this description, we immediately obtain that, for example, the relations {a mathematical formula}bet̲(very-small,medium,large) and {a mathematical formula}par̲(very-small,small,medium;very-large) hold. Note that in uni-dimensional domains, the relations {a mathematical formula}bet̲ and {a mathematical formula}bet¯ coincide when applied to labels of the same attribute domain (as these correspond to disjoint intervals), as do the relations {a mathematical formula}par̲ and {a mathematical formula}par¯. In multi-dimensional domains, it may still be the case that providing a qualitative description is mainly a matter of ranking. The qualitative description of such simple multi-dimensional conceptual spaces can easily be modelled using a diagram. Fig. 4 provides an example of such a diagram, where lines define tuples that satisfy {a mathematical formula}bet̲ and parallel lines define tuples that satisfy {a mathematical formula}par̲. For example, in the case of Fig. 4, we have that{a mathematical formula} As the formalization of such diagrams is straightforward, we will not discuss it in detail. However, it should be clear that a diagrammatic representation can only be obtained when some simplifying conditions are met. For example, in Fig. 4, it is tacitly assumed that {a mathematical formula}bet̲=bet¯ and {a mathematical formula}par̲=par¯, and moreover that many transitivity and mixed transitivity properties are assumed for {a mathematical formula}bet̲ and {a mathematical formula}par̲ that do not hold in general (e.g. {a mathematical formula}bet̲(a,b,c)∧par̲(b,c,d;e)⇒par̲(a,c,d;e)). While such diagrams can therefore not account for the full generality offered by the relations {a mathematical formula}bet̲, {a mathematical formula}bet¯, {a mathematical formula}par̲ and {a mathematical formula}par¯, in simple domains, as the housing example of Fig. 4, they offer a convenient way of modelling our intuitions about the conceptual relationships that hold.

        Natural language processing
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        A second possibility is to extract conceptual relations from natural language. In [47], for instance, the idea of latent relational analysis was introduced, with the aim of identifying analogical proportions. As instances of {a mathematical formula}par[1,1]̲ correspond to analogical proportions, conceptual relations of this particular type can be obtained in the same way. The main idea is that two pairs of words are likely to be related analogously, i.e. form an analogical proportion, when the lexical contexts in which they co-occur are similar. For example, the words kitten and cat are found in sentences such as “a kitten is a young cat”, while the words chick and chicken are found in sentences such as “a chick is a young chicken”. From such observations, the analogical proportion {a mathematical formula}kitten:cat::chick:chicken can be discovered. Another technique for discovering analogical proportions from the web was proposed in [48], estimating the strength of analogical proportions by converting co-occurrence statistics using Kolmogorov information theory. Instances of {a mathematical formula}bet[0.5,0.5]̲(a,b,c) could be identified with analogical proportions of the form {a mathematical formula}a:b::b:c. In principle, instances of {a mathematical formula}bet̲ and {a mathematical formula}bet¯ can be discovered by applying general methods for extracting ternary relations from text [49]. However, it is clear that the use of information extraction techniques to define the relations {a mathematical formula}bet̲, {a mathematical formula}bet¯, {a mathematical formula}par̲ and {a mathematical formula}par¯ will necessarily by highly heuristic, due to the inherent imperfection of such methods.

        Data-driven techniques
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        If sufficient information is available about instances of concepts or properties, several data-driven approaches can be used, which directly take advantage of the geometric nature of the relations of interest. For instance, [42] suggests to start from pairwise similarity judgements between instances, and use multi-dimensional scaling to obtain coordinates for them in a Euclidean space. Representations of concepts can then be obtained by determining the corresponding Voronoi tessellation, after which the conceptual relations of interest can be evaluated by straightforward geometric calculations. The number of dimensions of the resulting space can be freely chosen, where fewer dimensions lead to more conceptual relationships, as only the most prominent dimensions of the conceptual space are then taken into account. Thus, the lower the number of dimensions, the less cautious the resulting inference mechanism will be. In [50], the feasibility of such an approach was demonstrated in the domain of music genres, using similarity judgements that were obtained indirectly using user-contributed meta-data from the website last.fm.{sup:4}
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Rather than starting from similarity judgements, [14] suggests an approach based on singular value decomposition (SVD), which is a form of dimensionality reduction. Translated to our setting, the approach would start from a matrix where rows correspond to instances and columns correspond to binary features that these instances may or may not have. Instances are then represented in a high-dimensional space with one dimension for each feature, and coordinates are either 0 or 1, depending on whether the instance has the corresponding feature. Using SVD, a linear transformation is then determined which maps this high-dimensional space onto a space of lower dimension, with real-valued coordinates. As before, the resulting representations of the instance can be used to generate geometric representations of the concepts. Again we have that the chosen number of dimensions determines to what extent all quality dimensions, or only the most prominent ones are taken into account. Note that this latter approach offers an interesting connection between representations of concepts as sets of features and geometric representations, which also allows us to make the relationship between analogical proportions and parallelism explicit. In particular, assume that the analogical proportion {a mathematical formula}a:b::c:d holds for the instances a, b, c and d, and let their sets of features be denoted by A, B, C and D respectively. According to the formal definition of analogical proportion [40], [32], we have that {a mathematical formula}A∖B=C∖D and {a mathematical formula}B∖A=D∖C (where we write ∖ for set difference). From this observation, it is easy to see that the representations of a, b, c and d form a parallelogram in the initial, high-dimensional {a mathematical formula}{0,1}-valued space. Since, parallelograms are preserved under linear transformations, a, b, c and d will still form a parallelogram in the resulting conceptual spaces representation. Note that in principle, due to the lower number of dimensions, the conceptual space may contain more quadruples of instances that form a parallelogram than the initial space. These parallelograms intuitively correspond to pairs of instances that are analogical in all relevant aspects.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Alternatively, the SVD approach can also be applied when feature representations of concepts, rather than instances, are available. The concepts are then represented as points, and betweenness and parallelism of these points may be taken to be indicative of betweenness and parallelism of the unknown representations of the concepts as regions.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph label="Example 10">
        Consider a rule base about red wines. From a web page about red wines{sup:5} we learn the following knowledge{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Given the large number of wine types that exist, inevitably some types are not contained in this rule base. Let us consider, as an example, the wines Barbera and Bandol. From another web page about wine,{sup:6} we extract information about wine–food pairings. For each listed wine type, we create a vector with one component for every listed food type. This component is set to 1 if the wine is mentioned as appropriate for the corresponding food type, and to 0 otherwise. Assuming that wine–food pairings are based on the taste of the wine, they may provide a valuable source of information about how different wines are related to each other. Using the SVD technique, we reduce the dimension of these vectors to a specified (typically somewhat arbitrary) number of abstract dimensions; in this example, we take 5 dimensions. As every wine type is then represented as a point in a 5-dimensional space, we can calculate which wines are between which other ones. In particular, if the cosine of the angle between {a mathematical formula}ab→ and {a mathematical formula}ac→ is sufficiently close to 1, for a, b and c the vector representations of three wine types a, b and c, and if {a mathematical formula}‖ab→‖&lt;‖ac→‖, we assume that the taste of wine b is between that of wines a and c. Similarly, if the cosine of the angle between {a mathematical formula}ab→ and {a mathematical formula}cd→ is sufficiently close to 1, we assume that the change from wine a to wine b goes in the same direction as the change from wine c to wine d. In this way, we obtained that Barbera is between Chianti and Merlot (requiring the cosine to be at least 0.975). Given that these latter two wines, have either low or medium tannins, we can derive using interpolative inference that the same should hold for Barbera. Bandol, on the other hand, is not found to be between any two other types of wine. However, we do find that the following pairs {a mathematical formula}〈(a,b),(c,d)〉 correspond to parallel changes in wine type (again requiring the cosine to be at least 0.975):{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Given that the change from both Barolo and Bordeaux to Barbera is towards lower tannins, using extrapolative reasoning we derive that the amount of tannins in Bandol should not be smaller than the amount found in Zinfandel, i.e. we find that Bandol either has medium or high tannins.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        Note that these data-driven approaches essentially use quantitative information to obtain a qualitative representation. One reason for not using a purely quantitative approach is that the available data is not likely to be sufficiently informative to build accurate conceptual space representations, but still allows us to discover information about qualitative relations between regions. In the case of Example 10, for instance, the quantitative representation we start with represents each concept as a point rather than a convex region. A second reason is that geometric calculations, such as determining convex hulls or Voronoi tessellations, are computationally expensive in high-dimensional spaces. When all we are interested in are spatial relations such as betweenness and parallelism, we can avoid to actually build the conceptual space, using a linear programming approach that was proposed in [50]. Finally, as mentioned before, qualitative representations are invariant w.r.t. changes in the relative importance of the different quality dimensions.

       Regular mappings between conceptual spaces
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       In this section, we show how the idea of interpolation and extrapolation can be formalized, and explicate the assumptions that warrant such forms of inference. We start from the functional view on rule bases suggested in Section 3.2. In particular, given the view of attribute domains as granular descriptions of conceptual spaces, we may look at mappings between attribute domains as granular descriptions of mappings between conceptual spaces. Let {a mathematical formula}A=A1×⋯×An, {a mathematical formula}B=B1×⋯×Bs and {a mathematical formula}C=C1×⋯×Ck be defined as before. As each {a mathematical formula}Ai, {a mathematical formula}Bj and {a mathematical formula}Cl correspond to a conceptual space, also {a mathematical formula}A, {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C correspond to conceptual spaces, which we will denote by {a mathematical formula}A, {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C respectively. Note that the set of quality dimensions underlying {a mathematical formula}A is the union of the quality dimensions underlying the conceptual space representations of {a mathematical formula}A1,…,An and similar for {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The mapping {a mathematical formula}fR, induced by the knowledge base R, can then be seen as a mapping from subsets of {a mathematical formula}B to subsets of {a mathematical formula}C. The nature of this mapping will strongly depend on the nature of the rules involved. For example, let us consider the following rules{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} In these rules, the consequent is implied (only) by the meaning of the terms that appear in the antecedent, e.g. a museum which has live animals is called a zoo, by definition of the word zoo. As a result, we can make the assumption that the quality dimensions in {a mathematical formula}C form a subset of the quality dimensions in {a mathematical formula}B. This in turn means that there is a linear mapping m (viz. a projection) from {a mathematical formula}B to the lower-dimensional space {a mathematical formula}C. The (known) mapping {a mathematical formula}fR can then be seen as an approximation of the (unknown) mapping m. Note that this means that there is an underlying functional dependency, e.g. every housing option will have a specific size, and every wine will have a specific degree of transparency. We will refer to rules of this kind as categorization rules.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Categorization rules can be contrasted with phenomenological rules, which encode observations about the world, e.g.:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} While in the four previous rules, the conclusion is the consequence of a categorical definition, in case of phenomenological rules, there is usually no underlying functional dependency: knowing the time of the day does not allow us to precisely know the amount of traffic, while knowing the date and location does not allow us to precisely know the amount of rain. Interestingly, a similar link between commonsense reasoning and functional dependencies was already pointed out in [51].
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The method we propose in this paper is based on the assumption that a rule base approximates a linear mapping, and thus only applies to categorization rules. However, it is worth noting that even for phenomenological rules, our method can often produce plausible conclusions when it is applied locally, e.g. while we should not conclude that there is heavy traffic at mid-day from the observations that there is heavy traffic in the morning and in the evening, it makes sense to conclude that there is heavy-traffic mid-morning if we know that there is heavy traffic in the early morning and late morning. Moreover, whether a rule classifies as phenomenological or not may depend on the underlying conceptual space representations that are assumed. For instance, the conceptual space representation of morning may in fact include a quality dimension for the amount of traffic, when mornings (in cities) and rush hour are considered to be so tied together that traffic jams become a characteristic feature of mornings (in a similar way that flying has become a characteristic feature of birds, even if it is not a defining feature). As a result of these considerations, when applying our method in practice, we would by default assume that it contains categorization rules. When this does not introduce any inconsistencies, the conclusions it produces are in some sense the most plausible ones, given the information that it available. When inconsistencies are introduced in the process, however, we may need to partially revise the assumption that the rules are categorization rules and/or that the conceptual relations we have are appropriate in the given context (i.e. take into account all the relevant features). While interpolative and extrapolative reasoning are monotonic forms of reasoning in principle, in practice they would be applied in a non-monotonic fashion, in the sense that adding more rules to a knowledge base may introduce inconsistencies, which would then lead us to apply interpolation and extrapolation more cautiously (or not at all). In Section 8, we will come back to the issue of how to deal with inconsistencies that are introduced by interpolative or extrapolative reasoning.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       By taking the view that {a mathematical formula}fR is the approximation of an unknown mapping m from points of {a mathematical formula}B to points of {a mathematical formula}C, we have for {a mathematical formula}X⊆B that {a mathematical formula}reg(fR(X))⊇{m(p)|p∈reg(X)}, where we write {a mathematical formula}reg(X) for the geometric representation of X as a region in {a mathematical formula}B or {a mathematical formula}C as before. More precisely, we take the view that the rule base R is compatible with some underlying mapping m in the sense that for each {a mathematical formula}X⊆B and {a mathematical formula}Y⊆C it holds that{a mathematical formula} where the {a mathematical formula}2B→2C mapping {a mathematical formula}m⁎ is defined as the point-wise extension of m.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The actual conceptual spaces {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C, and a fortiori the mapping m, are inaccessible in most applications. For instance, we cannot assume that a precise definition of a loft is available, or even an exhaustive enumeration of the qualities on which such a definition would depend. Moreover, using our finite vocabulary, we can only encode approximations of the mapping m, even in the face of complete knowledge. Let us write {a mathematical formula}fˆ for the most informative approximation that can be described using the available labels, i.e. {a mathematical formula}fˆ is the {a mathematical formula}2B→2C mapping defined for {a mathematical formula}X∈2B by{a mathematical formula} In other words, {a mathematical formula}fR corresponds to the knowledge we actually have, while {a mathematical formula}fˆ corresponds to the maximal knowledge about the mapping m that we could hope to obtain.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 11">
       Fig. 5 displays a setting where {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C consist of only one attribute domain, where {a mathematical formula}B=B1={a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i} and {a mathematical formula}C=C1={j,k,l,n,o,u,v,w,x,y,z}. The mapping m maps each point from {a mathematical formula}B to a point of {a mathematical formula}C. The only knowledge that we have about m is in the forms of rules in the rule base R, which act as constraints on the mapping m. Assume, for example, that R contains the rule {a mathematical formula}d→n∨u∨v∨w, and no other information about d. Then we have that {a mathematical formula}fR({d})={n,u,v,w}. This mapping {a mathematical formula}fR is an approximation of the mapping m, for which e.g. {a mathematical formula}m(p)=r and {a mathematical formula}m(q)=s holds. Now suppose that for every point x in {a mathematical formula}reg(d) it holds that {a mathematical formula}m(x)∈reg(n)∪reg(v), i.e. {a mathematical formula}m⁎(reg(d))={m(x)|x∈reg(d)}⊆reg(n)∪reg(v). Then the most precise mapping {a mathematical formula}fˆ that can be described using the vocabulary offered by {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C is such that {a mathematical formula}fˆ({d})={n,v}. This means that the rule {a mathematical formula}d→n∨u∨v∨w could be refined to {a mathematical formula}d→n∨v, but this knowledge is missing from R.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The mapping {a mathematical formula}fˆ is not available to us either; it corresponds to the semantic counterpart of a complete rule base, i.e. a rule base which entails all rules that are compatible with m. All we know about {a mathematical formula}fˆ is that it is a refinement of {a mathematical formula}fR.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 1">
       If R is compatible with m in the sense of(21), it holds that{a mathematical formula}fˆ⩽fR.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Hence the goal of refining the knowledge base R corresponds, at the semantic level, to finding a mapping {a mathematical formula}fRˆ for which it is known that {a mathematical formula}fˆ⩽fRˆ⩽fR. As all our domain knowledge is already encoded in R, a suitable {a mathematical formula}fRˆ≠fR can only be obtained from meta-knowledge about the mapping {a mathematical formula}fˆ, or indirectly, from meta-knowledge about the mapping m. Here our restriction to categorization rules plays a key role, as it suggests that m should satisfy the properties of a linear transformation. This leads to the following postulates about the mapping m ({a mathematical formula}p,q,r,s∈B, {a mathematical formula}λ⩾0):
      </paragraph>
      <list>
       <list-item>
        {a mathematical formula}bet(p,q,r)⇒bet(m(p),m(q),m(r))

       <list-item>
        {a mathematical formula}bet(p,q,r)∧d(p,q)=λ⋅d(r,q)⇒d(m(p),m(q))=λ⋅d(m(r),m(q))

       In the following section, these postulates will be related to the commonsense inference principles that were introduced in Section 3.1. Specifically, it will become clear that the validity of Principle (I) is tied to (bet1), the validity of (E) is tied to (par1), the validity of (Iʼ) is tied to (bet1) and (bet2), and the validity of (Eʼ) is tied to (par1) and (par2).

      Semantic characterization
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      To characterize interpolative and extrapolative inference, it is useful to note that knowledge can be described on three levels, in the given setting. First, there is the syntactic level, where new rules are produced from given sets of rules. This level will form the topic of Section 6. Second, there is the conceptual spaces level, where labels are represented as geometric regions, and knowledge takes the form of relations between geometric representations of properties and concepts, as was described in Section 4. Finally, there is an intermediate level which we will refer to as the semantic level, as it describes knowledge in terms of a standard propositional logic semantics. In particular, as explained in the beginning of Section 3, the elements of {a mathematical formula}A take the role of interpretations of the propositional rules and formulas that we consider. This intermediate, semantic level will form the topic of the present section. In particular, at the semantic level, we are interested in approximating the mapping m between the conceptual spaces {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C, as well as relations such as betweenness and parallelism, using the vocabulary at hand. Typically, for a given conceptual space, a number of attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl will be available, containing labels to refer to designated regions of the conceptual space. For the conceptual spaces {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C, these are respectively the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}B1,…,Bs and {a mathematical formula}C1,…,Ck. In general, the available attribute domains determine the level of granularity with which we can describe the underlying conceptual space.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The considered setting of three levels requires us to take into account some subtleties regarding the notion of logical consistency. A logical formula α was defined to be consistent w.r.t. {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl if there exists an element {a mathematical formula}d∈D1×⋯×Dl that corresponds to a propositional model of that formula. However, in general, we are not guaranteed that d actually corresponds to a non-empty region of the underlying conceptual space {a mathematical formula}D. That is because some of the attribute domains may refer to the same quality dimensions. For example, while {a mathematical formula}blue∧wine may be consistent at the propositional level, it corresponds to an empty set in the underlying conceptual space.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Let us call two attribute domains orthogonal if the sets of quality dimensions to which they refer are disjoint. In other words, two attribute domains are orthogonal if their elements refer to different features of a given domain. In particular, if two attribute domains A and B are orthogonal, for every {a mathematical formula}a∈A and {a mathematical formula}b∈B, {a mathematical formula}a∧b will correspond to a non-empty set in the underlying conceptual space, which can be seen as the Cartesian product of {a mathematical formula}reg(a) and {a mathematical formula}reg(b). In other words, fixing the value of an attribute does not further restrict the possible values of the other attributes. For example, consider the rule {a mathematical formula}large∧detached→lux from Example 2. The attribute domains {a mathematical formula}A2 and {a mathematical formula}A3 (corresponding to large and detached) are orthogonal to each other, but neither is orthogonal to the attribute domain {a mathematical formula}A4 (corresponding to lux). The concept of orthogonality is closely related to the idea of logical independence.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We call a set {a mathematical formula}X⊆D1×⋯×Dl realizable if we are guaranteed that X contains at least one element that corresponds to a non-empty region. If all of the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl are orthogonal, this is simply when {a mathematical formula}X≠∅. In general, it may happen that some attribute domains are not orthogonal, but that these attribute domains are irrelevant w.r.t. X. In particular, we define a set {a mathematical formula}X↓i which essentially contains the elements from X that do not depend on the ith attribute domain:{a mathematical formula} Now we can recursively define the notion of realizability. In particular, we say that X is realizable if (i) all attribute domains underlying X are orthogonal and {a mathematical formula}X≠∅ or (ii) there exists an i such that {a mathematical formula}X↓i is realizable.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In this section, we will first analyse how conceptual relations can be defined between subsets of {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl. In Sections 5.1 and 5.2 we will look at betweenness and parallelism, before also taking comparative distance into account in Section 5.3. Finally, in Section 5.4, we will show how these relations can be used to refine the function {a mathematical formula}fR, using the postulates {a mathematical formula}(bet1), {a mathematical formula}(bet2), {a mathematical formula}(par1) and {a mathematical formula}(par2) that were introduced in Section 4.3. Throughout the section, we will assume that the relations {a mathematical formula}bet¯, {a mathematical formula}bet̲, {a mathematical formula}par¯ and {a mathematical formula}par̲ are completely specified on the level of individual labels.

       Betweenness
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       As explained in Section 4, our approach will start from available qualitative knowledge about the conceptual spaces underlying the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}A1,…,An. For three labels {a mathematical formula}x,y,z∈Ai, we may know for example that y is fully between x and z, i.e. {a mathematical formula}bet̲(reg(x),reg(y),reg(z)) holds, or that y is partially between x and z, i.e. {a mathematical formula}bet¯(reg(x),reg(y),reg(z)) holds. Such betweenness information is sufficient for interpolative reasoning in situations where the antecedent of each rule consists of a single atom, taken from some fixed attribute domain B, and where the consequent of each rule consists of a single atom, taken from some fixed attribute domain C. To handle general rule bases, however, we need to lift the betweenness information we have about labels (i.e. atoms) to betweenness information about complex formulas. At the semantic level this means that we need information about the betweenness of subsets of Cartesian products {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl of attribute domains. Indeed, each element of {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl corresponds to a conjunction of atoms at the syntactic level, hence subsets of {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl correspond to arbitrary formulas. Note that each subset of {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl indeed corresponds to a region in some underlying conceptual space {a mathematical formula}D.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       First we focus on characterizing betweenness for elements of {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl. A central observation is that betweenness for a vector of labels cannot be reduced to betweenness for the labels in the respective components. In particular, notice that when {a mathematical formula}bet̲(a1,b1,c1) and {a mathematical formula}bet̲(a2,b2,c2) hold, we do not necessarily have that {a mathematical formula}(b1,b2) is between {a mathematical formula}(a1,a2) and {a mathematical formula}(c1,c2). Indeed, even for points in a Euclidean space of dimension two or more, betweenness in each dimension does not entail collinearity. Here the intuition of {a mathematical formula}bet¯ and {a mathematical formula}bet̲ as upper and lower approximations of betweenness becomes important. In particular, while betweenness in each component is not sufficient, it is a necessary condition, hence the upper approximation of betweenness can still be defined as:{a mathematical formula} where we write e.g. {a mathematical formula}ai for the ith component of vector a. To extend {a mathematical formula}bet̲ to vectors of labels, first note that when the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl are not orthogonal, we cannot provide any non-trivial guarantees as nothing is between the regions corresponding to a and c when one of these regions is empty. Hence {a mathematical formula}bet̲(a,b,c) is false unless {a mathematical formula}a=b=c. On the other hand, if the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl are all orthogonal, we define:{a mathematical formula} Indeed, in the cases where {a mathematical formula}a=b or {a mathematical formula}b=c, we trivially have that {a mathematical formula}bet̲(a,b,c) holds due to the fact that {a mathematical formula}bet(p,p,q) holds for all points p and q. However, note that even in these trivial cases, we still need to require the orthogonality of the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl. In the case where {a mathematical formula}a=b=c, on the other hand, we do have that {a mathematical formula}bet̲(a,b,c) is trivially satisfied, even if all three regions are empty (as can easily be seen from the definition in (16)). The last disjunct in the right-hand side of (23) covers the general case, where we can only guarantee betweenness for a vector of labels if the vectors coincide in all but one component.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 12">
       The quality dimensions underlying attribute domains {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}A2 from Example 2 clearly overlap. For example, it is not possible for a bungalow to also be an apartment, or for a loft to be a row-house. On the other hand, we may consider that attribute domains {a mathematical formula}A2 and {a mathematical formula}A3 are orthogonal. Note that this orthogonality holds irrespective of whether there actually exist apartments that are very-large. What is important is that nothing in the definition of an apartment prevents it from possibly being very-large. As a result, we can derive e.g. that{a mathematical formula} holds but not e.g.{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Now we move to betweenness of subsets of {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl. In particular, we will define sets {a mathematical formula}bet¯(X1,X2) and {a mathematical formula}bet̲(X1,X2) containing respectively those elements from {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl that are possibly partially between elements of {a mathematical formula}X1 and elements of {a mathematical formula}X2, and those elements that are guaranteed to be completely between elements of {a mathematical formula}X1 and elements of {a mathematical formula}X2. For {a mathematical formula}bet¯ this is straightforward:{a mathematical formula} The following proposition shows that this definition is indeed correct in the sense that it is compatible with the geometric notion of betweenness:
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 2">
       Let{a mathematical formula}X1,{a mathematical formula}X2and Y be subsets of{a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl. We have that{a mathematical formula}
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Note that we are slightly abusing notation here, writing {a mathematical formula}bet¯ both for a predicate which takes three regions as argument (as defined in (15)), and for a set which takes two subsets of {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl as argument (as defined in (24)).
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To define {a mathematical formula}bet̲, the realizability of the arguments {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X2 again comes into play. We define:{a mathematical formula} with{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The set Z intuitively corresponds to the trivial situations of betweenness {a mathematical formula}a=b and {a mathematical formula}b=c in (23). If {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X2 are realizable, this means that all elements from {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X2 should be considered to be between {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X2. If {a mathematical formula}X2 is realizable but not {a mathematical formula}X1, we know that {a mathematical formula}X2 corresponds to a non-empty region in the corresponding conceptual space. The set {a mathematical formula}X1, on the other hand, may or may not correspond to a non-empty region, the lack of realizability merely means that we cannot guarantee that {a mathematical formula}reg(X1)≠∅. In such a case, we cannot guarantee that the elements of {a mathematical formula}X2 are between {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X2 as this depends on whether or not {a mathematical formula}X1 corresponds to an empty region. However, it is not hard to see from (16) that {a mathematical formula}bet̲(reg(X1),reg(X1),reg(X2)) holds regardless of whether {a mathematical formula}reg(X1)=∅. The case where only {a mathematical formula}X1 is realizable is similar. If neither of {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X2 are realizable, betweenness can only be guaranteed for elements in {a mathematical formula}X1∩X2, noting that {a mathematical formula}reg(X1∩X2)=∅ as soon as one of {a mathematical formula}reg(X1)=∅ or {a mathematical formula}reg(X2)=∅ holds.

       The second component in the right-hand side of (25) expresses that b is in {a mathematical formula}bet̲(X1,X2) if it is between some element from {a mathematical formula}X1 and some element from {a mathematical formula}X2. The third component is needed to correctly address the case where some of the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl are not orthogonal (in which case the second component is the empty set). In such a case, we will only find elements that are guaranteed to be between {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X2 if the attribute domains which are not orthogonal to the others are in some sense irrelevant. The following proposition shows the correctness of the definition of {a mathematical formula}bet̲ in (25).

       Parallelism
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       The treatment of parallelism is largely analogous to the treatment of betweenness. If the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl are all orthogonal, the relation {a mathematical formula}par̲ can be defined for elements of {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl as follows:{a mathematical formula} As for betweenness, we find that a component-wise assessment of parallelism is not usually sufficient to provide guarantees on the parallelism of the vectors. The exceptions covered by the definition of {a mathematical formula}par̲ are the trivial case where {a mathematical formula}a=c and {a mathematical formula}b=d, the trivial case where {a mathematical formula}c=d, and the case where the transition from a to b, and from c to d only affects one component. If the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl are not orthogonal, we cannot guarantee anything about the parallelism of elements from {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl, unless in the entirely trivial case where {a mathematical formula}a=b=c=d.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For any Cartesian product {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl of attribute domains, {a mathematical formula}par¯ is defined as{a mathematical formula} To assess parallelism w.r.t. subsets {a mathematical formula}X1, {a mathematical formula}X2 and {a mathematical formula}X3 of {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl, we define:{a mathematical formula} with{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} and for {a mathematical formula}y∈Di and {a mathematical formula}X⊆D1×⋯×Dl we define{a mathematical formula} The set {a mathematical formula}Z2 corresponds to those elements that can be added to {a mathematical formula}par̲(X1,X2,X3) due to the trivial case where {a mathematical formula}a=c∧b=d in (26), whereas {a mathematical formula}Z3 corresponds to the trivial case where {a mathematical formula}c=d. In particular, if {a mathematical formula}X1∩X3 is realizable we know that for every point in {a mathematical formula}X2 we can find a point which belongs to both {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X3, hence {a mathematical formula}(X1∩X3,X2,X1∩X3,X2) trivially defines two parallel directions, hence so does {a mathematical formula}(X1,X2,X3,X2). The definition of {a mathematical formula}Z3 is based on the intuition that {a mathematical formula}(X1,X2,X3,X3) trivially defines two parallel directions, but only if {a mathematical formula}X1, {a mathematical formula}X2 and {a mathematical formula}X3 correspond to non-empty regions. As in the case of the set Z in the definition of {a mathematical formula}bet̲, we need to take realizability into account. The third argument of the union in the right-hand side of (27) expresses the basic case: d is in {a mathematical formula}par̲(X1,X2,X3) if there are elements in {a mathematical formula}X1, {a mathematical formula}X2 and {a mathematical formula}X3 such that the corresponding directions are parallel. The fourth argument allows us to ignore irrelevant attribute domains, similar as in the definition of {a mathematical formula}bet̲ in (25). For parallelism, however, there is another case where situations of parallelism in {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Di−1×Di+1×⋯×Dl may be extended to {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Dl, which is covered by the last argument of the union. The central idea is that when {a mathematical formula}Di is orthogonal to the other attribute domains, we can be more tolerant; note that {a mathematical formula}X2↓i×X3↓i⊆⋃y∈DiX2↓y×X3↓y. Indeed, all that is required is that we can extend vectors a, b, c and d in {a mathematical formula}D1×⋯×Di−1×Di+1×⋯×Dl, by choosing the same value x from {a mathematical formula}Di to extend a and b and the same value y to extend c and d, without there being a requirement for {a mathematical formula}x=y to hold.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       On the other hand, regardless of the realizability of {a mathematical formula}X1, {a mathematical formula}X2 and {a mathematical formula}X3, we always define:{a mathematical formula} The correctness of the proposed definitions is demonstrated by the following propositions.

       The relations {a mathematical formula}betσ̲, {a mathematical formula}betσ¯, {a mathematical formula}parτ̲ and {a mathematical formula}parτ¯ behave in general similar to their counterparts {a mathematical formula}bet̲, {a mathematical formula}bet¯, {a mathematical formula}par̲ and {a mathematical formula}par¯. The main exception is when {a mathematical formula}σ=[λ,λ] or {a mathematical formula}τ=[μ,μ] is a degenerate interval, i.e. a singleton, in which case {a mathematical formula}betσ̲ and {a mathematical formula}parτ̲ hold as soon as these relations hold for each of the components, i.e. we have for each {a mathematical formula}λ∈[0,1] and {a mathematical formula}μ∈[0,+∞[ that{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} provided that the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl are orthogonal; otherwise, we still cannot provide any guarantees on betweenness or parallelism beyond the trivial cases where {a mathematical formula}a=b=c and {a mathematical formula}a=b=c=d respectively. The underlying reason that the definition of {a mathematical formula}betσ̲ becomes more tolerant when σ is a singleton is due to the fact that for points {a mathematical formula}p=(p1,p2,…,pn), {a mathematical formula}q=(q1,q2,…,qn), {a mathematical formula}r=(r1,r2,…,rn) in a Euclidean space, it holds that whenever we have {a mathematical formula}qi=pi+λ(ri−pi) for all i, we also have {a mathematical formula}pq→=λ⋅pr→; and similar for {a mathematical formula}parτ̲.

       If σ and τ are not singletons, {a mathematical formula}betσ̲ and {a mathematical formula}parτ̲ are defined as:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} with{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} and where again we assume that {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl are orthogonal. Note that {a mathematical formula}betσ̲ and {a mathematical formula}parτ̲ are essentially defined as {a mathematical formula}bet̲ and {a mathematical formula}par̲ when σ and τ are not singletons, although some of the trivial cases only hold when they contain 0 or 1.

       From Postulates {a mathematical formula}(bet1), {a mathematical formula}(bet2), {a mathematical formula}(par1) and {a mathematical formula}(par2), we know that for all regions {a mathematical formula}A1,A2,A3 in {a mathematical formula}B, it holds that:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}m⁎ is the point-wise extension of m as before, and ({a mathematical formula}σ⊆[0,1], {a mathematical formula}τ⊆[0,+∞[){a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} In other words, we have that {a mathematical formula}betσ(A1,A2) is the true set of points that are located between {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}A2 with a relative distance from {a mathematical formula}A1 contained in σ, and similar for {a mathematical formula}parτ(A1,A2,A3). In particular, we have that{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Together with (30), (31) and the monotonicity of {a mathematical formula}fˆ w.r.t. set inclusion, this yields{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} for all {a mathematical formula}X1,X2,X3∈2B.

      <paragraph>
       Recall that the mapping {a mathematical formula}fˆ is unknown to us, and corresponds to the semantic counterpart of the ‘ideal’ rule base, containing all knowledge about m that can be encoded using the given vocabulary. However, given that {a mathematical formula}fˆ⩽fR is assumed to hold (i.e. all knowledge encoded in R is correct), (36) and (37) allow us to refine the mapping {a mathematical formula}fR, which is at our disposal, to the most conservative refinement {a mathematical formula}fRˆ that satisfies these two constraints, i.e. we define {a mathematical formula}fRˆ to be the largest fixpoint, w.r.t. the ordering ⩽ defined in (14), of{a mathematical formula} and {a mathematical formula}fRˆ(X)=⋃x∈XfRˆ({x}). From the well-known Knaster–Tarski theorem [52], we know that this largest fixpoint exists, and can be found in an iterative way as follows. Let {a mathematical formula}fRˆ(0)=fR and{a mathematical formula} and {a mathematical formula}fRˆ(i+1)(X)=⋃x∈XfRˆ(i+1)({x}). It is clear that {a mathematical formula}fRˆ(i+1)⩽fRˆ(i), i.e. this definition allows us to repeatedly refine the initial function {a mathematical formula}fRˆ(0). From the finiteness of the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}B and {a mathematical formula}C, it follows that this process must end, i.e. that there is an {a mathematical formula}i0∈N such that {a mathematical formula}fRˆ(i0+1)=fRˆ(i0)=fRˆ.

      Syntactic characterization
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      In this section, we will analyse how conceptual relations behave at the syntactic level, i.e. how available background information on betweenness and parallelism of atoms can be lifted to relations between arbitrary propositional formulas. Together with the meta-principles (S), (I), (Iʼ), (E), (Eʼ) and (D) introduced in Section 3.1, we will then be able to fully characterize a commonsense inference relation, and show its soundness and completeness w.r.t. the semantics from Section 5.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      As elements from {a mathematical formula}A can be identified with interpretations, any propositional formula α naturally corresponds to a set {a mathematical formula}set(α) of elements S from {a mathematical formula}A, which are the elements that correspond to the models of α, i.e. {a mathematical formula}set(α)={ω∈A|ω⊨Aα}. Conversely, every element {a mathematical formula}a=(a1,…,an) from {a mathematical formula}A corresponds to an interpretation, which can syntactically be characterized as a conjunction of atoms {a mathematical formula}a1∧⋯∧an; let us write {a mathematical formula}conj(a) for the conjunction corresponding to {a mathematical formula}a∈A.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      As input to the inference relation, in addition to the rule base R, we assume that a set of assertions Σ is given, which specifies the conceptual relations at the atom level. We define the closure {a mathematical formula}Σ⁎ of Σ to be the (infinite) set of all assertions that directly follow from assertions in Σ. In particular, we define {a mathematical formula}Σ⁎ as the smallest set of assertions which satisfies {a mathematical formula}Σ⊆Σ⁎, and moreover for all a, b, c, and d:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where we write {a mathematical formula}1−σ for the set {a mathematical formula}{1−x|x∈σ}. Note that even though the set {a mathematical formula}Σ⁎ is infinite, it is straightforward to decide whether a given assertion such as {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(a,b,c) is in {a mathematical formula}Σ⁎ from the definition of Σ. In the following, we will use the assumption that the assertions in Σ are sound in the following sense:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} for all labels a, b, c, d from the same attribute domain {a mathematical formula}Ai. In addition, the following assumptions are needed to show completeness, although they can be abandoned when completeness is not required (or feasible):{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} In the following, we do not explicitly consider {a mathematical formula}bet̲, {a mathematical formula}par̲, {a mathematical formula}bet¯ and {a mathematical formula}par¯, seeing these relations merely as abbreviations for {a mathematical formula}bet[0,1]̲, {a mathematical formula}par[0,+∞[̲, {a mathematical formula}bet[0,1]¯ and {a mathematical formula}par[0,+∞[¯.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Before we can characterize the conceptual relations, we need a syntactic counterpart for the notion of realizability, which played a key role in Section 5. As it turns out, at the syntactic level, realizability corresponds to a strong notion of consistency. More precisely, a formula α is called consistent if it has at least one model. Given a formula α, let us write {a mathematical formula}domains(α) for the set of attribute domains to which α refers, i.e. for each atom a occurring in α, the attribute domain {a mathematical formula}Ai which contains a will be in {a mathematical formula}domains(α). We then say that α is strongly consistent if there exists a consistent formula β such that {a mathematical formula}β⊨α and all attribute domains in {a mathematical formula}domains(α) are orthogonal to each other. The correspondence with realizability is demonstrated by the following lemma.

      It holds that a formula α is strongly consistent iff{a mathematical formula}set(α)is realizable.

      Complexity and implementation

     <paragraph>
      In this section, we first show that interpolative and extrapolative reasoning is PSPACE-hard in general. We then show in Section 7.4 that the complexity crucially depends on the number of attribute domains. In particular, we show that implementations in polynomial time are possible when the number of attribute domains is small enough to be treated as a constant (without placing any bounds on the number of attributes or the number of rules). From this result, it also follows that the inference problem considered in this paper is decidable in EXPTIME. However, whether this problem is also in PSPACE remains currently open.

       Hardness
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       We prove that interpolative and extrapolative reasoning are PSPACE-hard, by showing a reduction from the dominance problem for CP-nets [53]. We present two such reductions, one which is only based on interpolative reasoning and one which is only based on extrapolative reasoning.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Our terminology and notations are based on the presentation of CP-nets in [54], where a generalization of binary CP-nets is considered. The basic building blocks are conditional preference rules, which are expressions of the form {a mathematical formula}p:xi&gt;¬xi (or {a mathematical formula}p:¬xi&gt;xi) with p a propositional formula over a set of atoms {a mathematical formula}V={x1,…,xn} and {a mathematical formula}xi an atom from V. The intuitive meaning is that in situations where p holds, having {a mathematical formula}xi true is preferred to having {a mathematical formula}xi false. A (binary) GCP-net (generalized ceteris paribus net) over V is a set of such conditional preference rules. An outcome is an n-tuple {a mathematical formula}(I(x1),…,I(xn)) where I maps each variable to a value from {a mathematical formula}{true,false}, i.e. an outcome corresponds to a propositional interpretation. For the ease of presentation, we will identify an outcome with its corresponding mapping I. Let I and J be two outcomes, which differ only in the value of one variable {a mathematical formula}xi, such that {a mathematical formula}I(xi)=true and {a mathematical formula}J(xi)=false. If a GCP-net N contains a rule {a mathematical formula}p:xi&gt;¬xi (resp. {a mathematical formula}p:¬xi&gt;xi) such that the propositional formula p is satisfied by both I and J, we say that N sanctions an improving flip from J to I (resp. from I to J). Finally, we say that I dominates J, given N, if there is a sequence {a mathematical formula}J=J0,J1,…,Jm=I such that N sanctions an improving flip from {a mathematical formula}Ji to {a mathematical formula}Ji+1 for each i in {a mathematical formula}{0,…,m−1}. The problem of deciding, given two outcomes I and J, whether I dominates J is PSPACE-complete [54].

       Reduction to interpolative reasoning
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Given a GCP-net N and two outcomes I and J we now construct a rule base R and a set of assertions Σ such that I dominates J iff a particular rule can be derived from R using interpolative reasoning. We consider an attribute domain {a mathematical formula}Y={y0,y1,y2}, and one additional attribute domain {a mathematical formula}Xi for each variable {a mathematical formula}xi∈V, which is defined as{a mathematical formula} The set of rules R is obtained by adding for each conditional preference rule of the form {a mathematical formula}p:xi&gt;¬xi in N the rule{a mathematical formula} and for each conditional preference rule of the form {a mathematical formula}p:¬xi&gt;xi, we add to R the rule{a mathematical formula} Finally, we also add the rule{a mathematical formula} The underlying idea is combine rules of the form (84) with rules of the form (82) or (83) using inference rule (Iʼ) to simulate the idea of an improving flip. The antecedents of each of the newly generated rules will correspond to outcomes (where a conjunct {a mathematical formula}xi appears if {a mathematical formula}xi is true in the outcome, and a conjunct {a mathematical formula}xi¯ appears otherwise). To this end, for each conditional preference rule of the form {a mathematical formula}p:xi&gt;¬xi we add the assertion {a mathematical formula}bet[0,1]̲(xi¯,xi,xip) to Σ and for each conditional preference rule of the form {a mathematical formula}p:¬xi&gt;xi we add the assertion {a mathematical formula}bet[0,1]̲(xi,xi¯,xi¯p). We also add the assertion {a mathematical formula}bet[0,1]¯(y0,y1,y2).

       Reduction to extrapolative reasoning

      <paragraph>
       We now show that the idea of improving flips can also be simulated using extrapolative reasoning, i.e. using assertions about the relations {a mathematical formula}par̲ and {a mathematical formula}par¯ in Σ. With each variable {a mathematical formula}xi we now associate an attribute domain {a mathematical formula}Xi={xi,xi¯,xi′,xi′¯}. We consider one additional attribute domain {a mathematical formula}Y={y0,y1,y2,y−,y+} whose elements will again appear in the consequent of rules. Intuitively, {a mathematical formula}y1 is the degree to which outcome J is preferred, {a mathematical formula}y0 is a lower degree of preference and {a mathematical formula}y2 is a higher degree of preference. Furthermore, {a mathematical formula}y− represents a lower degree of preference than {a mathematical formula}y+, but the relation between {a mathematical formula}y− and {a mathematical formula}y+ on the one hand, and {a mathematical formula}y0, {a mathematical formula}y1 and {a mathematical formula}y2 on the other hand will remain unspecified. For each conditional preference rule {a mathematical formula}p:xi&gt;¬xi in N, we add the following two rules to R{a mathematical formula} The idea here is to indicate that the direction from having {a mathematical formula}xi false to having {a mathematical formula}xi true is towards more preferred outcomes when p is true. By using the attributes {a mathematical formula}xi′ and {a mathematical formula}xi′¯, rather than {a mathematical formula}xi and {a mathematical formula}xi¯ we can talk about the effect of changing the value of {a mathematical formula}xi without the need to specify to what degree {a mathematical formula}p∧xi and {a mathematical formula}p∧xi¯ are preferred. Similarly, for each preference rule of the form {a mathematical formula}p:¬xi&gt;xi, we add{a mathematical formula} Finally, we add the rule{a mathematical formula} For each i, we add the assertions {a mathematical formula}par[0,+∞[̲(xi′,xi′¯,xi;xi¯) and {a mathematical formula}par[0,+∞[̲(xi′¯,xi′,xi¯;xi) to Σ.

       Implementation

      <paragraph>
       In propositional logic, the number of possible interpretations is exponential in the number of atoms. In the present setting, on the other hand, the number of interpretations strongly depends on the number of attribute domains. If the number of attribute domains is small compared to the total number of atoms, the number of interpretations is essentially polynomial. For example, if there are only two attribute domains {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}A2, each of which contains {a mathematical formula}n2 atoms, then there are {a mathematical formula}(n2)2 interpretations. In such cases, it makes sense to rely on implementation methods that operate at the semantic level, even if that requires an enumeration of all interpretations.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Proposition 16">
       Consider a rule base R, where the antecedents of rules are built from the atoms in {a mathematical formula}B1,…,Bs and the consequents are built from {a mathematical formula}C1,…,Ck. From Proposition 13, we know that we can fully characterize interpolation and extrapolation on R by specifying the value of {a mathematical formula}fRˆ for each element {a mathematical formula}(x1,…,xs) of {a mathematical formula}B=B1×⋯×Bs. Moreover, from (38), we know that the function {a mathematical formula}fRˆ can be obtained in an iterative fashion, although the formulation in (38) cannot be used directly, as it involves intersections that range over arbitrary subsets of interpretations (of which there are at least exponentially many) and arbitrary subsets of {a mathematical formula}[0,1] and {a mathematical formula}[0,+∞[. The following proposition suggests a way to evaluate the right-hand side of (38) in practice. Let{a mathematical formula}x=(x1,…,xs). It holds that{a mathematical formula}where{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}

      <paragraph>
       Note in particular how Proposition 16 allows us to replace the range of the intersection over arbitrary subsets of {a mathematical formula}B to a range over conjunctions α, β and γ, of which there are polynomially many if the number of attribute domains is treated as a constant. Moreover, note how for each choice of these conjunctions, there is only one minimal choice for σ or τ, which can easily be found from Σ. This leads to the following procedure to characterize the function {a mathematical formula}fRˆ at the semantic level: repeat the following until {a mathematical formula}fRˆ(i)=fRˆ(i−1), starting with {a mathematical formula}i=1, for each {a mathematical formula}x∈B:

       Note that in step 2(a), it suffices to check whether {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(aij,xij,cij)∈Σ to verify {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢xij→aij⋈σcij, as all other cases where {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢xij→aij⋈σcij holds are covered in one way or another. Indeed, when {a mathematical formula}betσ′̲(aij,xij,cij)∈Σ, for some {a mathematical formula}σ′⊂σ, we have{a mathematical formula} so we do not need to consider {a mathematical formula}betσ̲ if we already consider {a mathematical formula}betσ′̲. The case where {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(cij,xij,aij)∈Σ is handled by swapping the definitions of α and γ. Finally, the cases where {a mathematical formula}xij=aij or {a mathematical formula}xij=cij do not need to be considered because then {a mathematical formula}x∈set(α) and {a mathematical formula}0∈σ, {a mathematical formula}x∈set(γ) and {a mathematical formula}1∈σ or {a mathematical formula}xij=aij=cij; in each of these cases we have {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(fRˆ(i−1)(set(α)),fRˆ(i−1)(set(γ)))⊆fRˆ(i−1)({xi}). Similar considerations apply to (b)–(d).

       It is clear that each of the steps (a)–(d) is polynomial in the size of {a mathematical formula}B, as is the number of arguments x for which these steps have to be completed. Finally, after each iteration, there is at least one element x from {a mathematical formula}B for which {a mathematical formula}fR(i)ˆ({x})⊂fR(i−1)ˆ({x}), unless {a mathematical formula}fR(i)ˆ=fRˆ after which we can stop. This means that the total number of iterations is upper bounded by {a mathematical formula}B×C, and is in particular polynomial in the size of {a mathematical formula}A. This means that the above procedure runs in polynomial time if the number of attribute domains n is small enough to be treated as a constant. In other words, interpolative and extrapolative reasoning is decidable in exponential time, and is polynomial in data complexity.

For example, interpolation is often applied to sets of parallel if-then rules, in which case the antecedent of every rule is built from the same attribute domains, and the consequent is a single atom, taken from a fixed attribute domain. In such a case it is not common to have more than a few attribute domains. As another example, consider a rule base {a mathematical formula}R=R1∪R2, such that the antecedents of rules in {a mathematical formula}R1 are built from the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}B1,…,Bk, the consequents of rules in {a mathematical formula}R1 and antecedents of rules in {a mathematical formula}R2 are built from the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}C1,…,Cs, and the consequents of rules in {a mathematical formula}R2 are built from the attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl, such that {a mathematical formula}{B1,…,Bk}∩{D1,…,Dl}=∅. In many situations, refining {a mathematical formula}R1 and {a mathematical formula}R2 separately would be equivalent to refining R as a whole. The following counterexample, however, shows that this is not the case in general.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph label="Example 20">
       Let {a mathematical formula}R=R1∪R2 with {a mathematical formula}R1={a1→a2,c1→c2} and {a mathematical formula}R2={a2→a3,c2→c3}, where the attribute domains are {a mathematical formula}A1={a1,b1,c1,d1}, {a mathematical formula}A2={a2,b2,c2,d2} and {a mathematical formula}A3={a3,b3,c3,d3}. Assume furthermore that Σ only contains the assertions {a mathematical formula}bet[0.5,0.5]̲(a1,b1,c1), {a mathematical formula}bet[0.5,0.5]¯(a2,b2,c2) and {a mathematical formula}bet[0.5,0.5]¯(a3,b3,c3). Since {a mathematical formula}R⊨a1→c1 and {a mathematical formula}R⊨a3→c3, using (S) and (Iʼ), we find {a mathematical formula}(R,Σ)⊢b1→b3. However, using {a mathematical formula}R1 only trivial information can be derived about {a mathematical formula}b1, hence refining {a mathematical formula}R1 and {a mathematical formula}R2 separately does not allow us to derive anything about {a mathematical formula}b1.

      Discussion

     <paragraph>
      As explained in Section 4.3, interpolative and extrapolative inference should provide sound conclusions as long as the rule base can be seen as the approximation of a mapping m which is linear, or in the case of interpolation, monotonic. In practice, however, this assumption may not be valid, in which case inconsistencies can be introduced by our method. In such cases, interpolative and extrapolative reasoning could still prove useful, although it should be applied more cautiously.

       Relaxing the linearity assumption
      </section-title>
      <paragraph>
       Consider the following rules, which contain information about the amount of traffic (light, moderate, heavy) at different times during the day:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Using (I) and the assumption that{a mathematical formula} we then derive the rule{a mathematical formula} which is in conflict with (88). This can be explained due to a failure of the monotonicity assumption. In the case of (87)–(89) the underlying mapping is not even deterministic, in the sense that the exact amount of traffic at e.g. 9 am may vary from day to day (even if we assume that the rule base talks about weekdays in a specific city). Nonetheless, even for rules where the linearity assumption fails, interpolation may still be useful. For instance, suppose we introduce the labels {a mathematical formula}mid-morning and {a mathematical formula}mid-afternoon, which are between morning and {a mathematical formula}mid-day, and between {a mathematical formula}mid-day and evening respectively. From (87) and (88) we may derive{a mathematical formula} Indeed, while the mapping underlying the rule base may, in principle, be arbitrary, it seems natural to assume that more regular mappings would be more likely, i.e. we could make the assumption that any completion of the knowledge base should not introduce additional irregularities. In particular, by identifying irregularities with violations of the monotonicity assumption, this leads to the assumption that the conceptual space {a mathematical formula}C1 corresponding with the antecedent of the rules can be partitioned in a minimal number of segments, such that the mapping is monotonic over these segments. In the traffic example, we would thus assume that the amount of traffic is monotonically decreasing throughout the morning and monotonically increasing throughout the afternoon. While such conclusions would not be valid in general, they are reasonable to make in absence of any other information. Depending on how the rule base (87)–(89) was obtained, we may also argue that the absence of a rule for {a mathematical formula}mid-morning suggests that this case is not special, i.e. that those cases which are irregular in some sense would be more likely to be contained in the rule base.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To avoid inconsistencies, the above view suggests that from a rule base R we should try to identify subsets {a mathematical formula}R1,…,Rk of rules, such that no inconsistencies arise as long as interpolation is applied to two rules from the same set {a mathematical formula}Ri. To be compatible with the above view, we should moreover insist that when {a mathematical formula}α→α1⋈α2, {a mathematical formula}(α1→β1)∈Ri, {a mathematical formula}(α2→β2)∈Ri and {a mathematical formula}(α→β)∈R, then we should have that {a mathematical formula}(α→β)∈Ri. In other words, the sub-bases {a mathematical formula}Ri should contain all rules that apply to a given (convex) segment of the conceptual space {a mathematical formula}C1. In this way, we can ensure that when a new rule {a mathematical formula}α⁎→β⁎ is derived by interpolation from a sub-base {a mathematical formula}Ri, the rules in {a mathematical formula}Ri are indeed the most relevant ones, i.e. that they are the ones whose antecedent is closest to {a mathematical formula}α⁎ in some sense. In a similar, but slightly less cautious fashion, we may assume that the mapping underlying the rule base R is piecewise linear, and apply extrapolation locally to the sub-bases {a mathematical formula}R1,…,Rk.

        Restricting to the most salient properties
       </section-title>
       <paragraph>
        Another reason why inconsistencies may arise is because the information about betweenness or analogical change is not accurate, or, more fundamentally, because it only takes the most salient properties of objects in the account. For example, when we derive betweenness information for wines from wine–food pairings, it will mainly reflect the taste of the wine, and to a much lesser extent properties such as price. As an additional example, we may consider that coffeehouses are conceptually between bars and restaurants, as both coffeehouses and bars emphasise drinking rather than eating, while coffeehouses generally do serve some food (sandwiches, cakes) as well. Nonetheless, we may consider that{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Using interpolation and the assumption{a mathematical formula} we derive the rule{a mathematical formula} which is in conflict with the rule base. In this case, the inconsistency is mainly due the fact that the property of serving wine was not considered when asserting that coffeehouses are between bars and restaurants. The most natural way to avoid inconsistencies would then be to avoid applying interpolation to derive conclusions from the domain {a mathematical formula}A={serves-wine,¬serves-wine}. In absence of any conflicts about attributes from a given domain, we then assume that interpolative and extrapolative conclusions are valid for that domain, an assumption which may need to be revised if additional knowledge became available.

If {a mathematical formula}a=b, it suffices to take {a mathematical formula}p=q and let r be an arbitrary element from {a mathematical formula}reg(X2), and similar for the case where {a mathematical formula}b=c. Otherwise, the vectors {a mathematical formula}a=(a1,…,al), {a mathematical formula}b=(b1,…,bl) and {a mathematical formula}c=(c1,…,cl) only differ in the ith component for some i, and we have {a mathematical formula}bet̲(ai,bi,ci).

We then easily find that {a mathematical formula}set(α)⊆betσ̲(set(β),set(γ)). Indeed, applying the definition of {a mathematical formula}betσ̲, given by (28), all attribute domains except for the one in which α, β and γ occur are deemed irrelevant, in which case {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(set(β),set(γ)) reduces to betweenness at the atom level.If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢α→β⋈σγ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet̲2), then there exist {a mathematical formula}α′, {a mathematical formula}β′, {a mathematical formula}γ′ and {a mathematical formula}σ′ such that {a mathematical formula}α⊨Aα′, {a mathematical formula}β′⊨Aβ and {a mathematical formula}γ′⊨Aγ, {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢α′→β′⋈σ′γ′, and {a mathematical formula}σ′⊆σ.

Since δ is strongly consistent, we can assume without lack of generality that the attribute domains in {a mathematical formula}domains(δ) are orthogonal to each other (since if this were not the case, we could replace δ with a logically equivalent formula for which this is the case). Since the elements of {a mathematical formula}domains(δ) are moreover orthogonal to the elements of {a mathematical formula}domains(β′) and {a mathematical formula}domains(γ′), it is not hard to see that {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(set(β′),set(γ′))∩set(δ)⊆betσ̲(set(β′)∩set(δ),set(γ′)∩set(δ)). Indeed, this is trivial if {a mathematical formula}β′ or {a mathematical formula}γ′ is not strongly consistent. If both are strongly consistent, then let {a mathematical formula}b∈betσ̲(set(β′),set(γ′))∩set(δ) and let {a mathematical formula}b′ be the vector obtained from b after removing the components of all irrelevant attribute domains. Then there are corresponding subvectors {a mathematical formula}a′ and {a mathematical formula}c′ of elements in {a mathematical formula}set(β′) and {a mathematical formula}set(γ′) respectively, such that {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(a′,b′,c′) holds. Now {a mathematical formula}a′, {a mathematical formula}b′ and {a mathematical formula}c′ can be extended to vectors {a mathematical formula}a″, {a mathematical formula}b″ and {a mathematical formula}c″ by adding the components from {a mathematical formula}domains(δ), choosing the same values as in b. Then it clearly holds that {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(a″,b″,c″), while any extension of {a mathematical formula}a″ and {a mathematical formula}b″ to full vectors a and b will belong to {a mathematical formula}set(δ), leading to {a mathematical formula}b∈betσ̲(set(β′)∩set(δ),set(γ′)∩set(δ)). Hence, we have {a mathematical formula}set(α′)∩set(δ)⊆betσ̲(set(β′)∩set(δ),set(γ′)∩set(δ)), which is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}set(α′∧δ)⊆betσ̲(set(β′∧δ),set(γ′∧δ)) and to {a mathematical formula}set(α)⊆betσ̲(set(β),set(γ)).If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢α→β⋈γ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet8̲), there are {a mathematical formula}α1, {a mathematical formula}α2, {a mathematical formula}β1, {a mathematical formula}β2, {a mathematical formula}γ1 and {a mathematical formula}γ2 such that {a mathematical formula}α=α1∧α2, {a mathematical formula}β=β1∧β2 and {a mathematical formula}γ=γ1∧γ2, such that, by induction, {a mathematical formula}set(α1)⊆bet[λ,λ]̲(set(β1),set(γ1)) and {a mathematical formula}set(α2)⊆bet[λ,λ]̲(set(β2),set(γ2)). Given the definition of {a mathematical formula}bet[λ,λ]̲ and given the fact that the attribute domains in {a mathematical formula}domains(β1)∪domains(γ1) are orthogonal to those in {a mathematical formula}domains(β2)∪domains(γ2), we can show that {a mathematical formula}bet[λ,λ]̲(set(β1),set(γ1))∩bet[λ,λ]̲(set(β2),set(γ2))⊆bet[λ,λ]̲(set(β1)∩set(β2),set(γ1)∩set(γ2)). If {a mathematical formula}λ=0 or {a mathematical formula}λ=1 then this is trivial. If {a mathematical formula}λ∈]0,1[, from {a mathematical formula}b∈bet[λ,λ]̲(set(β1),set(γ1))∩bet[λ,λ]̲(set(β2),set(set(γ2)), we find that there are two non-overlapping subvectors {a mathematical formula}b1 and {a mathematical formula}b2 of b (containing components for the attribute domains in {a mathematical formula}domains(β1)∪domains(γ1) and {a mathematical formula}domains(β2)∪domains(γ2) respectively) and such that {a mathematical formula}bet[λ,λ]̲(a1,b1,c1) and {a mathematical formula}bet[λ,λ]̲(a2,b2,c2) hold, for appropriate subvectors of elements a and c from {a mathematical formula}set(β1∧β2) and {a mathematical formula}set(γ1∧γ2). By definition of {a mathematical formula}bet[λ,λ]̲, we then get that {a mathematical formula}bet[λ,λ]̲(a12,b12,c12) holds for the compound vectors, from which we find that {a mathematical formula}b∈bet[λ,λ]̲(set(β1)∩set(β2),set(γ1)∩set(γ2)). Thus we find that{a mathematical formula} which is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}set(α1∧α2)⊆betσ̲(set(β1∧β2),set(γ1∧γ2)) and to {a mathematical formula}set(α)⊆betσ̲(set(β),set(γ)).The case where {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢α→β⋈γ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet̲9) is trivial.

        Now we assume that {a mathematical formula}set(α)⊆betσ̲(set(β),set(γ)) and show that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢α→β⋈σγ can be derived from the inference rules {a mathematical formula}(bet̲1)–{a mathematical formula}(bet9̲). If α is inconsistent, then {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢α→β⋈σγ follows from {a mathematical formula}(bet̲9) and {a mathematical formula}(bet2̲). Otherwise, given that {a mathematical formula}(bet2̲) entails syntax-independence, we can assume without lack of generality that α is of the form {a mathematical formula}α1∨⋯∨αr, where each {a mathematical formula}αi is a conjunction containing exactly one atom from each attribute domain. In other words, {a mathematical formula}set(αi)={a} is a singleton. Because of inference rules {a mathematical formula}(bet̲6) and {a mathematical formula}(bet2̲), it suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢αi→β⋈σγ can be derived for each i.The fact that {a mathematical formula}a∈betσ̲(set(β),set(γ)) either means that (i) {a mathematical formula}a∈set(β)∪set(γ), (ii) there is a {a mathematical formula}b∈set(β) and {a mathematical formula}c∈set(γ) such that {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(b,a,c) holds, or (iii) it holds that {a mathematical formula}a↓j∈betσ̲(set(β)↓j,set(γ)↓j) for some j, where we write {a mathematical formula}a↓j for the vector a without the jth component and {a mathematical formula}set(β)↓j and {a mathematical formula}set(γ)↓j are defined as in (22).In the first case, if {a mathematical formula}a∈set(β)∖set(γ) this means that {a mathematical formula}set(γ) is realizable and {a mathematical formula}0∈σ (by (28)), hence that γ is strongly consistent (by Lemma 1). This means that we can derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢αi→αi⋈σγ using {a mathematical formula}(bet4̲). Using {a mathematical formula}(bet̲2), we can then also conclude {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢αi→β⋈σγ given that {a mathematical formula}a∈set(β). In the same way, if {a mathematical formula}a∈set(γ)∖set(β), we derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢αi→γ⋈1−σβ, and using {a mathematical formula}(bet3̲) also {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢αi→β⋈σγ. If {a mathematical formula}a∈set(β)∩set(γ), using {a mathematical formula}(bet5̲) we derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢αi→αi⋈σαi from which we derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢αi→β⋈σγ by {a mathematical formula}(bet2̲).In the second case, we clearly have that {a mathematical formula}conj(b)⊨Aβ and {a mathematical formula}conj(c)⊨Aγ, hence because of inference rule {a mathematical formula}(bet2̲) it suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢conj(a)→conj(b)⋈σconj(c) can be derived. By definition, {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(b,a,c) means that all components correspond to orthogonal attribute domains. First assume that σ is a non-degenerate interval. We then have that either (i) {a mathematical formula}a=b, (ii) {a mathematical formula}a=c, or (iii) that a differs only in one component from b and c, and that component in a is moreover between the corresponding components in b and c. In the latter situation, {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢conj(a)→conj(b)⋈σconj(c) can clearly be derived using inference rules {a mathematical formula}(bet1̲) (given (43)) and {a mathematical formula}(bet̲7), whereas when {a mathematical formula}a=b, it can be derived using {a mathematical formula}(bet4̲), and when {a mathematical formula}a=c it can be derived using {a mathematical formula}(bet4̲) and {a mathematical formula}(bet3̲). Now assume that {a mathematical formula}σ=[λ,λ] is a degenerate interval. Then we have {a mathematical formula}bet[λ,λ]̲(bi,ai,ci) for every i, hence we can derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢conj(a)→conj(b)⋈σconj(c) by repeatedly applying {a mathematical formula}(bet̲1) and then using {a mathematical formula}(bet8̲).In the third case, note that {a mathematical formula}set(β)↓j and {a mathematical formula}set(γ)↓j correspond to formulas {a mathematical formula}β⁎ and {a mathematical formula}γ⁎ such that {a mathematical formula}β⁎⊨Aβ and {a mathematical formula}γ⁎⊨Aγ. Moreover, {a mathematical formula}αi is of the form {a mathematical formula}conj(a↓j)∧x for some atom x, and in particular we have that {a mathematical formula}αi⊨Aconj(a↓j). By induction, we can moreover assume that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢conj(a↓j)→β⁎⋈σγ⁎ can be derived. Using {a mathematical formula}(bet2̲) this means that also {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢αi→β⋈σγ can be derived.  □

        Assume that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β⋈σγ→α can be derived from the inference rules {a mathematical formula}(bet¯1)–{a mathematical formula}(bet¯6). We show by induction that then {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β),set(γ))⊆set(α).If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β⋈σγ→α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯1), then it is not hard to see from (40) that {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β),set(γ))⊆set(α).If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β⋈σγ→α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯2), then there exist {a mathematical formula}α′, {a mathematical formula}β′, {a mathematical formula}γ′ and {a mathematical formula}σ′ such that {a mathematical formula}α′⊨Aα, {a mathematical formula}β⊨Aβ′, {a mathematical formula}γ⊨Aγ′, {a mathematical formula}σ⊆σ′ and {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β′⋈σ′γ′→α′. By induction, we then have that {a mathematical formula}betσ′¯(set(β′),set(γ′))⊆set(α′), while {a mathematical formula}set(α′)⊆set(α), {a mathematical formula}set(β)⊆set(β′) and {a mathematical formula}set(γ)⊆set(γ′). By the fact that {a mathematical formula}betσ¯ is clearly monotonic w.r.t. set inclusion, it follows that {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β),set(γ))⊆set(α).The case where {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β⋈σγ→α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯3) immediately follows from the definition of {a mathematical formula}bet¯.If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β⋈σγ→α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯4), then there exist {a mathematical formula}α1, {a mathematical formula}α2, {a mathematical formula}β1 and {a mathematical formula}β2 such that {a mathematical formula}α=α1∨α2, {a mathematical formula}β=β1∨β2, and, by induction, {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β1),set(γ))⊆set(α1) and {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β2),set(γ))⊆set(α2). We have that {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β),set(γ))=betσ¯(set(β1∨β2),set(γ))=betσ¯(set(β1)∪set(β2),set(γ)). From the definition of {a mathematical formula}betσ¯ it easily follows that the latter expression is equal to {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β1),set(γ))∪betσ¯(set(β2),set(γ)). By the assumption, this latter expression is known to be included in {a mathematical formula}set(α1)∨set(α2), which is equal to {a mathematical formula}set(α).If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β⋈σγ→α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯5), then there exist {a mathematical formula}α1, {a mathematical formula}α2, {a mathematical formula}β1, {a mathematical formula}β2, {a mathematical formula}γ1 and {a mathematical formula}γ2 such that {a mathematical formula}α=α1∧α2, {a mathematical formula}β=β1∧β2, {a mathematical formula}γ=γ1∧γ2 and, by induction, {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β1),set(γ1))⊆set(α1) and {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β2),set(γ2))⊆set(α2). Now we have that {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β1∧β2),set(γ1∧γ2))=betσ¯(set(β1)∩set(β2),set(γ1)∩set(γ2))⊆betσ¯(set(β1),set(γ1))⊆set(α1), using the monotonicity of {a mathematical formula}betσ¯ w.r.t. set inclusion and using induction. For the same reason we also find {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β1∧β2),set(γ1∧γ2))⊆set(α2), which allows us to conclude that {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(set(β1∧β2),set(γ1∧γ2))⊆set(α1)∩set(α2)=set(α1∧α2).The case where {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β⋈σγ→α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯6) is trivial.

If γ is inconsistent, then {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β⋈σγ→α can be derived using {a mathematical formula}(bet¯3) and {a mathematical formula}(bet¯6). If neither of β and γ is inconsistent (which implies that α cannot be inconsistent either), given that {a mathematical formula}(bet¯2) entails syntax-independence, we can assume without lack of generality that {a mathematical formula}α=α1∨⋯∨αr, {a mathematical formula}β=β1∨⋯∨βs and {a mathematical formula}γ=γ1∨⋯∨γt, where each {a mathematical formula}αi, {a mathematical formula}βi and {a mathematical formula}γi is a conjunction containing exactly one atom from each attribute domain.

In particular, we also find that for every i and j there are {a mathematical formula}k1,…,kl such that {a mathematical formula}betσ¯(bi,cj)⊆{ak1,…,akl}. The latter inclusion means that every component of each of {a mathematical formula}ak1,…,akl is between the corresponding components of {a mathematical formula}bi and {a mathematical formula}cj, and furthermore that there are no other such vectors.

        Assume that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 can be derived from the inference rules {a mathematical formula}(par̲1)–{a mathematical formula}(par12̲). We show by induction that then {a mathematical formula}set(δ)⊆parτ̲(set(α),set(β),set(γ)).If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par1̲), then α, β, γ and δ are atoms and we have from (41) that {a mathematical formula}parτ̲(α,β,γ;δ) holds, from which we find {a mathematical formula}set(δ)⊆parτ̲(set(α),set(β),set(γ)).If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par2̲), then there exist {a mathematical formula}α′, {a mathematical formula}β′, {a mathematical formula}γ′, {a mathematical formula}δ′ and {a mathematical formula}τ′ such that {a mathematical formula}α′⊨Aα, {a mathematical formula}β′⊨Aβ, {a mathematical formula}γ′⊨Aγ, {a mathematical formula}δ⊨Aδ′, {a mathematical formula}τ′⊆τ and {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ′→γ′▷τ′〈α′,β′〉. By induction, we then have that {a mathematical formula}set(δ′)⊆parτ′̲(set(α′),set(β′),set(γ′)), while {a mathematical formula}set(α′)⊆set(α), {a mathematical formula}set(β′)⊆set(β), {a mathematical formula}set(γ′)⊆set(γ), and {a mathematical formula}set(δ)⊆set(δ′). By the fact that {a mathematical formula}parτ̲ is clearly monotonic w.r.t. set inclusion, it follows that {a mathematical formula}set(δ)⊆parτ̲(set(α),set(β),set(γ)).The case where {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par3̲) follows immediately from the definition of {a mathematical formula}parτ̲, given that the strong consistency of α implies that {a mathematical formula}set(α) is realizable (by Lemma 1).The case where {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par4̲) follows immediately from the fact that {a mathematical formula}parτ̲(X1,X2,X3)⊇X1∩X2∩X3 according to (29).The cases where {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par5̲), {a mathematical formula}(par̲6), {a mathematical formula}(par7̲) and {a mathematical formula}(par̲8) are entirely analogous.If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par9̲), then there exist {a mathematical formula}α1, {a mathematical formula}α2, {a mathematical formula}β1, {a mathematical formula}β2, {a mathematical formula}γ1, {a mathematical formula}γ2, {a mathematical formula}δ1 and {a mathematical formula}δ2 such that {a mathematical formula}α=α1∨α2, {a mathematical formula}β=β1∨β2, {a mathematical formula}γ=γ1∨γ2, {a mathematical formula}δ=δ1∨δ2 and, by induction, {a mathematical formula}set(δ1)⊆parτ̲(set(α1),set(β1),set(γ1)) and {a mathematical formula}set(δ2)⊆parτ̲(set(α2),set(β2),set(γ2)). We have{a mathematical formula} From the monotonicity of {a mathematical formula}parτ̲ it easily follows that{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Hence, we obtain {a mathematical formula}set(α1)∪set(α2)⊆parτ̲(set(α1)∪set(α2),set(β1)∪set(β2),set(γ1)∪set(γ2)) which is equivalent to what we need to prove.If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par10̲), then there exist {a mathematical formula}α′, {a mathematical formula}β′ and ϕ such that {a mathematical formula}α=α′∧ϕ and {a mathematical formula}β=β′∧ϕ and, by induction, {a mathematical formula}set(δ)⊆parτ̲(set(α′),set(β′),set(γ)).

        Now we assume that {a mathematical formula}set(δ)⊆parτ̲(set(α),set(β),set(γ)) and show that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 can be derived from the inference rules {a mathematical formula}(par1̲)–{a mathematical formula}(par̲12). If either of α, β or γ is inconsistent, then we must have that {a mathematical formula}set(δ)=∅, i.e. that δ is inconsistent as well. This means that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δ→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 can be derived from {a mathematical formula}(par12̲) and {a mathematical formula}(par2̲).If α, β and γ are consistent, given that {a mathematical formula}(par2̲) entails syntax-independence, we can assume without lack of generality that δ is of the form {a mathematical formula}δ1∨⋯∨δr, where each {a mathematical formula}δi is a conjunction containing exactly one atom from each attribute domain. In other words, {a mathematical formula}set(δi)={d} is a singleton. Because of inference rules {a mathematical formula}(par9̲) and {a mathematical formula}(par̲2), it suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 can be derived for each i.The fact that {a mathematical formula}d∈parτ̲(set(α),set(β),set(γ)) either means that (i) {a mathematical formula}d∈set(β)∪set(γ), (ii) there is an {a mathematical formula}a∈set(α), {a mathematical formula}b∈set(β) and {a mathematical formula}c∈set(γ) such that {a mathematical formula}parτ̲(a,b,c;d) holds, (iii) it holds that {a mathematical formula}d↓j∈parτ̲(set(α)↓j,set(β)↓j,set(γ)↓j) for some j, where we write {a mathematical formula}d↓j for the vector d without the jth component and {a mathematical formula}set(α)↓j, {a mathematical formula}set(β)↓j and {a mathematical formula}set(γ)↓j are defined as in (22), or (iv) it holds that {a mathematical formula}d↓j∈parτ̲(set(α)↓j,set(β)↓y,set(γ)↓y) for some j and some y from the corresponding attribute domain.In the first case, if moreover {a mathematical formula}d∈set(β)∩set(γ)∩set(α), we can derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→δi▷τ〈δi,δi〉 using {a mathematical formula}(par4̲), and subsequently also that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 using {a mathematical formula}(par̲2). If {a mathematical formula}d∈(set(β)∩set(γ))∖set(α), we know that α is strongly consistent and {a mathematical formula}0∈τ, which means that we can derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→δi▷τ〈α,δi〉 using {a mathematical formula}(par̲8) and thus {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 using {a mathematical formula}(par2̲). The case where {a mathematical formula}d∈(set(α)∩set(γ))∖set(β) is entirely analogous (using {a mathematical formula}(par7̲) instead of {a mathematical formula}(par̲8)). If {a mathematical formula}d∈set(β)∖(set(α)∪set(γ)), we know that {a mathematical formula}α∧γ is strongly consistent and {a mathematical formula}1∈τ, hence we can derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→α∧γ▷τ〈α∧γ,δi〉 using {a mathematical formula}(par3̲) and again {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 using {a mathematical formula}(par2̲). If {a mathematical formula}d∈set(γ)∖(set(α)∪set(β)), we know that either α and β are strongly consistent and {a mathematical formula}0∈τ or that {a mathematical formula}α∧β is strongly consistent, hence we can either derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→δi▷τ〈α,β〉 using {a mathematical formula}(par6̲), or we can derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→δi▷τ〈α∧β,α∧β〉 using {a mathematical formula}(par5̲). In both cases, we then find {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 using {a mathematical formula}(par̲2).In the second case, we clearly have that {a mathematical formula}conj(a)⊨Aα, {a mathematical formula}conj(b)⊨Aβ and {a mathematical formula}conj(c)⊨Aγ, hence because of inference rule {a mathematical formula}(par̲2) it suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢conj(d)→conj(c)▷τ〈conj(a),conj(b)〉 can be derived. From the definition of {a mathematical formula}parτ̲, we know that all components correspond to orthogonal attribute domains. Moreover, either

Moreover, {a mathematical formula}δi is of the form {a mathematical formula}conj(d↓j)∧x for some atom x, and in particular we have that {a mathematical formula}δi⊨Aconj(d↓j). By induction, we can moreover assume that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢conj(d↓j)→γ⁎▷τ〈α⁎,β⁎〉 can be derived. Using {a mathematical formula}(par2̲) this means that also {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 can be derived.In the fourth case, we have that {a mathematical formula}set(α)↓j, {a mathematical formula}set(β)↓j and {a mathematical formula}set(γ)↓j correspond to formulas {a mathematical formula}α⁎, {a mathematical formula}β⁎ and {a mathematical formula}γ⁎ such that {a mathematical formula}α⁎⊨Aα, {a mathematical formula}β⁎∧y⊨Aβ and {a mathematical formula}γ⁎∧y⊨Aγ. Using {a mathematical formula}(par̲10) (for {a mathematical formula}ψ=⊤ and {a mathematical formula}ϕ=y) and {a mathematical formula}(par̲2), we again find that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢δi→γ▷τ〈α,β〉 can be derived. □

        Assume that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ▷τ〈α,β〉→δ can be derived from the inference rules {a mathematical formula}(par¯1)–{a mathematical formula}(par¯9). We show by induction that then{a mathematical formula}If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ▷τ〈α,β〉→δ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par¯1), then it is not hard to see from (42) that {a mathematical formula}set(δ)={d|parτ¯(a,b,c;d),a∈set(α),b∈set(β),c∈set(γ)}, from which we immediately find{a mathematical formula}If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ▷τ〈α,β〉→δ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par¯2), then there exist {a mathematical formula}α′, {a mathematical formula}β′, {a mathematical formula}γ′, {a mathematical formula}δ′ and {a mathematical formula}τ′ such that {a mathematical formula}α⊨Aα′, {a mathematical formula}β⊨Aβ′, {a mathematical formula}γ⊨Aγ′, {a mathematical formula}δ′⊨Aδ and {a mathematical formula}τ′⊆τ, and {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ′▷τ′〈α′,β′〉→δ′. By induction, we then have that {a mathematical formula}parτ′¯(set(α′),set(β′),set(γ′))⊆set(δ′), while {a mathematical formula}set(α)⊆set(α′), {a mathematical formula}set(β)⊆set(β′), {a mathematical formula}set(γ)⊆set(γ′) and {a mathematical formula}set(δ′)⊆set(δ). By the fact that {a mathematical formula}parτ¯ is clearly monotonic w.r.t. set inclusion, it follows that {a mathematical formula}parτ¯(set(α),set(β),set(γ))⊆set(δ).If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ▷τ〈α,β〉→δ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par¯3), then there exist {a mathematical formula}α1, {a mathematical formula}α2, {a mathematical formula}δ1 and {a mathematical formula}δ2 such that {a mathematical formula}α=α1∨α2, {a mathematical formula}δ=δ1∨δ2 and, by induction, {a mathematical formula}parτ¯(set(α1),set(β),set(γ))⊆set(δ1) and {a mathematical formula}parτ¯(set(α2),set(β),set(γ))⊆set(δ2). Now, we have that {a mathematical formula}parτ¯(set(α),set(β),set(γ))=parτ¯(set(α1)∪set(α2),set(β),set(γ)). From the definition of {a mathematical formula}parτ¯ it easily follows that the latter expression is equal to{a mathematical formula} By the assumption, this latter expression is known to be included in {a mathematical formula}set(δ1)∨set(δ2), which is equal to {a mathematical formula}set(δ).The cases where {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ▷τ〈α,β〉→δ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par¯4) or from {a mathematical formula}(par¯5) are entirely analogous.If {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ▷τ〈α,β〉→δ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par¯6), then there exist {a mathematical formula}α1, {a mathematical formula}α2, {a mathematical formula}β1, {a mathematical formula}β2, {a mathematical formula}γ1, {a mathematical formula}γ2, {a mathematical formula}δ1 and {a mathematical formula}δ2 such that {a mathematical formula}α=α1∧α2, {a mathematical formula}β=β1∧β2, {a mathematical formula}γ=γ1∧γ2, {a mathematical formula}δ=δ1∧δ2 and, by induction, {a mathematical formula}parτ¯(set(α1),set(β1),set(γ1))⊆set(δ1) and {a mathematical formula}parτ¯(set(α2),set(β2),set(γ2))⊆set(δ2). Given the monotonicity of {a mathematical formula}par¯ w.r.t. set inclusion, we have that{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} which leads to {a mathematical formula}parτ¯(set(α),set(β),set(γ))⊆set(δ).The cases where {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ▷τ〈α,β〉→δ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par¯7), {a mathematical formula}(par¯8) or {a mathematical formula}(par¯9) are trivial.

        Now we assume that {a mathematical formula}parτ¯(set(α),set(β),set(γ))⊆set(δ) and show that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ▷τ〈α,β〉→δ can be derived from the inference rules {a mathematical formula}(par¯1)–{a mathematical formula}(par¯9). If α, β or γ is inconsistent, {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ▷τ〈α,β〉→δ can be inferred immediately using {a mathematical formula}(par¯7)–{a mathematical formula}(par¯9) and {a mathematical formula}(par¯2).If neither of α, β and γ is inconsistent, given that {a mathematical formula}(par¯2) entails syntax-independence, we can assume without lack of generality that {a mathematical formula}α=α1∨⋯∨αr, {a mathematical formula}β=β1∨⋯∨βs, {a mathematical formula}γ=γ1∨⋯∨γt, {a mathematical formula}δ=δ1∨⋯∨δu where each {a mathematical formula}αi, {a mathematical formula}βi, {a mathematical formula}γi and {a mathematical formula}δi is a conjunction containing exactly one atom from each attribute domain. In other words, {a mathematical formula}set(αi)={ai}, {a mathematical formula}set(βi)={bi}, {a mathematical formula}set(γi)={ci} and {a mathematical formula}set(δi)={di} are singletons. By definition of {a mathematical formula}parτ¯, we then have that {a mathematical formula}parτ¯(set(α),set(β),set(γ))=⋃i,j,lparτ¯(ai,bj,cl). In particular, we also find that for every i, j and l there are {a mathematical formula}k1,…,kr such that {a mathematical formula}parτ¯(ai,bj,cl)⊆{dk1,…,dkr}. The latter inclusion means that the respective components of {a mathematical formula}ai, {a mathematical formula}bj, {a mathematical formula}cl on the one hand and {a mathematical formula}dk1,…,dkr on the other hand all define parallel directions, and in particular that we can derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γl▷τ〈αi,βj〉→δk1∨⋯∨δkr using inference rules {a mathematical formula}(par¯1) (considering that (46)) and {a mathematical formula}(par¯6). As we can do this for all i, j and l, {a mathematical formula}(par¯3), {a mathematical formula}(par¯4) and {a mathematical formula}(par¯5) allow us to derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢γ▷τ〈α,β〉→δ. □

     <paragraph label="Proof of Proposition 13">
      Before we move to the actual proof, we introduce some notations. Recall that for any formula α, {a mathematical formula}set(α) was defined to be a subset of {a mathematical formula}A. However, if {a mathematical formula}domains(α)⊆{B1,…,Bs}, then the attribute domains in {a mathematical formula}{C1,…,Ck}∖{B1,…,Bs} are redundant, as they are not constrained by α. Throughout the proof, we will use the notation {a mathematical formula}setB(α) to denote the restriction of the vectors in {a mathematical formula}set(α) to the components corresponding to attribute domains from {a mathematical formula}B, and similar for the notation {a mathematical formula}setC(α). For a vector {a mathematical formula}x∈A, we also write {a mathematical formula}xB and {a mathematical formula}xC for its restriction to the attribute domains in {a mathematical formula}{B1,…,Bs} and in {a mathematical formula}{C1,…,Ck} respectively. Moreover, it should be clear from the definition of e.g. {a mathematical formula}betσ̲ that when {a mathematical formula}domains(β1)⊆{B1,…,Bs}, {a mathematical formula}domains(β2)⊆{B1,…,Bs}, and {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(set(β1),set(β2)) then we also have {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(setB(β1),setB(β2)), and similar for {a mathematical formula}betσ¯, {a mathematical formula}parσ̲ and {a mathematical formula}parσ¯, and for situations where the attribute domains are restricted to {a mathematical formula}{C1,…,Ck}.

       We show by induction on n that whenever {a mathematical formula}fRˆ(n)(X)⊆Y, it holds that{a mathematical formula} The base case is straightforward: if {a mathematical formula}fR(X)⊆Y, then by construction of {a mathematical formula}fR, it holds that{a mathematical formula} and thus (A.8) by inference rule (S).To show the induction step, because of inference rule (D), it suffices to show that for each {a mathematical formula}x=(x1,…,xn) in X, it holds that{a mathematical formula} From {a mathematical formula}fRˆ(n+1)({x})⊆Y, by definition of {a mathematical formula}fRˆ(n+1) we have that there exist {a mathematical formula}Y1,…,Ym, {a mathematical formula}Z1,…,Zm, {a mathematical formula}σ1,…,σm, {a mathematical formula}U1,…,Ul, {a mathematical formula}V1,…,Vl, {a mathematical formula}W1,…,Wl and {a mathematical formula}τ1,…,τl such that{a mathematical formula} and moreover {a mathematical formula}x∈betσi̲(Yi,Zi) for each {a mathematical formula}i∈{1,…,m} and {a mathematical formula}x∈parτi̲(Ui,Vi,Wi) for each {a mathematical formula}i∈{1,…,l}.By induction, we know that for each {a mathematical formula}Yj, it holds that{a mathematical formula} and similar for {a mathematical formula}Zj, {a mathematical formula}Uj, {a mathematical formula}Vj and {a mathematical formula}Wj. Furthermore, from {a mathematical formula}x∈bet̲(Yi,Zi) we find using Proposition 9 that{a mathematical formula} Similarly, from {a mathematical formula}x∈par̲(Uj,Vj,Wj), we find using Proposition 11 that{a mathematical formula} Using Proposition 10, Proposition 12, we trivially derive{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Using inference rules (Iʼ) and (Eʼ), together this allows us to derive{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Using inference rule (S), we find the trivial rule{a mathematical formula} By two repeated applications of (D) to combine (A.11), (A.12) and (A.13), we find{a mathematical formula} Finally, from (A.10), it follows that we can apply (D) one more time to weaken the latter rule, from which we obtain (A.9). □

      The rule base R initially contains two types of rules. On the one hand, there is (84), whose antecedent corresponds to the outcome J, while on the other hand, there are rules of the form (82) and (83), whose antecedent does not correspond to any outcome at all. Clearly, non-trivial new rules can only be obtained from R by using interpolative reasoning. More specifically, initially, we can only combine the rule (84) with one of the other rules to yield a new rule {a mathematical formula}r1, whose consequent is of the form {a mathematical formula}y1∨y2 and whose antecedent only differs from the antecedent of (84) in that an atom of the form {a mathematical formula}xi has been replaced by {a mathematical formula}xi¯, or an atom of the form {a mathematical formula}xi¯ has been replaced by {a mathematical formula}xi. Moreover, this application of interpolation can only be applied if the antecedents of both (84) and {a mathematical formula}r1 satisfy the proposition p. Thus it is clear that the antecedent of {a mathematical formula}r1 corresponds to an outcome {a mathematical formula}J1 such that there is an improving flip from J to {a mathematical formula}J1. We can then combine {a mathematical formula}r1 with some rule of the form (82) or (83) to obtain a new rule {a mathematical formula}r2 whose antecedent corresponds to an outcome {a mathematical formula}J2 such that there is an improving flip from {a mathematical formula}J1 to {a mathematical formula}J2. It is thus clear that a rule of the form (85) can only be derived if there is a sequence of outcomes {a mathematical formula}J,J1,…,Jm,I that corresponds to a sequence of improving flips, i.e. if I dominates J. Conversely, it is also clear that if there is an improving flip from {a mathematical formula}Ji to {a mathematical formula}Ji+1, we will be able to derive the corresponding rule {a mathematical formula}ri+1 once {a mathematical formula}ri has been derived. □

      By construction, it is clear that{a mathematical formula} To show that the inclusion also holds in the other direction, let Y and Z be subsets of {a mathematical formula}B such that {a mathematical formula}x∈betσ̲(Y,Z). We show that there are formulas α and γ such that condition {a mathematical formula}c1 or {a mathematical formula}c2 is satisfied and{a mathematical formula} First assume that all attribute domains are orthogonal. If {a mathematical formula}x∈Y and {a mathematical formula}0∈σ, then we will have{a mathematical formula} and (A.14) is satisfied (regardless of the choice of α and γ). Similarly, we find that (A.14) is satisfied if {a mathematical formula}x∈Z and {a mathematical formula}1∈σ. If {a mathematical formula}x∈Y∩Z, we find for any (non-empty) σ that{a mathematical formula} and therefore again (A.14). If there are {a mathematical formula}y∈Y and {a mathematical formula}z∈Z such that {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(y,x,z), then either we have {a mathematical formula}y=x and {a mathematical formula}0∈σ or {a mathematical formula}y=z and {a mathematical formula}1∈σ or {a mathematical formula}x=y=z, which are already covered, or we have that {a mathematical formula}c1 or {a mathematical formula}c2 is satisfied for {a mathematical formula}α=conj(y) and {a mathematical formula}γ=conj(z). In the latter two cases we have{a mathematical formula} and thus also (A.14).Now assume that some attribute domains are not orthogonal, but that {a mathematical formula}conj(x)=xj∧conj(x′) with {a mathematical formula}x′∈betσ̲(Y↓j,Z↓j). If {a mathematical formula}x′∈Y↓j, {a mathematical formula}0∈σ and the remaining attribute domains are orthogonal, we have{a mathematical formula} The case where {a mathematical formula}x′∈Z↓j and {a mathematical formula}1∈σ is entirely analogous. If the remaining attribute domains are orthogonal and there are {a mathematical formula}y′∈Y↓j and {a mathematical formula}z′∈Z↓j such that {a mathematical formula}betσ̲(y′,x′,z′), we can take {a mathematical formula}α=conj(y′) and {a mathematical formula}γ=conj(z′). The case where {a mathematical formula}conj(x′)=xl∧conj(x″) with {a mathematical formula}x″∈betσ̲(Y↓j↓l,Z↓j↓l) is handled by repeating the same argument.In entirely the same way, we show that for subsets X, Y and Z of {a mathematical formula}B such that {a mathematical formula}x∈parτ̲(X,Y,Z), there exist conjunctions α, β and γ such that {a mathematical formula}c3 or {a mathematical formula}c4 is satisfied and{a mathematical formula} which completes the proof. □
