    Relations of epistemic proximity for belief change.
   </title>
   <abstract>
    Relations of epistemic proximity are closely related to relations of epistemic entrenchment, but contrary to the latter they do not refer to sentences but to belief patterns that are expressed with a metalinguistic belief predicate B. Hence ¬Bp≻B¬q means that disbelief in p is more close at hand (obtainable with less far-reaching changes in belief) than belief in not-q. The logic of epistemic proximity is investigated, and it is used to construct a uniform operation of belief change that has the standard operations as special cases, specified with success conditions such as Bp for revision and {¬Bp1,…,¬Bpn} for multiple contraction. Standard entrenchment relations are obtained by defining p to be less entrenched than q if and only if ¬Bp≻¬Bq.

      Introduction
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      The literature on belief revision has a strong focus on two types of belief change, namely the removal of a sentence from the agent's set of beliefs (contraction) and the addition of a sentence to that set (revision or expansion).{sup:1} Some other types of operations have also been introduced, such as the simultaneous removal of several sentences (multiple contraction) and the simultaneous addition of several sentences (multiple revision) (Hansson [5]). The various types of belief change operations are distinguished by their success conditions. In revision, the success condition is that a given sentence p should be believed, in contraction that a given sentence p should not be believed, in multiple contraction that none of a given set of sentences should be believed, etc.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In Hansson [6] a unified approach to success conditions for belief change was introduced. It is based on a metalinguistic belief operator {a mathematical formula}B that takes elements of the object language as arguments. For any sentence p in the object language, {a mathematical formula}Bp signifies that p is believed. A belief descriptor (henceforth: descriptor) is a set of molecular combinations of such {a mathematical formula}B-sentences, for instance {a mathematical formula}{¬Bp,¬B¬p} means that neither p nor its negation is believed and {a mathematical formula}{Bp∨Bq} that either p or q is believed. With this notation, a wide variety of belief change operations can be subsumed under a unified operator ∘. Then {a mathematical formula}K∘{Bp} corresponds to revision by the sentence p, {a mathematical formula}K∘{¬Bp} to contraction of the sentence p, {a mathematical formula}K∘{Bp∨B¬p} to making up one's mind about p, etc.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The standard approach to belief revision relies heavily on set-theoretical intersection. The approach can be described as a two-step select-and-intersect method. Operations of change take place in two steps. In the first step several belief sets (logically closed sets) are selected, all of which satisfy the success criterion for the operation. Then the intersection of those sets is formed, and is taken to be the outcome of the operation. (In the original AGM model for contraction, the sets selected in the first step are maximal subsets of the original belief set not containing the sentence to be removed. In the so-called sphere model of revision, the sets selected in the first step are possible worlds that contain the sentence to be added.)
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The select-and-intersect method has the obvious advantage of providing an elegant solution to ties. When we hesitate between two or more potential outcomes, then we use their intersection, i.e. the part that they have in common, as the output. However, this method also has two major disadvantages. First, as explained by Sandqvist [9], the property of being an optimal potential outcome is not necessarily preserved under intersection. Secondly, and in a sense more fundamentally, the fact that a success condition holds for all members of a collection of sets does not always imply that their intersection also satisfies this condition. True, the success conditions of ordinary contraction and revision ({a mathematical formula}{¬Bp} respectively {a mathematical formula}{Bp}) are intersection-resistant in this sense, but there are other success conditions of interest in artificial intelligence that can be lost in intersection. This applies for instance to the two success conditions {a mathematical formula}{Bp∨Bq} and {a mathematical formula}{Bp∨B¬p}. The latter is of particular interest for artificial intelligence since it corresponds to the practically important belief change operation of making up one's mind. Consider two consistent belief sets {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X2 such that {a mathematical formula}p∈X1 and {a mathematical formula}¬p∈X2. Although both {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X2 satisfy the said success condition, {a mathematical formula}X1∩X2 does not.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In order to account for belief change operations that are not intersection-resistant we will have to give up the select-and-intersect method. It can be replaced by a select-direct method in which a selection function operates directly on the set of potential outcomes, and selects exactly one of them to be the outcome. Then intersection-resistance becomes irrelevant, and at the same time the problem pointed out by Sandqvist is solved. But obviously, for this to work the selection function will have to be mono-selective, i.e. always deliver exactly one belief set as outcome when presented with a non-empty set of belief sets as input.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The investigation of the select-direct method, as applied to operations with descriptors as inputs, was begun in Hansson [6], where the following operation was introduced:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 1">
      (See Hansson [6].) An operation ∘ on a belief set K is a relational descriptor revision if and only if there is a set {a mathematical formula}X of belief sets with {a mathematical formula}K∈X (its outcome set),{sup:2} and a relation ≦ on {a mathematical formula}X, such that (i) {a mathematical formula}K≦X for all {a mathematical formula}X∈X, and (ii) for all descriptors Ψ: {a mathematical formula}K∘Ψ is the unique ≦-minimal element of {a mathematical formula}X that satisfies Ψ, unless Ψ is unsatisfiable within {a mathematical formula}X, in which case {a mathematical formula}K∘Ψ=K.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      It was shown in Hansson [6] that the conditions of this definition can only be satisfied if ≦ is a total ordering{sup:3} that satisfies the somewhat technical property descriptor-wellfoundedness, according to which it holds for all descriptors Ψ that if some element in the domain of ≦ satisfies Ψ, then there is some ≦-minimal element that does so. Furthermore, it was shown that the operations introduced in Definition 1 are axiomatically characterized by the following properties: ({a mathematical formula}K⊩Ψ means that K satisfies Ψ and {a mathematical formula}Ψ⊩Ξ that all belief sets satisfying Ψ also satisfy Ξ. The corresponding equivalence relation is written ⊣.)
     </paragraph>
     <list>
      <list-item>
       If {a mathematical formula}Ψ⊣Ψ′ then {a mathematical formula}K∘Ψ=K∘Ψ′ (extensionality)

       If {a mathematical formula}K∘Ψ⊩Ξ then {a mathematical formula}K∘Ψ=K∘(Ψ∪Ξ) (cumulativity)
      </list-item>
     </list>
     <paragraph>
      One of the most important results in the belief revision literature is the equivalence between on the one hand the original AGM framework (Alchourrón et al. [1]) that employs orderings on sets of sentences and on the other hand an approach employing relations on sentences, called relations of epistemic entrenchment (Gärdenfors [3], Gärdenfors and Makinson [4]). Intuitively, {a mathematical formula}p&lt;q (“p is less entrenched than q”) means that in a contraction, if we can choose between giving up p and giving up q, then we will opt for the former. If the entrenchment relation satisfies certain conditions (listed in Section 5), then an operator of contraction can be constructed from it that will satisfy the full set of AGM postulates for contraction. Conversely, every operator that satisfies these postulates can be constructed from an entrenchment relation.{sup:4} Obviously, in the context of descriptor revision we can talk of entrenchment as a relation not between two sentences p and q to be removed but between two descriptors {a mathematical formula}{¬Bp} and {a mathematical formula}{¬Bq}. Instead of saying that p is less entrenched than q we can then say that the agent is more inclined to have a belief state satisfying {a mathematical formula}{¬Bp} than one that satisfies {a mathematical formula}{¬Bq}. This reformulation gives rise to the question whether that relation can be meaningfully extended to all descriptors, not only those of the form {a mathematical formula}{¬Bp}. It is the purpose of the present contribution to show that this can indeed be done. The generalized relation on descriptors will be called a relation of epistemic proximity.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      After some formal preliminaries have been provided in Section 2, relations of epistemic proximity will be formally introduced in Section 3. For any two descriptors Ψ and Ξ we will say that Ψ is at least as epistemically proximal as Ξ (written: {a mathematical formula}Ψ⪰Ξ) if and only if the subject is at least as disposed to perform a change in the belief system resulting in assent to Ψ as one resulting in assent to Ξ. It will be shown that operators based on such relations are essentially interchangeable with operators constructed as in Definition 1. Section 4 is devoted to the special case in which epistemic proximity is applied only to descriptors of the form {a mathematical formula}{Bp}. It can then be replaced by a relation on sentences to be called the relation of believability. In Section 5 we will apply epistemic proximity to descriptors of the form {a mathematical formula}{¬Bp}. It can then be replaced by a relation on sentences that has all the standard properties of epistemic entrenchment. Some general conclusions are drawn in Section 6. All formal proofs are deferred to Appendix A.

      Sentences in the object language {a mathematical formula}L will be denoted by lower-case letters (p, q …) and sets of such sentences by upper-case letters ({a mathematical formula}A,B…). The usual truth-functional operations are denoted {a mathematical formula}¬,&amp;,∨,→, and ↔. ⊤ is a tautology and ⊥ a contradiction. The consequence operator Cn for {a mathematical formula}L expresses a supraclassical and compact logic satisfying the deduction property ({a mathematical formula}q∈Cn(A∪{p}) if and only if {a mathematical formula}p→q∈Cn(A)). {a mathematical formula}X⊢p is an alternative notation for {a mathematical formula}p∈Cn(X). A belief set is a set X of sentences such that {a mathematical formula}X=Cn(X). We use K to denote a consistent belief set.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      An atomic belief descriptor is a sentence {a mathematical formula}Bp with {a mathematical formula}p∈L. The symbol {a mathematical formula}B is not part of the object language {a mathematical formula}L in which the agent's beliefs are expressed. A molecular belief descriptor is a truth-functional combination of atomic descriptors. A composite belief descriptor (in short: descriptor; denoted by upper-case Greek letters {a mathematical formula}Ψ,Ξ…) is a set of molecular descriptors. Descriptors may be infinite. {an inline-figure} (descriptor falsum) denotes {a mathematical formula}{Bp,¬Bp} for an arbitrary p.

     <paragraph>
      A belief set K satisfies a composite descriptor Ψ if and only if it satisfies all its elements. A descriptor is satisfiable within a set of belief sets if and only if it is satisfied by at least one of its elements. The symbols ⊩ and ⊣ denote relations of satisfaction, as indicated in Section 1. Furthermore:

      A descriptor Ψ is maxispecified (maximally specified) if and only if there is exactly one belief set Y in {a mathematical formula}℘(L) such that {a mathematical formula}Y⊩Ψ. It is then a maxispecified descriptor for Y.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      There are many (equivalent) maxispecified descriptors for each belief set. For instance, if {a mathematical formula}X=Cn({q}) then both {a mathematical formula}{Bq}∪{¬Bp|p∉X} and {a mathematical formula}{Bp|p∈X}∪{¬Bp|p∉X} are maxispecified descriptors for X. For convenience, one of the maxispecified descriptors for a belief set X will be denoted as follows:

      Epistemic proximity
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      The relation ⪰ of epistemic proximity was introduced informally in Section 1. Its strict part is denoted ≻ and its symmetric part ≃. We will assume that it has the following five properties:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 5">
      A relation ⪰ on descriptors is a relation of epistemic proximity if and only if it satisfies:

     <paragraph>
      Contrary to the standard definition of epistemic entrenchment (Gärdenfors [3]; Gärdenfors and Makinson [4]), Definition 5 does not mention the belief set to which the relation is associated. However, it can be retrieved as the belief set specified by the maxispecified descriptor {a mathematical formula}⋃{Ψ|Ψ≃B⊤}.{sup:5}
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The following observation reports two important properties of ⪰ that follow from the ones already given.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Observation 1">
      Let ⪰ be a relation on descriptors.(1) If ⪰ satisfies transitivity and counter-dominance, then it satisfies:If{a mathematical formula}Ψ⊣Ψ′and{a mathematical formula}Ξ⊣Ξ′, then{a mathematical formula}Ψ⪰Ξif and only if{a mathematical formula}Ψ′⪰Ξ′(intersubstitutivity).(2) If ⪰ satisfies transitivity, counter-dominance, coupling, and amplification, then it satisfies:{a mathematical formula}Ψ⪰Ξor{a mathematical formula}Ξ⪰Ψ(completeness).
     </paragraph>

     <paragraph label="Definition 6">
      Let ⪰ be a relation on descriptors and let Ψ be an element of its domain.

If {a mathematical formula}Ψ⊮{an inline-figure} then the maximal amplification of Ψ is the descriptor {a mathematical formula}Ψˆ such that {a mathematical formula}Ψˆ={β(p)|p∈L}.

     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      We are now going to show that relations of epistemic proximity with these properties are interchangeable with the belief set orderings introduced in Definition 1. There is a one-to-one relationship between the two types of orderings, and also a one-to-one relationship between each of them and operators (∘) of descriptor revision. These relationships can be expressed with a set of transformation functions (Fig. 1). The terminology is based on the abbreviations b for relations on belief sets and d for relations on descriptors. Thus {a mathematical formula}tdb takes us from a relation (of epistemic proximity) on descriptors to a relation on belief sets, and {a mathematical formula}t∘d from an operator of change to a relation on descriptors.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 7">

     <paragraph>
      The interchangeability referred to above is established in the following two theorems:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Theorem 1">
      Let ≦ be a total and descriptor-wellfounded relation on a set of belief sets. Then:(1){a mathematical formula}tbd(≦)is a relation on descriptors that satisfies transitivity, counter-dominance, coupling, amplification, and absurdity avoidance,(2){a mathematical formula}tdb(tbd(≦))=≦,(3){a mathematical formula}td∘(tbd(≦))=tb∘(≦),(4){a mathematical formula}t∘b(tb∘(≦))=≦, and(5){a mathematical formula}t∘d(tb∘(≦))=tbd(≦).
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Theorem 2">
      Let ⪰ be a relation on descriptors that satisfies transitivity, counter-dominance, coupling, amplification, and absurdity avoidance. Then:(1){a mathematical formula}tdb(⪰)is a complete, transitive, antisymmetric and descriptor-wellfounded relation on a set of belief sets,(2){a mathematical formula}tbd(tdb(⪰))=⪰,(3){a mathematical formula}tb∘(tdb(⪰))=td∘(⪰),(4){a mathematical formula}t∘d(td∘(⪰))=⪰, and(5){a mathematical formula}t∘b(td∘(⪰))=tdb(⪰).

     <paragraph>
      In combination, Theorem 1, Theorem 2 show that the relationship between relational descriptor revision (following {a mathematical formula}tb∘) and descriptor revision based on epistemic proximity (following {a mathematical formula}td∘) is essentially the same as that in AGM between transitively relational partial meet contraction and contraction based on epistemic entrenchment: these are different constructions that yield exactly the same classes of operations of change.

      Believability relations for sentential (semi)revision
     </section-title>
     <paragraph>
      By “belief revision” is usually meant an operation (denoted ⁎) in which a single sentence is incorporated into the belief set, and consistency is upheld if possible (Alchourrón et al. [1]). To avoid ambiguity, the term “sentential revision” will be used here for this type of operation. By a “semi-revision” is meant a similar (sentential) relation that does not satisfy the success postulate, {a mathematical formula}p∈K⁎p for all p. The present framework can easily be restricted to these sentential operations. For that purpose we can replace ∘ by an operation with sentences as inputs, ⪰ by a relation on sentences, and ≦ by a relation whose domain only contains those belief sets that are the outcome of some sentential revision:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 8">
      Let K be a belief set, ∘ a descriptor revision on K, {a mathematical formula}X its outcome set, ≦ (with the strict part &lt;) a total ordering on {a mathematical formula}X with K as its minimal element, and ⪰ a relation of epistemic proximity. Then:(1) The sentential operation ⁎ such that {a mathematical formula}K⁎p=K∘{Bp} for all p is the sentential semirevision on K that is derived from ∘. It is a sentential revision if and only if the domain of ≦ contains {a mathematical formula}Cn({⊥}).(2) The total belief set ordering {a mathematical formula}≦⋆ such that {a mathematical formula}Z≦⋆W if and only if {a mathematical formula}Z≦W, {a mathematical formula}Z⊈⋃{Y∈X|Y&lt;Z} and {a mathematical formula}W⊈⋃{Y∈X|Y&lt;W} is the additive restriction of ≦. Furthermore, ≦ is additively restricted if and only if it is its own additive restriction.(3) The relation {a mathematical formula}⪰⋆ on sentences, such that {a mathematical formula}p⪰⋆q iff {a mathematical formula}Bp⪰Bq is the believability relation that is based on ⪰.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The additive restriction {a mathematical formula}≦⋆ of ≦ is the restriction of ≦ to those elements of its domain that can be obtained as the outcome of revising K by some descriptor of the form {a mathematical formula}Bp. The strict part of {a mathematical formula}≦⋆ is denoted {a mathematical formula}&lt;⋆. The strict part of {a mathematical formula}⪰⋆ is denoted {a mathematical formula}≻⋆ and its symmetrical part {a mathematical formula}≃⋆. See Hansson [6] for an axiomatic characterization of the form of sentential revision introduced in part 1 of Definition 8.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      It is straight-forwardly verified that the derived semirevision ⁎ satisfies the success postulate {a mathematical formula}(p∈K⁎p) if and only if it is a revision according to part 1 of the definition.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Not surprisingly, each of these three restrictions involves a loss of information:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Observation 3">
      (1) Let ∘ be a descriptor revision on the belief set K and ⁎ its derived semirevision operator. It does not hold in general that ∘ is derivable from ⁎.(2) Let ≦ be a total belief set ordering and{a mathematical formula}≦⋆its additive restriction. It does not hold in general that ≦ is derivable from{a mathematical formula}≦⋆.(3) Let ⪰ be a proximity relation and{a mathematical formula}⪰⋆the believability relation that is based on it. It does not hold in general that ⪰ is derivable from{a mathematical formula}⪰⋆.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The following three observations explore the relationships among the three restrictions introduced in Definition 8.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Observation 4">
      Let K be a belief set, ≦ a total and descriptor-wellfounded belief set ordering with K as its minimal element, and{a mathematical formula}∘=tb∘(≦). Furthermore, let{a mathematical formula}≦⋆be the additive restriction of ≦ and ⁎ the sentential semirevision that is derived from ∘. Then:(1) ⁎ is derivable from{a mathematical formula}≦⋆as follows: For all p, (i) if p is satisfiable within the domain of{a mathematical formula}≦⋆, then{a mathematical formula}K⁎pis the unique{a mathematical formula}≦⋆-minimal p-containing element of the domain of{a mathematical formula}≦⋆, and (ii) otherwise,{a mathematical formula}K⁎p=K.(2){a mathematical formula}≦⋆is not derivable from ⁎.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Observation 5">
      Let K be a belief set, ≦ a total and descriptor-wellfounded belief set ordering with K as its minimal element,{a mathematical formula}∘=tb∘(≦)and{a mathematical formula}⪰=tbd(≦). Furthermore, let ⁎ be the sentential semirevision that is derived from ∘ and{a mathematical formula}⪰⋆the believability relation that is based on ⪰. Then:(1) ⁎ is not derivable from{a mathematical formula}⪰⋆.(2){a mathematical formula}⪰⋆is not derivable from ⁎.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Observation 6">

Then:(1){a mathematical formula}⪰⋆is derivable from{a mathematical formula}≦⋆as follows:{a mathematical formula}p⪰⋆qif and only if either (i) p and q are both satisfiable within the domain of{a mathematical formula}≦⋆, and the first p-containing belief set does not come after the first q-containing one, or (ii) q is unsatisfiable within the domain of{a mathematical formula}≦⋆.(2) It does not hold in general that{a mathematical formula}≦⋆is derivable from{a mathematical formula}⪰⋆.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      These results are summarized in Fig. 2. As can be seen there, the interdefinabilities illustrated in Fig. 1 are not retained after the restriction. For a given belief set ordering ≦, let {a mathematical formula}≦⋆ be its additive restriction, ⁎ the sentential revision it gives rise to and {a mathematical formula}⪰⋆ the believability relation that it gives rise to. Then we can derive ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}⪰⋆ from {a mathematical formula}≦⋆, but in neither case is derivation in the other direction possible. Furthermore, neither ⁎ nor {a mathematical formula}⪰⋆ can be derived from the other.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Part 1 of Observation 5 and part 2 of Observation 6 may both seem counterintuitive, but they can both easily be verified by comparing the two total belief set orderings ≦ and {a mathematical formula}≦′ that are exhaustively characterized by {a mathematical formula}Cn({p})≦Cn({p&amp;q})≦Cn({⊥}) respectively {a mathematical formula}Cn({p})≦′Cn({p&amp;q}). They give rise to the same believability relation but differ in that {a mathematical formula}K⁎¬q=Cn({⊥}) but {a mathematical formula}K⁎′¬q=K.

      Revocation, contraction, and entrenchment

     <paragraph>
      Just as we restricted our attention to descriptors of the form {a mathematical formula}Bp we can restrict it to descriptors of the form {a mathematical formula}¬Bp. Operations with a success condition of that form have been called operations of revocation (Hansson [6]). Similarly, operations with success conditions of the form {a mathematical formula}{¬Bp1,…,¬Bpn} can be called operations of multiple revocation. These are more general categories than operations of (multiple) contraction, since the latter are required to satisfy the inclusion postulate, {a mathematical formula}K−̣p⊆K (for multiple contraction {a mathematical formula}K−̣A⊆K). The following definition introduces the corresponding restrictions on belief set orderings and orderings of epistemic proximity:
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph label="Definition 9">
      Let K be a belief set, ∘ a descriptor revision on K, {a mathematical formula}X its outcome set, ≦ (with the strict part &lt;) a total ordering of {a mathematical formula}X with K as its minimal element, and ⪰ a relation of epistemic proximity. Then:(1) The sentential operation −̣ such that {a mathematical formula}K−̣p=K∘¬Bp for all p is the revocation on K that is derived from ∘. It is a contraction if and only if both {a mathematical formula}⋃{K−̣p|p∈L}⊆K and {a mathematical formula}⋂{K−̣p|p∈L}=Cn(∅).(2) The total belief set ordering {a mathematical formula}≦− such that {a mathematical formula}Z≦−W if and only if {a mathematical formula}Z≦W, {a mathematical formula}⋂{Y∈X|Y&lt;Z}⊈Z and {a mathematical formula}⋂{Y∈X|Y&lt;W}⊈W is the subtractive restriction of ≦. Furthermore, ≦ is subtractively restricted if and only if it is its own subtractive restriction. The strict part of {a mathematical formula}≦− is denoted {a mathematical formula}&lt;−.(3) The relation {an inline-figure} on sentences such that {a mathematical formula}p{an inline-figure}q if and only if {a mathematical formula}¬Bp⪰¬Bq is the entrenchment relation derived from ⪰. The strict part of {an inline-figure} is denoted ⋖ and its symmetrical part {a mathematical formula}≃˙.

     <paragraph>
      Concerning part 1 of the definition it should be noted that the conditions for a revocation to be a contraction according to the above definition coincide with what is required to make it satisfy the postulates inclusion ({a mathematical formula}K−̣p⊆K) and success (if ⊬p then {a mathematical formula}K−̣p⊬p).{sup:6} Concerning part 2, the subtractive restriction {a mathematical formula}≦− of ≦ is the restriction of ≦ to those elements of its domain that can be obtained as the outcome of revising K by some descriptor of the form {a mathematical formula}¬Bp. In part 3 it is important to note that the entrenchment relation is defined not only for contraction but also for the more general operation of revocation. As the following observation shows, the entrenchment relation {an inline-figure} obtained in this way turns out to satisfy all the standard properties of epistemic entrenchment, even if the operation is a revocation and not a contraction{sup:7}:

     <paragraph label="Observation 7">
      Let ⪰ be a relation on descriptors and let{an inline-figure}be the entrenchment relation derived from it. Then:(1) If ⪰ satisfies transitivity then so does{an inline-figure}.(2) If ⪰ satisfies counter-dominance, then{an inline-figure}satisfies dominance (if{a mathematical formula}p⊢qthen{a mathematical formula}p{an inline-figure}q).(3) If ⪰ satisfies transitivity, counter-dominance, coupling, and amplification, then{an inline-figure}satisfies conjunctiveness (either{a mathematical formula}p{an inline-figure}p&amp;qor{a mathematical formula}q{an inline-figure}p&amp;q).(4) If ⪰ satisfies transitivity, counter-dominance, coupling, and amplification, then{an inline-figure}satisfies minimality ({a mathematical formula}p∉{r|⊥⋖r}if and only if{a mathematical formula}p{an inline-figure}qfor all q).(5) If ⪰ satisfies transitivity, counter-dominance, coupling, and amplification, then{an inline-figure}satisfies maximality (if{a mathematical formula}q{an inline-figure}pfor all q, then ⊢p) if and only if ⪰ satisfies: If ⊬p then{a mathematical formula}¬Bp≻{an inline-figure}.

     <paragraph>
      The definition of minimality in Observation 7 differs from the standard definition ({a mathematical formula}p∉K if and only if {a mathematical formula}p{an inline-figure}q for all q) in not mentioning the belief set K. However, K is derivable from {an inline-figure} as {a mathematical formula}{r|⊥⋖r}, and therefore it is not necessary to mention K in the axiomatization.{sup:8}

      Just as for revision, each of the three restrictions involves loss of information:

      These results are summarized in Fig. 3.

      All contraction (and revocation) operators that are obtainable as restrictions of an operator of relational descriptor revision have an entrenchment relation associated with them in the manner shown in Definition 9. But as noted above, this is a different category of operations than those that have an entrenchment relation associated to them in the usual AGM way. Therefore it should not come as a surprise that Gärdenfors' definition of contraction in terms of entrenchment cannot be used in the present framework:

      In summary, we have seen in this section that the restriction of a relation of epistemic proximity to descriptors that represent revocations (that need not be contractions) gives rise to a relation satisfying all the standard properties of epistemic entrenchment. Different belief set orderings may give rise to one and the same relation of epistemic entrenchment, and we have characterized those orderings.
