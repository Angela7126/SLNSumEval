<a href="#0" id="0">Qualitative modeling is traditionally concerned with the abstraction of numerical data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In numerical domains, partial derivatives describe the relation between the independent and dependent variable; qualitatively, they tell us the trend of the dependent variable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we address the problem of extracting qualitative relations in categorical domains.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We generalize the notion of partial derivative by defining the probabilistic discrete qualitative partial derivative (PDQ PD).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">PDQ PD is a qualitative relation between the target class c and the discrete attribute; the derivative corresponds to ordering the attribute's values, ai, by P(c|ai) in a local neighborhood of the reference point, respecting the ceteris paribus principle.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We present an algorithm for computation of PDQ PD from labeled attribute-based training data.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Machine learning algorithms can then be used to induce models that explain the influence of the attribute's values on the target class in different subspaces of the attribute space.</a>
