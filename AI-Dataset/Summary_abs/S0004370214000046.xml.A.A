<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we investigate the consequence-based algorithms that are nowadays commonly used for subsumption reasoning with description logic ontologies, presenting the following novel results.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First, we present a very general consequence-based reasoning algorithm that can be instantiated so as to capture the essential features of the known algorithms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Second, we use this algorithm to develop a novel framework for a quantitative and parametric analysis of the complexity of subsumption reasoning in description logic ontologies.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our approach is based on the notion of a decomposition—a graph-like structure that, roughly speaking, summarizes the models relevant during ontology reasoning.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We identify width and length as decomposition parameters that determine the “level” of combinatorial reasoning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We prove that, when parameterized by a decomposition, our consequence-based algorithm runs in time that is fixed-parameter tractable in width and length.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Third, we briefly discuss how length and width characterize the behavior of tableau algorithms.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Fourth, we show that the width and length of existing ontologies are reasonably small, which, we believe, explains the good performance of consequence-based algorithms in practice.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We thus obtain a sound foundation for a practical implementation of ontology reasoners, as well as a way to analyze the reasoners' performance.</a>
