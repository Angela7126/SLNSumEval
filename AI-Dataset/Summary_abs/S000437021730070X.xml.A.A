<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we propose a progression semantics for first-order normal logic programs, and show that it is equivalent to the well-known stable model (answer set) semantics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The progressional definition sheds new insights into Answer Set Programming (ASP), for instance, its relationships to Datalog, First-Order Logic (FOL) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As an example, we extend the notion of boundedness in Datalog for ASP, and show that it coincides with the notions of recursion-freeness and loop-freeness under program equivalence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition, we prove that boundedness precisely captures first-order definability for normal logic programs on arbitrary structures.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, we show that the progressional definition suggests an alternative translation from ASP to SMT, which yields a new way of implementing first-order ASP.</a>
