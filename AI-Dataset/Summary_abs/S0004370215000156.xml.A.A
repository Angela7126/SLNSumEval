<a href="#0" id="0">The paper works with a logic which has the expressiveness to quantify over strategies of bounded length.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The semantics of the logic is based on systems with multiple agents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Agents have incomplete information about the underlying system state and their strategies are based on perfect recall memory over observations and local actions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The computational complexity of model checking is shown to be PSPACE-complete.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We give two BDD-based model checking algorithms.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The algorithms are implemented in a model checker and experimental results are reported to show their applications.</a>
