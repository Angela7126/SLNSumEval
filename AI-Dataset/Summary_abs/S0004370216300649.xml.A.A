<a href="#0" id="0">Nowadays, modern SAT solvers are able to efficiently solve many industrial, or real-world, SAT instances.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, the process of development and testing of new SAT solving techniques is conditioned to the finite and reduced number of known industrial benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, new models of random SAT instances generation that capture realistically the features of real-world problems can be beneficial to the SAT community.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In many works, the structure of industrial instances has been analyzed representing them as graphs and studying some of their properties, like modularity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this work, we use the notion of modularity to define a new model of generation of random SAT instances with community structure, called Community Attachment.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For high values of modularity (i.e., clear community structure), we realistically model pseudo-industrial random SAT formulas.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This model also generates SAT instances very similar to classical random formulas using a low value of modularity.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also prove that the phase transition point, if exists, is independent on the modularity.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We evaluate the adequacy of this model to real industrial SAT problems in terms of SAT solvers performance, and show that modern solvers do actually exploit this community structure.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we use this generator to observe the connections between the modularity of the instance and some components of the solver, such as the variable branching heuristics or the clause learning mechanism.</a>
