<a href="#0" id="0">We present a computational framework for conceptual blending, a concept invention method that is advocated in cognitive science as a fundamental and uniquely human engine for creative thinking.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our framework treats a crucial part of the blending process, namely the generalisation of input concepts, as a search problem that is solved by means of modern answer set programming methods to find commonalities among input concepts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also address the problem of pruning the space of possible blends by introducing metrics that capture most of the so-called optimality principles, described in the cognitive science literature as guidelines to produce meaningful and serendipitous blends.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how our system invents novel concepts and theories in domains where creativity is crucial, namely mathematics and music.</a>
