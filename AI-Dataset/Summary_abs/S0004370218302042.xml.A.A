<a href="#0" id="0">Boolean games allow us to succinctly represent strategic games with binary payoffs in the case where the players' preferences have a structure readily expressible in propositional logic.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since their introduction, the computational aspects of Boolean games have been of interest to the multiagent community, but so far the focus has been exclusively on pure strategy equilibria.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper we consider the complexity of problems involving mixed strategy equilibria, such as the existence of an equilibrium satisfying a given payoff constraint.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The results are obtained by the observation that a mixed strategy can hold enough information to encode the computation history of an exponential time Turing machine.</a>
