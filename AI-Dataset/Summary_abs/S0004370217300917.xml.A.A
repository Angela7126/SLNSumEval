<a href="#0" id="0">Knorr et al. (2011) [9] formulated a three-valued formalism for the logic of Minimal Knowledge and Negation as Failure (MKNF), and proposed a well-founded semantics for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The main results state that if a hybrid MKNF knowledge base has a three-valued MKNF model, its well-founded MKNF model exists, which is unique and can be computed by an alternating fixpoint construction.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, we show that these claims are erroneous.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The goal of this paper is two-fold.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, we provide insight into why these claims fail to hold.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This leads to a classification of hybrid MKNF knowledge bases into a hierarchy of four classes, of which the smallest one is what works for the well-founded semantics proposed by Knorr et al. After that, we characterize three-valued MKNF models into what we call stable partitions, which are similar to partial stable models in logic programming.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The intuitive notion of stable partitions allows us to discover a new proof-theoretic method to determine whether a three-valued MKNF model exists for a given hybrid MKNF knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We can guess partial partitions and verify their stability by computing alternating fixpoints and by performing a consistency check.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This algorithm can be applied to compute all three-valued MKNF models, as well as all two-valued ones originally formulated by Motik and Rosati for query answering.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As a result, our work provides a uniform characterization of well-founded, two-valued, and all three-valued MKNF models, in terms of stable partitions and the alternating fixpoint construction.</a>
