<a href="#0" id="0">We present the hierarchical semi-Markov conditional random field (HSCRF), a generalisation of linear-chain conditional random fields to model deep nested Markov processes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is parameterised as a conditional log-linear model and has polynomial time algorithms for learning and inference.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We derive algorithms for partially-supervised learning and constrained inference.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We develop numerical scaling procedures that handle the overflow problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that when depth is two, the HSCRF can be reduced to the semi-Markov conditional random fields.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, we demonstrate the HSCRF on two applications: (i) recognising human activities of daily living (ADLs) from indoor surveillance cameras, and (ii) noun-phrase chunking.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The HSCRF is capable of learning rich hierarchical models with reasonable accuracy in both fully and partially observed data cases.</a>
