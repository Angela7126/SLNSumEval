<a href="#0" id="0">A long-standing goal of AI is to enable robots to plan in the face of uncertain and incomplete information, and to handle task failure intelligently.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This paper shows how to achieve this.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There are two central ideas.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The first idea is to organize the robot's knowledge into three layers: instance knowledge at the bottom, commonsense knowledge above that, and diagnostic knowledge on top.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Knowledge in a layer above can be used to modify knowledge in the layer(s) below.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The second idea is that the robot should represent not just how its actions change the world, but also what it knows or believes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">There are two types of knowledge effects the robot's actions can have: epistemic effects (I believe X because I saw it) and assumptions (I'll assume X to be true).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By combining the knowledge layers with the models of knowledge effects, we can simultaneously solve several problems in robotics: (i) task planning and execution under uncertainty; (ii) task planning and execution in open worlds; (iii) explaining task failure; (iv) verifying those explanations.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The paper describes how the ideas are implemented in a three-layer architecture on a mobile robot platform.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The robot implementation was evaluated in five different experiments on object search, mapping, and room categorization.</a>
