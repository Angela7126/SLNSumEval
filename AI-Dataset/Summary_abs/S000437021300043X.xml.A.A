<a href="#0" id="0">The Dempster–Shafer theory of belief functions is an important approach to deal with uncertainty in AI.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the theory, belief functions are defined on Boolean algebras of events.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In many applications of belief functions in real world problems, however, the objects that we manipulate is no more a Boolean algebra but a distributive lattice.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we employ Birkhoffʼs representation theorem for finite distributive lattices to extend the Dempster–Shafer theory to the setting of distributive lattices, which has a mathematical theory as attractive as in that of Boolean algebras.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, we use this more general theory to provide a framework for reasoning about belief functions in a deductive approach on non-classical formalisms which assume a setting of distributive lattices.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As an illustration of this approach, we investigate the theory of belief functions for a simple epistemic logic the first-degree-entailment fragment of relevance logic R by providing an axiomatization for reasoning about belief functions for this logic and by showing that the complexity of the satisfiability problem of a belief formula with respect to the class of the corresponding Dempster–Shafer structures is NP-complete.</a>
