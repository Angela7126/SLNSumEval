<a href="#0" id="0">Fuzzy description logics (DLs) can be used to represent and reason with vague knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This family of logical formalisms is very diverse, each member being characterized by a specific choice of constructors, axioms, and triangular norms, which are used to specify the semantics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Unfortunately, it has recently been shown that the consistency problem in many fuzzy DLs with general concept inclusion axioms is undecidable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we present a proof framework that allows us to extend these results to cover large classes of fuzzy DLs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">On the other hand, we also provide matching decidability results for most of the remaining logics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As a result, we obtain a near-universal classification of fuzzy DLs according to the decidability of their consistency problem.</a>
