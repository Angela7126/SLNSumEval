<a href="#0" id="0">Arguments in structured argumentation are usually defined as trees, and extensions as sets of such tree-based arguments with various properties depending on the particular argumentation semantics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, these arguments and extensions may have redundancies as well as circularities, which are conceptually and computationally undesirable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Focusing on the specific case of Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA), we propose novel notions of arguments and admissible/grounded extensions, both defined in terms of graphs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We show that this avoids the redundancies and circularities of standard accounts, and set out the relationship to standard tree-based arguments and admissible/grounded extensions (as sets of arguments).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also define new notions of graph-based admissible/grounded dispute derivations for ABA, for determining whether specific sentences hold under the admissible/grounded semantics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We show that these new derivations are superior with respect to standard dispute derivations in that they are complete in general, rather than solely for restricted classes of ABA frameworks.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, we present several experiments comparing the implementation of graph-based admissible/grounded dispute derivations with implementations of standard dispute derivations, suggesting that the graph-based approach is computationally advantageous.</a>
