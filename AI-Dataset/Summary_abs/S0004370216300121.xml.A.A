<a href="#0" id="0">A binary CSP instance satisfying the broken-triangle property (BTP) can be solved in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Unfortunately, in practice, few instances satisfy the BTP.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that a local version of the BTP allows the merging of domain values in arbitrary instances of binary CSP, thus providing a novel polynomial-time reduction operation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Extensive experimental trials on benchmark instances demonstrate a significant decrease in instance size for certain classes of problems.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that BTP-merging can be generalised to instances with constraints of arbitrary arity and we investigate the theoretical relationship with resolution in SAT.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A directional version of general-arity BTP-merging then allows us to extend the BTP tractable class previously defined only for binary CSP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We investigate the complexity of several related problems including the recognition problem for the general-arity BTP class when the variable order is unknown, finding an optimal order in which to apply BTP merges and detecting BTP-merges in the presence of global constraints such as AllDifferent.</a>
