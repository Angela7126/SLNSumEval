<a href="#0" id="0">Graph aggregation is the process of computing a single output graph that constitutes a good compromise between several input graphs, each provided by a different source.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">One needs to perform graph aggregation in a wide variety of situations, e.g., when applying a voting rule (graphs as preference orders), when consolidating conflicting views regarding the relationships between arguments in a debate (graphs as abstract argumentation frameworks), or when computing a consensus between several alternative clusterings of a given dataset (graphs as equivalence relations).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for graph aggregation grounded in social choice theory.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our focus is on understanding which properties shared by the individual input graphs will transfer to the output graph returned by a given aggregation rule.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We consider both common properties of graphs, such as transitivity and reflexivity, and arbitrary properties expressible in certain fragments of modal logic.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our results establish several connections between the types of properties preserved under aggregation and the choice-theoretic axioms satisfied by the rules used.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The most important of these results is a powerful impossibility theorem that generalises Arrow's seminal result for the aggregation of preference orders to a large collection of different types of graphs.</a>
