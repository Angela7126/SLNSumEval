<a href="#0" id="0">Knowledge compilation is a process of adding more information to a knowledge base in order to make it easier to deduce facts from the compiled base than from the original one.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">One type of knowledge compilation occurs when the knowledge in question is represented by a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The goal of knowledge compilation in this case is to add clauses to the input CNF until a logically equivalent propagation complete CNF is obtained.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A CNF is called propagation complete if after any partial substitution of truth values all logically entailed literals can be inferred from the resulting CNF formula by unit propagation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The key to this type of knowledge compilation is the ability to generate so-called empowering clauses.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A clause is empowering for a CNF if it is an implicate and for some partial substitution of truth values it enlarges the set of entailed literals inferable by unit propagation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this paper we study several complexity issues related to empowering implicates, propagation completeness, and its relation to resolution proofs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We show several results: (a) given a CNF and a clause it is co-NP complete to decide whether the clause is an empowering implicate of the CNF, (b) given a CNF it is NP-complete to decide whether there exists an empowering implicate for it and thus it is co-NP complete to decide whether a CNF is propagation complete, and (c) there exist CNFs to which an exponential number of clauses must be added to make them propagation complete.</a>
