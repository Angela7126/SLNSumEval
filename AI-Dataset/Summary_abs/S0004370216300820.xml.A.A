<a href="#0" id="0">Owing to the need for a deep understanding of linguistic items, semantic representation is considered to be one of the fundamental components of several applications in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a result, semantic representation has been one of the prominent research areas in lexical semantics over the past decades.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, due mainly to the lack of large sense-annotated corpora, most existing representation techniques are limited to the lexical level and thus cannot be effectively applied to individual word senses.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper we put forward a novel multilingual vector representation, called Nasari, which not only enables accurate representation of word senses in different languages, but it also provides two main advantages over existing approaches: (1) high coverage, including both concepts and named entities, (2) comparability across languages and linguistic levels (i.e., words, senses and concepts), thanks to the representation of linguistic items in a single unified semantic space and in a joint embedded space, respectively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, our representations are flexible, can be applied to multiple applications and are freely available at http://lcl.uniroma1.it/nasari/.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As evaluation benchmark, we opted for four different tasks, namely, word similarity, sense clustering, domain labeling, and Word Sense Disambiguation, for each of which we report state-of-the-art performance on several standard datasets across different languages.</a>
