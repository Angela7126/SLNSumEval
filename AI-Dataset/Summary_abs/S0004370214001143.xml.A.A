<a href="#0" id="0">We propose using computational teaching algorithms to improve human teaching for machine learners.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We investigate example sequences produced naturally by human teachers and find that humans often do not spontaneously generate optimal teaching sequences for arbitrary machine learners.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To elicit better teaching, we propose giving humans teaching guidance, which are instructions on how to teach, derived from computational teaching algorithms or heuristics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We present experimental results demonstrating that teaching guidance substantially improves human teaching in three different problem domains.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This provides promising evidence that human intelligence and flexibility can be leveraged to achieve better sample efficiency when input data to a learning system comes from a human teacher.</a>
