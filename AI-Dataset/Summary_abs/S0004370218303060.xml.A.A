<a href="#0" id="0">Ontology-based data integration systems allow users to effectively access data sitting in multiple sources by means of queries over a global schema described by an ontology.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In practice, data sources often contain sensitive information that the data owners want to keep inaccessible to users.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our aim in this paper is to lay the logical foundations of information disclosure in ontology-based data integration.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our focus is on the semantic requirements that a data integration system should satisfy before it is made available to users for querying, as well as on the computational complexity of checking whether such requirements are fulfilled.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, we formalise and study the problem of determining whether a given data integration system discloses a source query to an attacker.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We consider disclosure on a particular dataset, and also whether a schema admits a dataset on which disclosure occurs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We provide matching lower and upper complexity bounds on disclosure analysis, in the process introducing a number of techniques for analysing logical privacy issues in ontology-based data integration.</a>
