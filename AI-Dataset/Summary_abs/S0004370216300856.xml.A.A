<a href="#0" id="0">Several competing human behavior models have been proposed to model boundedly rational adversaries in repeated Stackelberg Security Games (SSG).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, these existing models fail to address three main issues which are detrimental to defender performance.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, while they attempt to learn adversary behavior models from adversaries' past actions (“attacks on targets”), they fail to take into account adversaries' future adaptation based on successes or failures of these past actions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Second, existing algorithms fail to learn a reliable model of the adversary unless there exists sufficient data collected by exposing enough of the attack surface – a situation that often arises in initial rounds of the repeated SSG.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Third, current leading models have failed to include probability weighting functions, even though it is well known that human beings' weighting of probability is typically nonlinear.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To address these limitations of existing models, this article provides three main contributions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our first contribution is a new human behavior model, SHARP, which mitigates these three limitations as follows: (i) SHARP reasons based on success or failure of the adversary's past actions on exposed portions of the attack surface to model adversary adaptivity; (ii) SHARP reasons about similarity between exposed and unexposed areas of the attack surface, and also incorporates a discounting parameter to mitigate adversary's lack of exposure to enough of the attack surface; and (iii) SHARP integrates a non-linear probability weighting function to capture the adversary's true weighting of probability.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our second contribution is a first “repeated measures study” – at least in the context of SSGs – of competing human behavior models.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This study, where each experiment lasted a period of multiple weeks with individual sets of human subjects on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform, illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of different models and shows the advantages of SHARP.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Our third major contribution is to demonstrate SHARP's superiority by conducting real-world human subjects experiments at the Bukit Barisan Seletan National Park in Indonesia against wildlife security experts.</a>
