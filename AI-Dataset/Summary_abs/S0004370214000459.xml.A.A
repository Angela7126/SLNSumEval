<a href="#0" id="0">We give a solution to the succinctness problem for the size of first-order rewritings of conjunctive queries in ontology-based data access with ontology languages such as OWL 2 QL, linear Datalog± and sticky Datalog±.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show that positive existential and nonrecursive datalog rewritings, which do not use extra non-logical symbols (except for intensional predicates in the case of datalog rewritings), suffer an exponential blowup in the worst case, while first-order rewritings can grow superpolynomially unless NP⊆P/poly.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also prove that nonrecursive datalog rewritings are in general exponentially more succinct than positive existential rewritings, while first-order rewritings can be superpolynomially more succinct than positive existential rewritings.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">On the other hand, we construct polynomial-size positive existential and nonrecursive datalog rewritings under the assumption that any data instance contains two fixed constants.</a>
