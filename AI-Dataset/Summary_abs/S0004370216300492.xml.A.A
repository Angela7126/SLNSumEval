<a href="#0" id="0">We introduce a hierarchical framework for conjunctive concept combination based on conceptual spaces and random set theory.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The model has the flexibility to account for composition of concepts at various levels of complexity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that the conjunctive model includes linear combination as a special case, and that the more general model can account for non-compositional behaviours such as overextension, non-commutativity, preservation of necessity and impossibility of attributes and to some extent, attribute loss or emergence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We investigate two further aspects of human concept use, the conjunction fallacy and the ‘guppy effect’.</a>
