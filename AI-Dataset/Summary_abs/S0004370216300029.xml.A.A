<a href="#0" id="0">The answer set semantics may assign a logic program to model, due to logical contradiction or unstable negation, which is caused by cyclic dependency of an atom on its negation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While logical contradictions can be handled with traditional techniques from paraconsistent reasoning, instability requires other methods.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We consider resorting to a paracoherent semantics, in which 3-valued interpretations are used where a third truth value besides true and false expresses that an atom is believed true.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is at the basis of the semi-stable model semantics, which was defined using a program transformation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we give a model-theoretic characterization of semi-stable models, which makes the semantics more accessible.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Motivated by some anomalies of semi-stable model semantics with respect to basic epistemic properties, we propose an amendment that satisfies these properties.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The latter has both a transformational and a model-theoretic characterization that reveals it as a relaxation of equilibrium logic, the logical reconstruction of answer set semantics, and is thus called the semi-equilibrium model semantics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We consider refinements of this semantics to respect modularity in the rules, based on splitting sets, the major tool for modularity in modeling and evaluating answer set programs.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In that, we single out classes of canonical models that are amenable for customary bottom-up evaluation of answer set programs, with an option to switch to a paracoherent mode when lack of an answer set is detected.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A complexity analysis of major reasoning tasks shows that semi-equilibrium models are harder than answer sets (i.e., equilibrium models), due to a global minimization step for keeping the gap between true and believed true atoms as small as possible.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Our results contribute to the logical foundations of paracoherent answer set programming, which gains increasing importance in inconsistency management, and at the same time provide a basis for algorithm development and integration into answer set solvers.</a>
