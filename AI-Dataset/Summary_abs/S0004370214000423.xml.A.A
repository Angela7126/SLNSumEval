<a href="#0" id="0">The problem of minimising the number of distinct values among a set of variables subject to difference constraints occurs in many real-life contexts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is the case of the Shift Minimisation Personnel Task Scheduling Problem, introduced by Krishnamoorthy et al., which is used as a case study all along this paper.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Constraint-Programming enables to formulate this problem easily, through several AllDifferent constraints and a single AtMostNValue constraint.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, the independence of these constraints results in a poor lower bounding, hence a difficulty to prove optimality.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This paper introduces a formalism to describe a family of propagators for AtMostNValue.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In particular, we provide simple but significant improvement of the state-of-the-art AtMostNValue propagator of Bessi√®re et al., to filter the conjunction of an AtMostNValue constraint and disequalities.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In addition, we provide an original search strategy which relies on constraint reification.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Extensive experiments show that our contribution significantly improves a straightforward model, so that it competes with the best known approaches from Operational Research.</a>
