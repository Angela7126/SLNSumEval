<a href="#0" id="0">We survey recent approaches to inconsistency measurement in propositional logic and provide a comparative analysis in terms of their expressivity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For that, we introduce four different expressivity characteristics that quantitatively assess the number of different knowledge bases that a measure can distinguish.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our approach aims at complementing ongoing discussions on rationality postulates for inconsistency measures by considering expressivity as a desirable property.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We evaluate 16 different measures on the proposed characteristics and conclude that the distance-based measure IdalalÎ£ from Grant and Hunter (2013) [8] and the proof-based measure IPm from Jabbour and Raddaoui (2013) [16] have maximal expressivity along all considered characteristics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In our study, we discovered several interesting relationships of inconsistency measurement to e.g. set theory and Boolean functions and we also report these findings.</a>
