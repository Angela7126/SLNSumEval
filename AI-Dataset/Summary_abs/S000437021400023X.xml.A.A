<a href="#0" id="0">Constraint Programming (CP) is a proven set of techniques for solving complex combinatorial problems from a range of disciplines.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The problem is specified as a set of decision variables (with finite domains) and constraints linking the variables.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Local reasoning (propagation) on the constraints is central to CP.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Many constraints have efficient constraint-specific propagation algorithms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this work, we generate custom propagators for constraints.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These custom propagators can be very efficient, even approaching (and in some cases exceeding) the efficiency of hand-optimised propagators.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given an arbitrary constraint, we show how to generate a custom propagator that establishes GAC in small polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This is done by precomputing the propagation that would be performed on every relevant subdomain.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The number of relevant subdomains, and therefore the size of the generated propagator, is potentially exponential in the number and domain size of the constrained variables.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The limiting factor of our approach is the size of the generated propagators.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We investigate symmetry as a means of reducing that size.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We exploit the symmetries of the constraint to merge symmetric parts of the generated propagator.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This extends the reach of our approach to somewhat larger constraints, with a small run-time penalty.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Our experimental results show that, compared with optimised implementations of the table constraint, our techniques can lead to an order of magnitude speedup.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Propagation is so fast that the generated propagators compare well with hand-written carefully optimised propagators for the same constraints, and the time taken to generate a propagator is more than repaid.</a>
