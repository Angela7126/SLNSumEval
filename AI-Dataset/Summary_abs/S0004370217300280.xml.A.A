<a href="#0" id="0">We consider a simple language for writing causal action theories, and postulate several properties for the state transition models of these theories.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We then consider some possible embeddings of these causal action theories in some other action formalisms, and their implementations in logic programs with answer set semantics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, we propose to consider what we call permissible translations from these causal action theories to logic programs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We identify two sets of properties, and prove that for each set, there is only one permissible translation, under strong equivalence, that can satisfy all properties in the set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also show that these two sets of conditions are minimal in that removing any condition from each of them will result in multiple permissible mappings.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, as it turns out, for one set, the unique permissible translation is essentially the same as Balduccini and Gelfond's translation from Gelfond and Lifschitz's action language B to logic programs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For the other, it is essentially the same as Lifschitz and Turner's translation from the action language C to logic programs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This work provides a new perspective on understanding, evaluating and comparing action languages by using sets of properties instead of examples.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The results in this paper provide a characterization of two representative action languages B and C in terms of permissible mappings from our causal action theories to logic programs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It will be interesting to see if other action languages can be similarly characterized, and whether new action formalisms can be defined using different sets of properties.</a>
