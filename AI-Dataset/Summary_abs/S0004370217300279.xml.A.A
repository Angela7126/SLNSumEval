<a href="#0" id="0">When securing complex infrastructures or large environments, constant surveillance of every area is not affordable.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To cope with this issue, a common countermeasure is the usage of cheap but wide-ranged sensors, able to detect suspicious events that occur in large areas, supporting patrollers to improve the effectiveness of their strategies.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, such sensors are commonly affected by uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the present paper, we focus on spatially uncertain alarm signals.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">That is, the alarm system is able to detect an attack but it is uncertain on the exact position where the attack is taking place.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is common when the area to be secured is wide, such as in border patrolling and fair site surveillance.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Patrolling Security Game where a Defender is supported by a spatially uncertain alarm system, which non-deterministically generates signals once a target is under attack.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We show that finding the optimal strategy is FNP-hard even in tree graphs and APX-hard in arbitrary graphs.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We provide two (exponential time) exact algorithms and two (polynomial time) approximation algorithms.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we show that, without false positives and missed detections, the best patrolling strategy reduces to stay in a place, wait for a signal, and respond to it at best.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This strategy is optimal even with non-negligible missed detection rates, which, unfortunately, affect every commercial alarm system.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We evaluate our methods in simulation, assessing both quantitative and qualitative aspects.</a>
