<a href="#0" id="0">This paper proposes incremental preference elicitation methods for multicriteria decision making with a Choquet integral.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The Choquet integral is an evaluation function that performs a weighted aggregation of criterion values using a capacity function assigning a weight to any coalition of criteria, thus enabling positive and/or negative interactions among them and covering an important range of possible decision behaviors.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the specification of the capacity involves many parameters which raises challenging questions, both in terms of elicitation burden and guarantee on the quality of the final recommendation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we investigate the incremental elicitation of the capacity through a sequence of preference queries (questions) selected one-by-one using a minimax regret strategy so as to progressively reduce the set of possible capacities until the regret (the worst-case “loss” due to reasoning with only partially specified capacities) is low enough.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We propose a new approach designed to efficiently compute minimax regret for the Choquet model and we show how this approach can be used in different settings: 1) the problem of recommending a single alternative, 2) the problem of ranking alternatives from best to worst, and 3) sorting several alternatives into ordered categories.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the practical efficiency of our approach for each of these situations.</a>
