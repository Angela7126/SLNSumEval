<a href="#0" id="0">We consider a simple model of cooperation among agents called Coalitional Skill Games (CSGs).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is a restricted form of coalitional games, where each agent has a set of skills that are required to complete various tasks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each task requires a set of skills in order to be completed, and a coalition can accomplish the task only if the coalition ºs agents cover the set of required skills for the task.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The gain for a coalition depends only on the subset of tasks it can complete.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We consider the computational complexity of several problems in CSGs, such as testing if an agent is a dummy or veto agent, computing the core and core-related solution concepts, and computing power indices such as the Shapley value and Banzhaf power index.</a>
