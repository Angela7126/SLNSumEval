<a href="#0" id="0">Planners developed in the Artificial Intelligence community assume that tasks in the task plans they generate will be executed predictably and reliably.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This assumption provides a useful abstraction in that it lets the task planners focus on what tasks should be done, while lower-level motion planners and controllers take care of the details of how the task should be performed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While this assumption is useful in many domains, it becomes problematic when controlling physically embedded systems, where there are often delays, disturbances, and failures.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The task plans do not provide enough information about allowed flexibility in task duration and hybrid state evolution.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Such flexibility could be useful when deciding how to react to disturbances.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">An important domain where this gap has caused problems is robotics, particularly, the operation of robots in unstructured, uncertain environments.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Due to the complexity of this domain, the demands of tasks to be performed, and the actuation limits of robots, knowledge about permitted flexibility in execution of a task is crucial.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We address this gap through two key innovations.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">First, we specify a Qualitative State Plan (QSP), which supports representation of spatial and temporal flexibility with respect to tasks.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Second, we extend compilation approaches developed for temporally flexible execution of discrete activity plans to work with hybrid discrete/continuous systems using a recently developed Linear Quadratic Regulator synthesis algorithm, which performs a state reachability analysis to prune infeasible trajectories, and which determines optimal control policies for feasible state regions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The resulting Model-based Executive is able to take advantage of spatial and temporal flexibility in a QSP to improve handling of disturbances.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Note that in this work, we focus on execution of QSPs, and defer the problem of how they are generated.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We believe the latter could be accomplished through extensions to existing task planners.</a>
