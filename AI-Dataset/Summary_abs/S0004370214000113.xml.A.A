<a href="#0" id="0">Complex engineering systems require efficient on-line fault diagnosis methodologies to improve safety and reduce maintenance costs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Traditionally, diagnosis approaches are centralized, but these solutions do not scale well.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Also, centralized diagnosis solutions are difficult to implement on increasingly prevalent distributed, networked embedded systems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This paper presents a distributed diagnosis framework for physical systems with continuous behavior.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Using Possible Conflicts, a structural model decomposition method from the Artificial Intelligence model-based diagnosis (DX) community, we develop a distributed diagnoser design algorithm to build local event-based diagnosers.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These diagnosers are constructed based on global diagnosability analysis of the system, enabling them to generate local diagnosis results that are globally correct without the use of a centralized coordinator.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also use Possible Conflicts to design local parameter estimators that are integrated with the local diagnosers to form a comprehensive distributed diagnosis framework.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Hence, this is a fully distributed approach to fault detection, isolation, and identification.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We evaluate the developed scheme on a four-wheeled rover for different design scenarios to show the advantages of using Possible Conflicts, and generate on-line diagnosis results in simulation to demonstrate the approach.</a>
