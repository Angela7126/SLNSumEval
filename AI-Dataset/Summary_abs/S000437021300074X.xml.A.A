<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper we present a learning algorithm for Type Extension Trees (TET) that discovers informative count-of-count features in the supervised learning setting.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Experiments on bibliographic data show that TET-learning is able to discover the count-of-count feature underlying the definition of the h-index, and the inverse document frequency feature commonly used in information retrieval.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also introduce a metric on TET feature values.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This metric is defined as a recursive application of the Wasserstein–Kantorovich metric.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Experiments with a k-NN classifier show that exploiting the recursive count-of-count statistics encoded in TET values improves classification accuracy over alternative methods based on simple count statistics.</a>
