<a href="#1" id="1">The qualitative approach to spatial and temporal reasoning, known as Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning (QSTR), typically represents spatial/temporal knowledge in terms of qualitative relations (e.g., to the east of, after), and reasons with spatial/temporal knowledge by solving qualitative constraints.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When formulating qualitative constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), it is usually assumed that each variable could be “here, there and everywhere”.1 Practical applications such as urban planning, however, often require a variable to take its value from a certain finite domain, i.e. it is required to be ‘here or there, but not everywhere’.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Entities in such a finite domain often act as reference objects and are called “landmarks” in this paper.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The paper extends the classical framework of qualitative CSPs by allowing variables to take values from finite domains.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The computational complexity of the consistency problem in this extended framework is examined for the five most important qualitative calculi, viz.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Point Algebra, Interval Algebra, Cardinal Relation Algebra, RCC5, and RCC8.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We show that all these consistency problems remain in NP and provide, under practical assumptions, efficient algorithms for solving basic constraints involving landmarks for all these calculi.</a>
