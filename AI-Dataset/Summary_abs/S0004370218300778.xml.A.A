<a href="#0" id="0">This paper proposes the use of an argumentation framework with recursive attacks to address a trust model in a collaborative open multi-agent system.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our approach is focused on scenarios where agents share information about the credibility (informational trust) they have assigned to their peers.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We will represent informants' credibility through credibility objects which will include not only trust information but also the informant source.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This leads to a recursive setting where the reliability of certain credibility information depends on the credibility of other pieces of information that should be subject to the same analysis.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Credibility objects are maintained in a credibility base which can have information in conflict.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this scenario, we will formally show that our proposal will produce a partially ordered credibility relation; such relation contains the information that can be justified by an argumentation process.</a>
