<a href="#1" id="1">The first drawback is that it is difficult to simultaneously deal with several pairs of ontologies, i.e. finding a universal weight configuration that can be used for different ontology pairs without adjustment.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The second one is that a reference alignment between two ontologies to be aligned should be given in advance which could be very expensive to obtain especially when the scale of ontologies is considerably large.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The last one arises from f-measure, a generally used evaluation metric of the alignment's quality, which may cause the bias improvement of the solution.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To overcome these three defects, in this paper, we propose to use both MatchFmeasure, a rough evaluation metric on no reference alignment to approximate f-measure, and Unanimous Improvement Ratio (UIR), a measure that complements MatchFmeasure, in the process of optimizing the ontology alignments by Memetic Algorithm (MA).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The experimental results have shown that the MA using both MatchFmeasure and UIR is effective to simultaneously align multiple pairs of ontologies and avoid the bias improvement caused by MatchFeasure.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, the comparison with state-of-the-art ontology matching systems further indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</a>
