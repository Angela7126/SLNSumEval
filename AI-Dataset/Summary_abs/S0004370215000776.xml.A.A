<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of ADFs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our results show that while ADFs are one level up in the polynomial hierarchy compared to AFs, there is a useful subclass of ADFs which is as complex as AFs while arguably offering more modeling capacities.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a technical vehicle, we employ the approximation fixpoint theory of Denecker, Marek and Truszczy≈Ñski, thus showing that it is also a useful tool for complexity analysis of operator-based semantics.</a>
