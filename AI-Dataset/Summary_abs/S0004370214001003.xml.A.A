<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper we propose an unsupervised training method for non-intrusive monitoring which, unlike existing supervised approaches, does not require training data to be collected by sub-metering individual appliances, nor does it require appliances to be manually labelled for the households in which disaggregation is performed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Instead, we propose an approach which combines a one-off supervised learning process over existing labelled appliance data sets, with an unsupervised learning method over unlabelled household aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, we propose an approach which uses the Tracebase data set to build probabilistic appliance models which generalise to previously unseen households, which we empirically evaluate through cross validation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Second, we use the Reference Energy Disaggregation Data set to evaluate the accuracy with which these general models can be tuned to the appliances within a specific household using only aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that general appliance models can be constructed using data from only a small number of appliances (typically 3–6 appliances), and furthermore that 28–99% of the remaining behaviour which is specific to a single household can be learned using only aggregate data from existing smart meters.</a>
