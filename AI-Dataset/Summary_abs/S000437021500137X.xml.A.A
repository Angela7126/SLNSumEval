<a href="#0" id="0">The ability to predict the activities of users is an important one for recommender systems and analyses of social media.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">User activities can be represented in terms of relationships involving three or more things (e.g. when a user tags items on a webpage or tweets about a location he or she visited).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Such relationships can be represented as a tensor, and tensor factorization is becoming an increasingly important means for predicting users' possible activities.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, the prediction accuracy of factorization is poor for ambiguous and/or sparsely observed objects.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our solution, Semantic Sensitive Tensor Factorization (SSTF), incorporates the semantics expressed by an object vocabulary or taxonomy into the tensor factorization.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">SSTF first links objects to classes in the vocabulary (taxonomy) and resolves the ambiguities of objects that may have several meanings.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Next, it lifts sparsely observed objects to their classes to create augmented tensors.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Then, it factorizes the original tensor and augmented tensors simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since it shares semantic knowledge during the factorization, it can resolve the sparsity problem.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Furthermore, as a result of the natural use of semantic information in tensor factorization, SSTF can combine heterogeneous and unbalanced datasets from different Linked Open Data sources.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We implemented SSTF in the Bayesian probabilistic tensor factorization framework.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Experiments on publicly available large-scale datasets using vocabularies from linked open data and a taxonomy from WordNet show that SSTF has up to 12% higher accuracy in comparison with state-of-the-art tensor factorization methods.</a>
