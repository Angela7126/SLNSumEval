<a href="#0" id="0">Complete search algorithms for solving Distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOPs) can be divided into two groups: algorithms that use a pseudo tree and algorithms that do not use one.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The best performing algorithms that do not use a pseudo tree use some form of forward bounding.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to try and gain from both worlds, a new algorithm, which incorporates a hybrid approach of the two groups is presented.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The proposed algorithm – Pseudo-Tree Forward-bounding (PT-FB) – is shown to perform very well.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">PT-FB is next extended to be able to solve Asymmetric DCOPs (ADCOPs).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Here again, its performance is better than its competitors.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An extensive experimental evaluation of the performance of each of the proposed algorithms is presented.</a>
