<a href="#0" id="0">This paper tackles the fundamental questions arising when looking at argumentation frameworks as interacting components, characterized by an Input/Output behavior, rather than as isolated monolithical entities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This modeling stance arises naturally in some application contexts, like multi-agent systems, but, more importantly, has a crucial impact on several general application-independent issues, like argumentation dynamics, argument summarization and explanation, incremental computation, and inter-formalism translation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Pursuing this research direction, the paper introduces a general modeling approach and provides a comprehensive set of theoretical results putting the intuitive notion of Input/Output behavior of argumentation frameworks on a solid formal ground.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is achieved by combining three main ingredients.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, several novel notions are introduced at the representation level, notably those of argumentation framework with input, of argumentation multipole, and of replacement of multipoles within a traditional argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Second, several relevant features of argumentation semantics are identified and formally characterized.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In particular, the canonical local function provides an input-aware semantics characterization and a suite of decomposability properties are introduced, concerning the correspondences between semantics outcomes at global and local level.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The third ingredient glues the former ones, as it consists of the investigation of some semantics-dependent properties of the newly introduced entities, namely S-equivalence of multipoles, S-legitimacy and S-safeness of replacements, and transparency of a semantics with respect to replacements.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Altogether they provide the basis and draw the limits of sound interchangeability of multipoles within traditional frameworks.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The paper develops an extensive analysis of all the concepts listed above, covering seven well-known literature semantics and taking into account various, more or less constrained, ways of partitioning an argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Diverse examples, taken from the literature, are used to illustrate the application of the results obtained and, finally, an extensive discussion of the related literature is provided.</a>
