<a href="#0" id="0">Matching and coalition formation are fundamental aspects in the organization of many multi-agent systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In large populations, the emergence of coalitions is often restricted by structural constraints under which agents can reorganize, e.g., local visibility or externality constraints among the agents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We study this aspect using a novel framework for dynamics with constraints within the popular domain of hedonic coalition formation games.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We analyze the effects of structural constraints on the convergence of matching and coalition formation processes to stable states.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our main result are tight characterizations for the constraint structures based on which dynamic coalition formation can stabilize quickly.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We show a variety of convergence results for matching and coalition formation games with different forms of locality and externality constraints.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In particular, we propose and analyze a new model of graph-based visibility for coalition formation games and tightly characterize the graph structures that allow polynomial-time convergence â€“ it can be achieved if and only if coalition formation is based on complete or star graphs.</a>
