<a href="#0" id="0">It is well known that different solution strategies work well for different types of instances of hard combinatorial problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a consequence, most solvers for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) expose parameters that allow them to be customized to a particular family of instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the international SAT competition series, these parameters are ignored: solvers are run using a single default parameter setting (supplied by the authors) for all benchmark instances in a given track.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While this competition format rewards solvers with robust default settings, it does not reflect the situation faced by a practitioner who only cares about performance on one particular application and can invest some time into tuning solver parameters for this application.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The new Configurable SAT Solver Competition (CSSC) compares solvers in this latter setting, scoring each solver by the performance it achieved after a fully automated configuration step.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This article describes the CSSC in more detail, and reports the results obtained in its two instantiations so far, CSSC 2013 and 2014.</a>
