<a href="#0" id="0">State space search is a basic method for analyzing reachability in discrete transition systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To tackle large compactly described transition systems – the state space explosion – a wealth of techniques (e.g., partial-order reduction) have been developed that reduce the search space without affecting the existence of (optimal) solution paths.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Focusing on classical AI planning, where the compact description is in terms of a vector of state variables, an initial state, a goal condition, and a set of actions, we add another technique, that we baptize star-topology decoupling, into this arsenal.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A star topology partitions the state variables into components so that a single center component directly interacts with several leaf components, but the leaves interact only via the center.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Many applications explicitly come with such structure; any classical planning task can be viewed in this way by selecting the center as a subset of state variables separating connected leaf components.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our key observation is that, given such a star topology, the leaves are conditionally independent given the center, in the sense that, given a fixed path of transitions by the center, the possible center-compliant paths are independent across the leaves.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our decoupled search hence branches over center transitions only, and maintains the center-compliant paths for each leaf separately.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As we show, this method has exponential separations to all previous search reduction techniques, i.e., examples where it results in exponentially less effort.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">One can, in principle, prune duplicates in a way so that the decoupled state space can never be larger than the original one.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Standard search algorithms remain applicable using simple transformations.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Our experiments exhibit large improvements on standard AI planning benchmarks with a pronounced star topology.1</a>
