<a href="#0" id="0">Parallel robots enjoy enhanced mechanical characteristics that have to be contrasted with a more complicated design.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, they often have parallel singularities at some poses, and the robots may become uncontrollable, and could even be damaged, in such configurations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The computation of the connected components in the set of nonsingular reachable configurations, called generalized aspects, is therefore a key issue in their design.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This paper introduces a new method, based on numerical constraint programming, to compute a certified enclosure of the generalized aspects.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Though this method does not allow counting their number rigorously, it constructs inner approximations of the nonsingular workspace that allow commanding parallel robots safely.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It also provides a lower-bound on the exact number of generalized aspects.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It is moreover the first general method able to handle any parallel robot in theory, though its computational complexity currently restricts its usage to robots with three degrees of freedom.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, the constraint programming paradigm it relies on makes it possible to consider various additional constraints (e.g., collision avoidance), making it suitable for practical considerations.</a>
