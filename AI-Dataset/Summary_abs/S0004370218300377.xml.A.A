<a href="#0" id="0">We present a technique for automatically extracting mutual exclusion invariants from temporal planning instances.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It first identifies a set of invariant templates by inspecting the lifted representation of the domain and then checks these templates against properties that assure invariance.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our technique builds on other approaches to invariant synthesis presented in the literature but departs from their limited focus on instantaneous actions by addressing temporal domains.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To deal with time, we formulate invariance conditions that account for the entire temporal structure of the actions and the possible concurrent interactions between them.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As a result, we construct a more comprehensive technique than previous methods, which is able to find not only invariants for temporal domains but also a broader set of invariants for sequential domains.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our experimental results provide evidence that our domain analysis is effective at identifying a more extensive set of invariants, which results in the generation of fewer multi-valued state variables.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show that, in turn, this reduction in the number of variables reflects positively on the performance of the temporal planners that use a variable/value representation.</a>
