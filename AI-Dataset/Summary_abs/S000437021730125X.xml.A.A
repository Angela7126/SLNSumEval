<a href="#0" id="0">There are numerous situations when a service requester wishes to expertsource a series of identical but non-trivial tasks from a pool of experts so as to achieve an assured accuracy level for each task, in a cost optimal way.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The experts available are typically heterogeneous with unknown but fixed qualities and different service costs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The service costs are usually private to the experts and the experts could be strategic about their costs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The problem is to select for each task an optimal subset of experts so that the outcome obtained after aggregating the opinions from the selected experts guarantees a target level of accuracy.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The problem is a challenging one even in a non-strategic setting since the accuracy of an aggregated outcome depends on unknown qualities.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We develop a novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) mechanism for solving this problem.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">First, we propose a framework, Assured Accuracy Bandit (AAB) framework, which leads to a MAB algorithm, Constrained Confidence Bound for Non-Strategic Setting (CCB-NS).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We derive an upper bound on the number of time steps this algorithm chooses a sub-optimal set, which depends on the target accuracy and true qualities.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A more challenging situation arises when the requester not only has to learn the qualities of the experts but has to elicit their true service costs as well.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We modify the CCB-NS algorithm to obtain an adaptive exploration separated algorithm Constrained Confidence Bound for Strategic Setting (CCB-S).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The CCB-S algorithm produces an ex-post monotone allocation rule that can then be transformed into an ex-post incentive compatible and ex-post individually rational mechanism.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This mechanism learns the qualities of the experts and guarantees a given target accuracy level in a cost optimal way.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We also provide a lower bound on the number of times any algorithm must select a sub-optimal set and we see that the lower bound matches our upper bound up to a constant factor.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We provide insights on a practical implementation of this framework through an illustrative example and demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms through simulations.</a>
