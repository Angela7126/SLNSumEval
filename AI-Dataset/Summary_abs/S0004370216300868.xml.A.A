<a href="#0" id="0">Social power is a pervasive feature with acknowledged impact in a multitude of social processes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, despite its importance, common approaches to social power interactions in multi-agent systems are rather simplistic and lack a full comprehensive view of the processes involved.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this work, we integrated a comprehensive model of social power dynamics into a cognitive agent architecture based on an operationalization of different bases of social power inspired by theoretical background research in social psychology.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The model was implemented in an agent framework that was subsequently used to generate the behavior of virtual characters in an interactive virtual environment.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We performed a user study to assess users' perceptions of the agents and found evidence supporting both the social power capabilities provided by the model and their value for the creation of believable and interesting scenarios.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We expect that these advances and the collected evidence can be used to support the development of agent systems with an enriched capacity for social agent simulation.</a>
