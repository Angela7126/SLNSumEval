<a href="#1" id="1">At each stage, a player does not know what action the other player will take, but otherwise knows the full state of the game.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This formalism has been used to express games in general game playing and can also model many discrete approximations of real-world scenarios.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we describe both novel and existing algorithms that compute strategies for the class of two-player zero-sum simultaneous move games.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The algorithms include exact backward induction methods with efficient pruning, as well as Monte Carlo sampling algorithms.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We evaluate the algorithms in two different settings: the offline case, where computational resources are abundant and closely approximating the optimal strategy is a priority, and the online search case, where computational resources are limited and acting quickly is necessary.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We perform a thorough experimental evaluation on six substantially different games for both settings.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the exact algorithms, the results show that our pruning techniques for backward induction dramatically improve the computation time required by the previous exact algorithms.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For the sampling algorithms, the results provide unique insights into their performance and identify favorable settings and domains for different sampling algorithms.</a>
