<a href="#0" id="0">Quantifying semantic similarity between linguistic items lies at the core of many applications in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It has therefore received a considerable amount of research interest, which in its turn has led to a wide range of approaches for measuring semantic similarity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, these measures are usually limited to handling specific types of linguistic item, e.g., single word senses or entire sentences.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence, for a downstream application to handle various types of input, multiple measures of semantic similarity are needed, measures that often use different internal representations or have different output scales.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this article we present a unified graph-based approach for measuring semantic similarity which enables effective comparison of linguistic items at multiple levels, from word senses to full texts.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our method first leverages the structural properties of a semantic network in order to model arbitrary linguistic items through a unified probabilistic representation, and then compares the linguistic items in terms of their representations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We report state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets pertaining to three different levels: senses, words, and texts.</a>
