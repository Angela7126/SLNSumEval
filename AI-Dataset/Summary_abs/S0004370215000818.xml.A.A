<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a principled approach for learning parameters in Bayesian networks from incomplete datasets, where the examples of a dataset are subject to equivalence constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These equivalence constraints arise from datasets where examples are tied together, in that we may not know the value of a particular variable, but whatever that value is, we know it must be the same across different examples.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We formalize the problem by defining the notion of a constrained dataset and a corresponding constrained likelihood that we seek to optimize.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We further propose a new learning algorithm that can effectively learn more accurate Bayesian networks using equivalence constraints, which we demonstrate empirically.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, we highlight how our general approach can be brought to bear on more specialized learning tasks, such as those in semi-supervised clustering and topic modeling, where more domain-specific approaches were previously developed.</a>
