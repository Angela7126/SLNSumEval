<a href="#0" id="0">We adopt a utilitarian perspective on social choice, assuming that agents have (possibly latent) utility functions over some space of alternatives.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For many reasons one might consider mechanisms, or social choice functions, that only have access to the ordinal rankings of alternatives by the individual agents rather than their utility functions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this context, one possible objective for a social choice function is the maximization of (expected) social welfare relative to the information contained in these rankings.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We study such optimal social choice functions under three different models, and underscore the important role played by scoring functions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In our worst-case model, no assumptions are made about the underlying distribution and we analyze the worst-case distortion—or degree to which the selected alternative does not maximize social welfare—of optimal (randomized) social choice functions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In our average-case model, we derive optimal functions under neutral (or impartial culture) probabilistic models.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, a very general learning-theoretic model allows for the computation of optimal social choice functions (i.e., ones that maximize expected social welfare) under arbitrary, sampleable distributions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the latter case, we provide both algorithms and sample complexity results for the class of scoring functions, and further validate the approach empirically.</a>
