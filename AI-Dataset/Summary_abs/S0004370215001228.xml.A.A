<a href="#0" id="0">Possible-world semantics are provided for Parikh's relevance-sensitive axiom for belief revision, known as axiom (P).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Loosely speaking, axiom (P) states that if a belief set K can be divided into two disjoint compartments, and the new information ϕ relates only to the first compartment, then the second compartment should not be effected by the revision of K by ϕ. Using the well-known connection between AGM revision functions and preorders on possible worlds as our starting point, we formulate additional constraints on such preorders that characterise precisely Parikh's axiom (P).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Interestingly, the additional constraints essentially generalise a criterion of plausibility between possible worlds that predates axiom (P).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A by-product of our study is the identification of two possible readings of Parikh's axiom (P), which we call the strong and the weak versions of the axiom.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Regarding specific operators, we show that Dalal's belief revision operator satisfies both weak and strong (P), and it is therefore relevance-sensitive.</a>
