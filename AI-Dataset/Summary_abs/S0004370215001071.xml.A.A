<a href="#0" id="0">The study of extension-based semantics within the seminal abstract argumentation model of Dung has largely focused on definitional, algorithmic and complexity issues.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In contrast, matters relating to comparisons of representational limits, in particular, the extent to which given collections of extensions are expressible within the formalism, have been under-developed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As such, little is known concerning conditions under which a candidate set of subsets of arguments are “realistic” in the sense that they correspond to the extensions of some argumentation framework af for a semantics of interest.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper we present a formal basis for examining extension-based semantics in terms of the sets of extensions that these may express within a single af.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We provide a number of characterization theorems which guarantee the existence of afs whose set of extensions satisfy specific conditions and derive complexity results for decision problems that require such characterizations.</a>
