<a href="#0" id="0">In various domains of logic, researchers have made use of a similar intuition: that facts (or models) can be derived from the ground up.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">They typically phrase this intuition by saying, e.g., that the facts should be grounded, or that they should not be unfounded, or that they should be supported by cycle-free arguments, et cetera.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we formalise this intuition in the context of algebraical fixpoint theory.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We define when a lattice element x∈L is grounded for lattice operator O:L→L.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">On the algebraical level, we investigate the relationship between grounded fixpoints and the various classes of fixpoints of approximation fixpoint theory, including supported, minimal, Kripke–Kleene, stable and well-founded fixpoints.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">On the logical level, we investigate groundedness in the context of logic programming, autoepistemic logic, default logic and argumentation frameworks.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We explain what grounded points and fixpoints mean in these logics and show that this concept indeed formalises intuitions that existed in these fields.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We investigate which existing semantics are grounded.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We study the novel semantics for these logics that is induced by grounded fixpoints, which has some very appealing properties, not in the least its mathematical simplicity and generality.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Our results unveil a remarkable uniformity in intuitions and mathematics in these fields.</a>
