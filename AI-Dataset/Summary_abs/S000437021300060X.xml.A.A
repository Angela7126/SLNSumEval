<a href="#0" id="0">Conditional independence is a crucial notion in the development of probabilistic systems which are successfully employed in areas such as computer vision, computational biology, and natural language processing.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We introduce a lattice-theoretic framework that permits the study of the conditional independence (CI) implication problem relative to the class of discrete probability measures.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Semi-lattices are associated with CI statements and a finite, sound and complete inference system relative to semi-lattice inclusions is presented.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This system is shown to be (1) sound and complete for inferring general from saturated CI statements and (2) complete for inferring general from general CI statements.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also show that the general probabilistic CI implication problem can be reduced to that for elementary CI statements.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The completeness of the inference system together with its lattice-theoretic characterization yields a criterion we can use to falsify instances of the probabilistic CI implication problem as well as several heuristics that approximate this falsification criterion in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also propose a validation criterion based on representing constraints and sets of constraints as sparse 0â€“1 vectors which encode their semi-lattices.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The validation algorithm works by finding solutions to a linear programming problem involving these vectors and matrices.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We provide experimental results for this algorithm and show that it is more efficient than related approaches.</a>
