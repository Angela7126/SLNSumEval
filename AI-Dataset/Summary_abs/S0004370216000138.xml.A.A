<a href="#0" id="0">Discriminative systems that can deal with graphs in input are known, however, generative or constructive approaches that can sample graphs from empirical distributions are less developed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Here we propose a Metropolisâ€“Hastings approach that uses a novel type of graph grammar to efficiently learn proposal distributions in a data driven fashion.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We report experimental results in a de-novo molecular synthesis problem where we show that the distribution of the molecules generated by the sampling procedure is accurate enough to improve a predictor's performance in a classification task.</a>
