<a href="#0" id="0">The number of multi-robot systems deployed in field applications has risen dramatically over the years.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Nevertheless, supervising and operating multiple robots simultaneously is a difficult task for a single operator to execute.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this article we propose a novel approach for utilizing automated advising agents in assisting an operator to better manage a team of multiple robots in complex environments.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We introduce an advice provision methodology and exemplify its implementation using automated advising agents in two real-world humanâ€“multi-robot team collaboration tasks: the Search And Rescue (SAR) and the warehouse operation tasks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our intelligent advising agents were evaluated through extensive field trials, with over 150 human operators using both simulated and physical mobile robots, and showed a significant improvement in the team's performance.</a>
