<a href="#0" id="0">We present MultiWiBi, an approach to the automatic creation of two integrated taxonomies for Wikipedia pages and categories written in different languages.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to create both taxonomies in an arbitrary language, we first build them in English and then project the two taxonomies to other languages automatically, without the help of language-specific resources or tools.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The process crucially leverages a novel algorithm which exploits the information available in either one of the taxonomies to reinforce the creation of the other taxonomy.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our experiments show that the taxonomical information in MultiWiBi is characterized by a higher quality and coverage than state-of-the-art resources like DBpedia, YAGO, MENTA, WikiNet, LHD and WikiTaxonomy, also across languages.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">MultiWiBi is available online at http://wibitaxonomy.org/multiwibi.</a>
