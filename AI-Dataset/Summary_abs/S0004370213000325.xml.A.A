<a href="#0" id="0">This paper investigates agent search for the agent with the best value in a multi-agent system, according to some value assignment.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the type of setting considered, agent values are independent of one another.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Under this condition, classic state-space search methods are not very suitable solutions since they must probe the values of all agents in order to determine who the best-valued agent is.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The method considered in this paper refines the number of agents that need to be probed by iteratively publishing thresholds on acceptable agent values.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This kind of agent search is applicable to various domains, including auctions, first responders, and sensor networks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the model considered, there is a fixed cost for publishing the thresholds and a variable cost for obtaining agent values that increases with the number of values obtained.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By transforming the threshold-based sequence to a probability-based one, the sequence with minimum expected cost is proven to consist of either a single search round or an infinite sequence of increasing thresholds.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This leads to a simplified characterization of the optimal thresholds sequence from which the sequence can be derived.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The analysis is extended to the case of search for multiple agents.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">One important implication of this method is that it improves the performance of legacy economic-search methods that are commonly used in “search theory”.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Within this context, we show how a threshold-based search can be used to augment existing economic search techniques or as an economic search technique itself.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The effectiveness of the methods for both best-value search and economic-search is demonstrated numerically using a synthetic environment.</a>
