<a href="#0" id="0">Weighted maximum satisfiability and (unweighted) partial maximum satisfiability (PMS) are two significant generalizations of maximum satisfiability (MAX-SAT), and weighted partial maximum satisfiability (WPMS) is the combination of the two, with more important applications in practice.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Recently, great breakthroughs have been made on stochastic local search (SLS) for weighted MAX-SAT and PMS, resulting in several state-of-the-art SLS algorithms CCLS, Dist and DistUP.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, compared to the great progress of SLS on weighted MAX-SAT and PMS, the performance of SLS on WPMS lags far behind.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we present a new SLS algorithm named CCEHC for WPMS.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">CCEHC employs an extended framework of CCLS with a heuristic emphasizing hard clauses, called EHC.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">With strong accents on hard clauses, EHC has three components: a variable selection mechanism focusing on configuration checking based only on hard clauses, a weighting scheme for hard clauses, and a biased random walk component.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCEHC significantly outperforms its state-of-the-art SLS competitors.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Further experimental results on comparing CCEHC with a state-of-the-art complete solver show the effectiveness of CCEHC on a number of application WPMS instances, and indicate that CCEHC might be beneficial in practice.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Also, empirical analyses confirm the effectiveness of each component underlying the EHC heuristic.</a>
