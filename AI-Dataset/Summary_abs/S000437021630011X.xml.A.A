<a href="#0" id="0">We consider the problem of representing and reasoning about computer programs, and propose a translation from a core procedural iterative programming language to first-order logic with quantification over the domain of natural numbers that includes the usual successor function and the “less than” linear order, essentially a first-order logic with a discrete linear order.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Unlike Hoare's logic, our approach does not rely on loop invariants.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Unlike the typical temporal logic specification of a program, our translation does not require a transition system model of the program, and is compositional on the structures of the program.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Some non-trivial examples are given to show the effectiveness of our translation for proving properties of programs.</a>
