<a href="#0" id="0">Real world applications often require cooperation of multiple independent entities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Classical planning is a well established technique solving various challenging problems such as logistic planning, factory process planning, military mission planning and high-level planning for robots.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Multi-agent planning aims at solving similar problems in the presence of multiple independent entities (agents).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Even though such entities might want to cooperate in order to fulfill a common goal, they may want to keep their internal information and processes private.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In such case, we talk about privacy-preserving multi-agent planning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">So far, multi-agent planners based on heuristic search used either a local heuristic estimating the particular agent's local subproblem or a distributed heuristic estimating the global problem as a whole.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this paper, we present the Multi-Agent Distributed and Local Asynchronous (MADLA) Planner, running a novel variant of a distributed state-space forward-chaining multi-heuristic search which combines the use of a local and a distributed heuristic in order to combine their benefits.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In particular, the planner uses two variants of the well known Fast-Forward heuristic.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We provide proofs of soundness and completeness of the search algorithm and show how much and what type of privacy it preserves.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We also provide an improved privacy-preserving distribution scheme for the Fast-Forward heuristic.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We experimentally compare the newly proposed multi-heuristic scheme and the two used heuristics separately.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The results show that the proposed solution outperforms classical (single-heuristic) distributed search with either one of the heuristics used separately.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In the detailed experimental analysis, we show limits of the planner and of the used heuristics based on particular properties of the benchmark domains.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In a comprehensive set of multi-agent planning domains and problems, we show that the MADLA Planner outperforms all contemporary state-of-the-art privacy-preserving multi-agent planners using a compatible planning model.</a>
