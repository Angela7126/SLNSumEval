<a href="#0" id="0">Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide the basis for various reasoning problems in the area of Artificial Intelligence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Efficient evaluation of AFs has thus been identified as an important research challenge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">So far, implemented systems for evaluating AFs have either followed a straight-forward reduction-based approach or been limited to certain tractable classes of AFs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this work, we present a generic approach for reasoning over AFs, based on the novel concept of complexity-sensitivity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Establishing the theoretical foundations of this approach, we derive several new complexity results for preferred, semi-stable and stage semantics which complement the current complexity landscape for abstract argumentation, providing further understanding on the sources of intractability of AF reasoning problems.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The introduced generic framework exploits decision procedures for problems of lower complexity whenever possible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This allows, in particular, instantiations of the generic framework via harnessing in an iterative way current sophisticated Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver technology for solving the considered AF reasoning problems.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First experimental results show that the SAT-based instantiation of our novel approach outperforms existing systems.</a>
