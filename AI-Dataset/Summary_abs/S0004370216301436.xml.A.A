<a href="#0" id="0">Algorithm selection (AS), selecting the algorithm best suited for a particular problem instance, is acknowledged to be a key issue to make the best out of algorithm portfolios.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This paper presents a collaborative filtering approach to AS.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Collaborative filtering, popularized by the Netflix challenge, aims to recommend the items that a user will most probably like, based on the previous items she liked, and the items that have been liked by other users.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As first noted by Stern et al. [47], algorithm selection can be formalized as a collaborative filtering problem, by considering that a problem instance “likes better“ the algorithms that achieve better performance on this particular instance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Two merits of collaborative filtering (CF) compared to the mainstream algorithm selection (AS) approaches are the following.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Firstly, mainstream AS requires extensive and computationally expensive experiments to learn a performance model, with all algorithms launched on all problem instances, whereas CF can exploit a sparse matrix, with a few algorithms launched on each problem instance.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Secondly, AS learns a performance model as a function of the initial instance representation, whereas CF builds latent factors to describe algorithms and instances, and uses the associated latent metrics to recommend algorithms for a specific problem instance.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A main contribution of the proposed algorithm recommender Alors system is to handle the cold start problem – emitting recommendations for a new problem instance – through the non-linear modeling of the latent factors based on the initial instance representation, extending the linear approach proposed by Stern et al. [47].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The merits and generality of Alors are empirically demonstrated on the ASLib [6] and OpenML [53] benchmarks.</a>
