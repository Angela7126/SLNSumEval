<a href="#0" id="0">The paper proposes a dynamic method, Recursive Symmetry Breaking During Search (ReSBDS), for efficient partial symmetry breaking.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first demonstrate how Partial Symmetry Breaking During Search (ParSBDS) misses important pruning opportunities when given only a subset of symmetries to break.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The investigation pinpoints the culprit and in turn suggests rectification.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The main idea is to add extra symmetry breaking constraints during search recursively to prune also symmetric nodes of some pruned subtrees.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, ReSBDS can break extra symmetry compositions, but is carefully designed to break only the ones that are easy to identify and inexpensive to break.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We present theorems to guarantee the soundness and termination of our approach, and compare our method with popular static and dynamic methods.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">When the variable (value) heuristic is static, ReSBDS is also complete in eliminating all interchangeable variables (values) given only the generator symmetries.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We propose further a light version of ReSBDS method (LReSBDS), which has a slightly weaker pruning power of ReSBDS but with a reduced overhead.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We give theoretical characterization on the soundness and termination of LReSBDS, and comparisons on pruning strengths against other symmetry breaking methods including ReSBDS.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Extensive experimentations confirm the efficiency of ReSBDS and LReSBDS, when compared against state of the art methods.</a>
