<a href="#0" id="0">A known limitation of many diagnosis algorithms is that the number of diagnoses they return can be very large.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is both time consuming and not very helpful from the perspective of a human operator: presenting hundreds of diagnoses to a human operator (charged with repairing the system) is meaningless.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In various settings, including decision support for a human operator and automated troubleshooting processes, it is sufficient to be able to answer a basic diagnostic question: is a given component faulty?</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We propose a way to aggregate an arbitrarily large set of diagnoses to return an estimate of the likelihood of a given component to be faulty.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The resulting mapping of components to their likelihood of being faulty is called the system's health state.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We propose two metrics for evaluating the accuracy of a health state and show that an accurate health state can be found without finding all diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An empirical study explores the question of how many diagnoses are needed to obtain an accurate enough health state, and an online stopping criteria is proposed.</a>
