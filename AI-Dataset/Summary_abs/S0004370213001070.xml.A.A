<a href="#0" id="0">Influence diagrams are intuitive and concise representations of structured decision problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When the problem is non-Markovian, an optimal strategy can be exponentially large in the size of the diagram.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can avoid the inherent intractability by constraining the size of admissible strategies, giving rise to limited memory influence diagrams.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A valuable question is then how small do strategies need to be to enable efficient optimal planning.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Arguably, the smallest strategies one can conceive simply prescribe an action for each time step, without considering past decisions or observations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Previous work has shown that finding such optimal strategies even for polytree-shaped diagrams with ternary variables and a single value node is NP-hard, but the case of binary variables was left open.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this paper we address such a case, by first noting that optimal strategies can be obtained in polynomial time for polytree-shaped diagrams with binary variables and a single value node.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We then show that the same problem is NP-hard if the diagram has multiple value nodes.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">These two results close the fixed-parameter complexity analysis of optimal strategy selection in influence diagrams parametrized by the shape of the diagram, the number of value nodes and the maximum variable cardinality.</a>
