<a href="#0" id="0">We consider partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with limit-average payoff, where a reward value in the interval [0,1] is associated with every transition, and the payoff of an infinite path is the long-run average of the rewards.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We consider two types of path constraints: (i) a quantitative constraint defines the set of paths where the payoff is at least a given threshold λ1∈(0,1]; and (ii) a qualitative constraint which is a special case of the quantitative constraint with λ1=1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We consider the computation of the almost-sure winning set, where the controller needs to ensure that the path constraint is satisfied with probability 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our main results for qualitative path constraints are as follows: (i) the problem of deciding the existence of a finite-memory controller is EXPTIME-complete; and (ii) the problem of deciding the existence of an infinite-memory controller is undecidable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For quantitative path constraints we show that the problem of deciding the existence of a finite-memory controller is undecidable.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also present a prototype implementation of our EXPTIME algorithm and experimental results on several examples.</a>
