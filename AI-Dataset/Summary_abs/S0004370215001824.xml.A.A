<a href="#0" id="0">Our objective is to boost the state-of-the-art performance in MaxSAT solving.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To this end, we employ the instance-specific algorithm configurator ISAC, and improve it with the latest in portfolio technology.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Experimental results on SAT show that this combination marks a significant step forward in our ability to tune algorithms instance-specifically.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We then apply the new methodology to a number of MaxSAT problem domains and show that the resulting solvers consistently outperform the best existing solvers on the respective problem families.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In fact, the solvers presented here were independently evaluated at the 2013 and 2014 MaxSAT Evaluations where they won several categories.</a>
