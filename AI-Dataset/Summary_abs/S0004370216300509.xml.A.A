<a href="#0" id="0">We propose and analyze a novel framework for learning sparse representations based on two statistical techniques: kernel smoothing and marginal regression.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proposed approach provides a flexible framework for incorporating feature similarity or temporal information present in data sets via non-parametric kernel smoothing.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We provide generalization bounds for dictionary learning using smooth sparse coding and show how the sample complexity depends on the L1 norm of kernel function used.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, we propose using marginal regression for obtaining sparse codes which significantly improves the speed and allows one to scale to large dictionary sizes easily.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach, both in terms of accuracy and speed by extensive experimentation on several real data sets.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In addition, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used for improving semi-supervised sparse coding.</a>
