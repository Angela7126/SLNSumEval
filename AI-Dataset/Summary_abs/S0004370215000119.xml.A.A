<a href="#0" id="0">When forming the grand coalition is not possible or optimal, agents need to create a coalition structure.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The idea of the core can be extended to such a case.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we propose an innovative exact algorithm called CoreD to check core-non-emptiness for coalition structures.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A more straightforward exact algorithm based on existing techniques, which we call CoreP, first obtains the value of optimal coalition structure by solving an integer programming problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, it checks whether that value can be divided without making a blocking (dissatisfied) coalition.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In contrast, CoreD first finds a minimal value of the optimal coalition structure so that there exists no blocking coalition.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Next, it checks whether the optimal value equals the minimal value We empirically show that when the core is empty, CoreD is by far superior to CoreP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Also, to find a second-best payoff vector when the core is empty, we propose a new solution concept called the weak ε-core+, which can utilize the approximate value of the optimal coalition structure.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Based on the idea of CoreD, we further develop an algorithm for checking the non-emptiness of the weak ε-core+.</a>
