<a href="#0" id="0">Recent work introduced Generalized First Order Decision Diagrams (GFODD) as a knowledge representation language that is useful in mechanizing decision theoretic planning in relational domains.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">GFODDs generalize function-free first order logic and include numerical values and numerical generalizations of existential and universal quantification.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Previous work presented heuristic inference algorithms for GFODDs and implemented these heuristics in systems for decision theoretic planning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we study the complexity of the computational problems addressed by such implementations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, we study the evaluation problem, the satisfiability problem, and the equivalence problem for GFODDs under the assumption that the size of the intended model is given with the problem, a restriction that guarantees decidability.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our results provide a complete characterization placing these problems within the polynomial hierarchy.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The same characterization applies to the corresponding restriction of problems in first order logic, giving an interesting new avenue for efficient inference when the number of objects is bounded.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our results show that for Σk formulas, and for corresponding GFODDs, evaluation and satisfiability are ΣkP complete, and equivalence is Πk+1P complete.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For Πk formulas evaluation is ΠkP complete, satisfiability is one level higher and is Σk+1P complete, and equivalence is Πk+1P complete.</a>
