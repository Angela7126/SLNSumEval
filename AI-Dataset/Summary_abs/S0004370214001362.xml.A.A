<a href="#0" id="0">Online recommender systems are an important tool that people use to find new music.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To generate recommendations, many systems rely on tag representations of music.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Such systems, however, suffer from tag sparsity, whereby tracks lack a strong tag representation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Current state-of-the-art techniques that reduce this sparsity problem create hybrid systems using multiple representations, for example both content and tags.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper we present a novel hybrid representation that augments sparse tag representations without introducing content directly.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our hybrid representation integrates pseudo-tags learned from content into the tag representation of a track, and a dynamic weighting scheme limits the number of pseudo-tags that are allowed to contribute.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Experiments demonstrate that this method allows tags to remain dominant when they provide a strong representation, and pseudo-tags to take over when tags are sparse.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We show that our approach significantly improves recommendation quality not only for queries with a sparse tag representation but also those that are well-tagged.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our hybrid approach has potential to be extended to other music representations that are used for recommendation but suffer from data sparsity, such as user profiles.</a>
