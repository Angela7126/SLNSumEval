<a href="#0" id="0">In epistemic logic, a key formal theory for reasoning about knowledge in AI and other fields, different notions of group knowledge describe different ways in which knowledge can be associated with a group of agents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Distributed knowledge can be seen as the sum of the knowledge in a group; it is sometimes referred to as the potential knowledge of a group, or the joint knowledge they could obtain if they had unlimited means of communication.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In epistemic logic, a formula of the form DGφ is intended to express the fact that group G has distributed knowledge of φ, that the total information in the group can be used to infer φ. In this paper we show that this is not the same as φ necessarily being true after the members of the group actually share all their information with each other – perhaps contrary to intuitive ideas about what distributed knowledge is.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We furthermore introduce a new operator RG, such that RGφ means that φ is true after G have shared all their information with each other – after G's distributed knowledge has been resolved.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The RG operators are called resolution operators.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We study logics with different combinations of resolution operators and operators for common and distributed knowledge.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Of particular interest is the relationship between distributed and common knowledge.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The main results are characterizations of expressive power, and sound and complete axiomatizations.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We also study the relationship to public announcement logic.</a>
