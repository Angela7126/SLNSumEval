<a href="#0" id="0">We propose relational linear programming, a simple framework for combining linear programs (LPs) and logic programs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A relational linear program (RLP) is a declarative LP template defining the objective and the constraints through the logical concepts of objects, relations, and quantified variables.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This allows one to express the LP objective and constraints relationally for a varying number of individuals and relations among them without enumerating them.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Together with a logical knowledge base, effectively a logic program consisting of logical facts and rules, it induces a ground LP.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This ground LP is solved using lifted linear programming.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">That is, symmetries within the ground LP are employed to reduce its dimensionality, if possible, and the reduced program is solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In contrast to mainstream LP template languages such as AMPL, which features a mixture of declarative and imperative programming styles, RLP's relational nature allows a more intuitive representation of optimization problems, in particular over relational domains.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We illustrate this empirically by experiments on approximate inference in Markov logic networks using LP relaxations, on solving Markov decision processes, and on collective inference using LP support vector machines.</a>
