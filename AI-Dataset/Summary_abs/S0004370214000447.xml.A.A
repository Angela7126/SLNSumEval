<a href="#0" id="0">Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning is an effective yet knowledge intensive problem-solving technique.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It requires humans to encode knowledge in the form of methods and action models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Methods describe how to decompose tasks into subtasks and the preconditions under which those methods are applicable whereas action models describe how actions change the world.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Encoding such knowledge is a difficult and time-consuming process, even for domain experts.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we propose a new learning algorithm, called HTNLearn, to help acquire HTN methods and action models.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">HTNLearn receives as input a collection of plan traces with partially annotated intermediate state information, and a set of annotated tasks that specify the conditions before and after the tasks' completion.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In addition, plan traces are annotated with potentially empty partial decomposition trees that record the processes of decomposing tasks to subtasks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">HTNLearn outputs are a collection of methods and action models.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">HTNLearn first encodes constraints about the methods and action models as a constraint satisfaction problem, and then solves the problem using a weighted MAX-SAT solver.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">HTNLearn can learn methods and action models simultaneously from partially observed plan traces (i.e., plan traces where the intermediate states are partially observable).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We test HTNLearn in several HTN domains.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The experimental results show that our algorithm HTNLearn is both effective and efficient.</a>
