<a href="#0" id="0">Hierarchical clustering is a popular approach in a number of fields with many well known algorithms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, all existing work to our knowledge implements a greedy heuristic algorithm with no explicit objective function.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this work we formalize hierarchical clustering as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem with a natural objective function and the dendrogram properties enforced as linear constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our experimental work shows that even for small data sets finding the global optimum produces more accurate results.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Formalizing hierarchical clustering as an ILP with constraints has several advantages beyond finding the global optima.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Relaxing the dendrogram constraints such as transitivity can produce novel problem variations such as finding hierarchies with overlapping clusterings.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It is also possible to add constraints to encode guidance such as must–link, cannot–link, must–link–before etc.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, though exact solvers exist for ILP we show that a simple randomized algorithm and a linear programming (LP) relaxation can be used to provide approximate solutions faster.</a>
