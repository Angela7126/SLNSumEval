<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a new metric to determine the flexibility of a Simple Temporal Network (STN).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">After reviewing some existing flexibility metrics, we conclude that these metrics fail to capture the dependencies between events specified in the STN.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a consequence, these metrics will usually overestimate the available flexibility in such a system.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We propose to use an intuitively more acceptable flexibility metric.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This metric is based upon the notion of an interval schedule for an STN.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Such an interval schedule specifies an interval for every event in the STN in such a way that, for every event, we are free to choose a starting time within its interval independently from the choice made for other events.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show that an interval schedule that maximizes our flexibility metric is computable in low-order polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As byproducts of this flexibility metric, we discuss simple solutions to problems in STNs with uncertainty (STNUs) and temporal decoupling in STNs.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">With respect to the latter we show that after computing our flexibility metric, we get a decomposition of the STN almost for free.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Even more importantly, we show that contrary to popular belief, such a decomposition does not affect the flexibility of the original STN.</a>
