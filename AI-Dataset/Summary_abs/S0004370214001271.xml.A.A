<a href="#0" id="0">Planning optimal paths for large numbers of robots is computationally expensive.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we introduce a new framework for multirobot path planning called subdimensional expansion, which initially plans for each robot individually, and then coordinates motion among the robots as needed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">More specifically, subdimensional expansion initially creates a one-dimensional search space embedded in the joint configuration space of the multirobot system.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When the search space is found to be blocked during planning by a robot–robot collision, the dimensionality of the search space is locally increased to ensure that an alternative path can be found.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As a result, robots are only coordinated when necessary, which reduces the computational cost of finding a path.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We present the M⁎ algorithm, an implementation of subdimensional expansion that adapts the A⁎ planner to perform efficient multirobot planning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">M⁎ is proven to be complete and to find minimal cost paths.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Simulation results are presented that show that M⁎ outperforms existing optimal multirobot path planning algorithms.</a>
