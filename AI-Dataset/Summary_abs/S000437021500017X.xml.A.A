<a href="#0" id="0">In the absence of external guidance, how can a robot learn to map the many raw pixels of high-dimensional visual inputs to useful action sequences?</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We propose here Continual Curiosity driven Skill Acquisition (CCSA).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">CCSA makes robots intrinsically motivated to acquire, store and reuse skills.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Previous curiosity-based agents acquired skills by associating intrinsic rewards with world model improvements, and used reinforcement learning to learn how to get these intrinsic rewards.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">CCSA also does this, but unlike previous implementations, the world model is a set of compact low-dimensional representations of the streams of high-dimensional visual information, which are learned through incremental slow feature analysis.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These representations augment the robot's state space with new information about the environment.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show how this information can have a higher-level (compared to pixels) and useful interpretation, for example, if the robot has grasped a cup in its field of view or not.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">After learning a representation, large intrinsic rewards are given to the robot for performing actions that greatly change the feature output, which has the tendency otherwise to change slowly in time.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We show empirically what these actions are (e.g., grasping the cup) and how they can be useful as skills.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">An acquired skill includes both the learned actions and the learned slow feature representation.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Skills are stored and reused to generate new observations, enabling continual acquisition of complex skills.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We present results of experiments with an iCub humanoid robot that uses CCSA to incrementally acquire skills to topple, grasp and pick-place a cup, driven by its intrinsic motivation from raw pixel vision.</a>
