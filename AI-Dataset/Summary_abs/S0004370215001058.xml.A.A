<a href="#0" id="0">In this work we introduce a novel approach, based on sampling, for finding assignments that are likely to be solutions to stochastic constraint satisfaction problems and constraint optimisation problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our approach reduces the size of the original problem being analysed; by solving this reduced problem, with a given confidence probability, we obtain assignments that satisfy the chance constraints in the original model within prescribed error tolerance thresholds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To achieve this, we blend concepts from stochastic constraint programming and statistics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We discuss both exact and approximate variants of our method.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The framework we introduce can be immediately employed in concert with existing approaches for solving stochastic constraint programs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A thorough computational study on a number of stochastic combinatorial optimisation problems demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</a>
