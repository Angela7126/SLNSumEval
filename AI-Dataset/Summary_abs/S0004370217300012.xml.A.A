<a href="#0" id="0">Alternating Time Temporal Logic (ATL) is widely used for the verification of multi-agent systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We consider Resource Agent Logic ( RAL), which extends ATL to allow the verification of properties of systems where agents act under resource constraints.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The model checking problem for RAL with unbounded production and consumption of resources is known to be undecidable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We review existing (un)decidability results for fragments of RAL, tighten some existing undecidability results, and identify several aspects which affect decidability of model checking.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One of these aspects is the availability of a ‘do nothing’, or idle action, which does not produce or consume resources.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Analysis of undecidability results allows us to identify a significant new fragment of RAL for which model checking is decidable.</a>
