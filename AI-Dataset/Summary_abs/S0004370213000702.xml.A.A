<a href="#0" id="0">The aim of this paper is to introduce and study model-theoretic notions of modularity in description logic and related reasoning problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our approach is based on a generalisation of logical equivalence that is called model-theoretic inseparability.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Two TBoxes are inseparable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">a vocabulary Σ if they cannot be distinguished by the Σ-reducts of their models and thus can equivalently be replaced by one another in any application where only vocabulary items from Σ are relevant.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We study in-depth the complexity of deciding inseparability for the description logics EL and ALC and their extensions with inverse roles.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We then discuss notions of modules of a TBox based on model-theoretic inseparability and develop algorithms for extracting minimal modules from acyclic TBoxes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of our module extraction algorithm based on the large-scale medical TBox Snomed ct.</a>
