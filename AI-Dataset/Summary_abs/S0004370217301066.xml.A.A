<a href="#0" id="0">Layered learning is a hierarchical machine learning paradigm that enables learning of complex behaviors by incrementally learning a series of sub-behaviors.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A key feature of layered learning is that higher layers directly depend on the learned lower layers.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In its original formulation, lower layers were frozen prior to learning higher layers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This article considers a major extension to the paradigm that allows learning certain behaviors independently, and then later stitching them together by learning at the “seams” where their influences overlap.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The UT Austin Villa 2014 RoboCup 3D simulation team, using such overlapping layered learning, learned a total of 19 layered behaviors for a simulated soccer-playing robot, organized both in series and in parallel.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To the best of our knowledge this is more than three times the number of layered behaviors in any prior layered learning system.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Furthermore, the complete learning process is repeated on four additional robot body types, showcasing its generality as a paradigm for efficient behavior learning.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The resulting team won the RoboCup 2014 championship with an undefeated record, scoring 52 goals and conceding none.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This article includes a detailed experimental analysis of the team's performance and the overlapping layered learning approach that led to its success.</a>
