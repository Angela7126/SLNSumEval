<a href="#0" id="0">In cost-optimal planning we aim to find a sequence of operators that achieve a set of goals with minimum cost.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Symbolic search with Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) performs efficient state space exploration in terms of time and memory.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is crucial in optimal settings, in which large parts of the state space must be explored in order to prove optimality.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, the development of accurate heuristics for explicit-state search in recent years have left symbolic search techniques in a secondary place.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this article we propose two orthogonal improvements for symbolic search planning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">On the one hand, we analyze and compare different methods for image computation in order to efficiently perform the successor generation on symbolic search.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Image computation is the main bottleneck of symbolic search algorithms so an efficient computation is paramount for efficient symbolic search planning.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">On the other hand, we study how to use state-invariant constraints to prune states in symbolic search.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is essential in regression search but it is yet to be exploited in symbolic search planners.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Experiments with symbolic bidirectional uniform-cost search and symbolic A‚Åé search with PDBs show remarkable performance improvements on most IPC benchmark domains.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Overall, with the help of our improvements, symbolic bidirectional search outperforms explicit-state search with state-of-the-art heuristics such as LM-cut across many different domains.</a>
