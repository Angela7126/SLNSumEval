<a href="#0" id="0">We consider the following problem: There is a set of items (e.g., movies) and a group of agents (e.g., passengers on a plane); each agent has some intrinsic utility for each of the items.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our goal is to pick a set of K items that maximize the total derived utility of all the agents (i.e., in our example we are to pick K movies that we put on the plane's entertainment system).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the actual utility that an agent derives from a given item is only a fraction of its intrinsic one, and this fraction depends on how the agent ranks the item among the chosen, available, ones.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We provide a formal specification of the model and provide concrete examples and settings where it is applicable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that the problem is hard in general, but we show a number of tractability results for its natural special cases.</a>
