<a href="#0" id="0">An author's profile on Google Scholar consists of indexed articles and associated data, such as the number of citations and the H-index.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The author is allowed to merge articles; this may affect the H-index.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We analyze the (parameterized) computational complexity of maximizing the H-index using article merges.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Herein, to model realistic manipulation scenarios, we define a compatibility graph whose edges correspond to plausible merges.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, we consider several different measures for computing the citation count of a merged article.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For the measure used by Google Scholar, we give an algorithm that maximizes the H-index in linear time if the compatibility graph has constant-size connected components.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In contrast, if we allow to merge arbitrary articles (that is, for compatibility graphs that are cliques), then already increasing the H-index by one is NP-hard.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Experiments on Google Scholar profiles of AI researchers show that the H-index can be manipulated substantially only if one merges articles with highly dissimilar titles.</a>
