<a href="#0" id="0">For the problem of allocating one or more items among a group of competing agents, the Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism is strategy-proof and efficient.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, the VCG mechanism is not strongly budget balanced: in general, value flows out of the system of agents in the form of VCG payments, which reduces the agents' utilities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In many settings, the objective is to maximize the sum of the agents' utilities (taking payments into account).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For this purpose, several VCG redistribution mechanisms have been proposed that redistribute a large fraction of the VCG payments back to the agents, in a way that maintains strategy-proofness and the non-deficit property.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Unfortunately, sometimes even the best VCG redistribution mechanism fails to redistribute a substantial fraction of the VCG payments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This results in a low total utility for the agents, even though the items are allocated efficiently.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this paper, we study strategy-proof allocation mechanisms that do not always allocate the items efficiently.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It turns out that by allocating inefficiently, more payment can sometimes be redistributed, so that the net effect is an increase in the sum of the agents' utilities.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our objective is to design mechanisms that are competitive against the first-best mechanism in terms of the agents' total utility.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We first study multi-unit auctions with unit demand.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We characterize the family of linear allocation mechanisms.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We propose an optimization technique for simultaneously finding a linear allocation mechanism and a payment redistribution rule, which together are optimal.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">With the help of this technique, we also analytically characterize several competitive mechanisms, which are based on burning units and partitioning the agents into groups.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Finally, we extend the definition of linear allocation mechanisms and the optimization technique to general multi-unit auctions.</a>
