<a href="#0" id="0">Crowdsourcing, outsourcing of tasks to a crowd of unknown people (“workers”) in an open call, is rapidly rising in popularity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is already being heavily used by numerous employers (“requesters”) for solving a wide variety of tasks, such as audio transcription, content screening, and labeling training data for machine learning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, quality control of such tasks continues to be a key challenge because of the high variability in worker quality.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper we show the value of decision-theoretic techniques for the problem of optimizing workflows used in crowdsourcing.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, we design AI agents that use Bayesian network learning and inference in combination with Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for obtaining excellent cost-quality tradeoffs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We use these techniques for three distinct crowdsourcing scenarios: (1) control of voting to answer a binary-choice question, (2) control of an iterative improvement workflow, and (3) control of switching between alternate workflows for a task.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In each scenario, we design a Bayes net model that relates worker competency, task difficulty and worker response quality.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also design a POMDP for each task, whose solution provides the dynamic control policy.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We demonstrate the usefulness of our models and agents in live experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We consistently achieve superior quality results than non-adaptive controllers, while incurring equal or less cost.</a>
