<a href="#0" id="0">Balanced knockout tournaments are one of the most common formats for sports competitions, and are also used in elections and decision-making.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We consider the computational problem of finding the optimal draw for a particular player in such a tournament.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The problem has generated considerable research within AI in recent years.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We prove that checking whether there exists a draw in which a player wins is NP-complete, thereby settling an outstanding open problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our main result has a number of interesting implications on related counting and approximation problems.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We present a memoization-based algorithm for the problem that is faster than previous approaches.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, we highlight two natural cases that can be solved in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">All of our results also hold for the more general problem of counting the number of draws in which a given player is the winner.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, we show that our main NP-completeness result extends to a variant of balanced knockout tournaments called double-elimination tournaments.</a>
