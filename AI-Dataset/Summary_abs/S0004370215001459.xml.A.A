<a href="#0" id="0">The evolving nature and accumulating volume of real-world data inevitably give rise to the so-called “concept drift” issue, causing many deployed Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) systems to require additional maintenance procedures.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Case-base Maintenance (CBM), case-base editing strategies to revise the case-base have proven to be effective instance selection approaches for handling concept drift.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Motivated by current issues related to CBR techniques in handling concept drift, we present a two-stage case-base editing technique.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In Stage 1, we propose a Noise-Enhanced Fast Context Switch (NEFCS) algorithm, which targets the removal of noise in a dynamic environment, and in Stage 2, we develop an innovative Stepwise Redundancy Removal (SRR) algorithm, which reduces the size of the case-base by eliminating redundancies while preserving the case-base coverage.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Experimental evaluations on several public real-world datasets show that our case-base editing technique significantly improves accuracy compared to other case-base editing approaches on concept drift tasks, while preserving its effectiveness on static tasks.</a>
