<a href="#0" id="0">Although the original vision for artificial intelligence was the simulation of (implicitly human) intelligence, research has gradually shifted to autonomous systems that compete with people.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The resultant popular attitude toward artificial intelligence, we argue here, is by turns disdain, grudging acceptance, and fear.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That attitude not only limits our work's potential, but also imperils its support.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This paper proposes a constructive alternative: the development of collaborative intelligence.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As envisioned here, a collaborative intelligence does not require encyclopedic command and need not be limited to a single problem.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The necessary components of a collaborative intelligence are nearly at hand, and the key issues readily identified.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As a first step, this paper proposes three challenging but accessible problems that would both change the public perception of artificial intelligence and spur substantive research to advance our science.</a>
