<a href="#0" id="0">This article considers defeasible beliefs in dynamic settings.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, we examine the belief projection problem: what is believed after performing an action and/or receiving new information?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The approach is based on an epistemic variant of Reiter's situation calculus, where actions not only have physical effects but may also provide new information to the agent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The preferential belief structure is initially determined using conditional statements.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">New information is then incorporated using two popular belief revision schemes, namely natural and lexicographic revision.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The projection problem is solved twofold in this formalism: by goal regression and by knowledge base progression.</a>
