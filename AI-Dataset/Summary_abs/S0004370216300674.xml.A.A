<a href="#0" id="0">In this note we provide a concise report on the complexity of the causal ordering problem, originally introduced by Simon to reason about causal dependencies implicit in systems of mathematical equations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show that Simon's classical algorithm to infer causal ordering is NP-Hard—an intractability previously guessed but never proven.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We present then a detailed account based on Nayak's suggested algorithmic solution (the best available), which is dominated by computing transitive closure—bounded in time by O(|V|⋅|S|), where S(E,V) is the input system structure composed of a set E of equations over a set V of variables with number of variable appearances (density) |S|.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also comment on the potential of causal ordering for emerging applications in large-scale hypothesis management and analytics.</a>
