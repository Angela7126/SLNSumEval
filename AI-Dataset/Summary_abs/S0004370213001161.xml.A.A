<a href="#0" id="0">For Dungʼs model of abstract argumentation under preferred semantics, argumentation frameworks may have several distinct preferred extensions: i.e., in informal terms, sets of acceptable arguments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus the acceptance problem (for a specific argument) can consider deciding whether an argument is in at least one such extensions (credulously accepted) or in all such extensions (skeptically accepted).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We start by presenting a new algorithm that enumerates all preferred extensions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Following this we build algorithms that decide the acceptance problem without requiring explicit enumeration of all extensions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We analyze the performance of our algorithms by comparing these to existing ones, and present experimental evidence that the new algorithms are more efficient with respect to the expected running time.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Moreover, we extend our techniques to solve decision problems in a widely studied development of Dungʼs model: namely value-based argumentation frameworks (vafs).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this regard, we examine analogous notions to the problem of enumerating preferred extensions and present algorithms that decide subjective, respectively objective, acceptance.</a>
