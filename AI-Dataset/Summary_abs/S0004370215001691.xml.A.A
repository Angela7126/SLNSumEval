<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we introduce a new problem, called Top-k SAT, that consists in enumerating the Top-k models of a propositional formula.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A Top-k model is defined as a model with less than k models preferred to it with respect to a preference relation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that Top-k SAT generalizes two well-known problems: the Partial MAX-SAT problem and the problem of computing minimal models.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, we propose a general algorithm for Top-k SAT.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, we give an application of our declarative framework in data mining, namely, the problem of mining Top-k motifs in the transaction databases and in the sequences.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the case of mining sequence data, we introduce a new mining task by considering the sequences of itemsets.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thanks to the flexibility and to the declarative aspects of our SAT-based approach, an encoding of this task is obtained by a very slight modification of mining motifs in the sequences of items.</a>
