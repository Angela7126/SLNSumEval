<a href="#0" id="0">Planners for real robotic systems should not only reason about abstract actions, but also about aspects related to physical execution such as kinematics and geometry.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We present an approach to hybrid task and motion planning, in which state-based forward-chaining task planning is tightly coupled with motion planning and other forms of geometric reasoning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our approach is centered around the problem of geometric backtracking that arises in hybrid task and motion planning: in order to satisfy the geometric preconditions of the current action, a planner may need to reconsider geometric choices, such as grasps and poses, that were made for previous actions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Geometric backtracking is a necessary condition for completeness, but it may lead to a dramatic computational explosion due to the large size of the space of geometric states.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We explore two avenues to deal with this issue: the use of heuristics based on different geometric conditions to guide the search, and the use of geometric constraints to prune the search space.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We empirically evaluate these different approaches, and demonstrate that they improve the performance of hybrid task and motion planning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We demonstrate our hybrid planning approach in two domains: a real, humanoid robotic platform, the DLR Justin robot, performing object manipulation tasks; and a simulated autonomous forklift operating in a warehouse.</a>
