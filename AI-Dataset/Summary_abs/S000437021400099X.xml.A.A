<a href="#0" id="0">Unbiased black-box complexity was introduced as a refined complexity model for random-ized search heuristics (Lehre and Witt (2012) [24]).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For several problems, this notion avoids the unrealistically low complexity results given by the classical model of Droste et al. (2006) [10].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that for some problems the unbiased black-box complexity remains artificially small.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">More precisely, for two different formulations of an NP-hard subclass of the well-known Partition problem, we give mutation-only unbiased black-box algorithms having complexity O(nlog‚Å°n).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This indicates that also the unary unbiased black-box complexity does not give a complete picture of the true difficulty of this problem for randomized search heuristics.</a>
