<a href="#0" id="0">In a sequential auction with multiple bidding agents, the problem of determining the ordering of the items to sell in order to maximize the expected revenue is highly challenging.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The challenge is largely due to the fact that the autonomy and private information of the agents heavily influence the outcome of the auction.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The main contribution of this paper is two-fold.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, we demonstrate how to apply machine learning techniques to solve the optimal ordering problem in sequential auctions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We learn regression models from historical auctions, which are subsequently used to predict the expected value of orderings for new auctions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given the learned models, we propose two types of optimization methods: a black-box best-first search approach, and a novel white-box approach that maps learned regression models to integer linear programs (ILP), which can then be solved by any ILP-solver.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Although the studied auction design problem is hard, our proposed optimization methods obtain good orderings with high revenues.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our second main contribution is the insight that the internal structure of regression models can be efficiently evaluated inside an ILP solver for optimization purposes.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To this end, we provide efficient encodings of regression trees and linear regression models as ILP constraints.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This new way of using learned models for optimization is promising.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As the experimental results show, it significantly outperforms the black-box best-first search in nearly all settings.</a>
