<a href="#0" id="0">This article puts forward the application of Counterexample Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) in solving the well-known PSPACE-complete problem of quantified Boolean formulas (QBF).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The article studies the application of CEGAR in two scenarios.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the first scenario, CEGAR is used to expand quantifiers of the formula and subsequently a satisfiability (SAT) solver is applied.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First it is shown how to do that for two levels of quantification and then it is generalized for arbitrary number of levels by recursion.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is also shown that these ideas can be generalized to non-prenex and non-CNF QBF solvers.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the second scenario, CEGAR is employed as an additional learning technique in an existing DPLL-based QBF solver.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Experimental evaluation of the implemented prototypes shows that the CEGAR-driven solver outperforms existing solvers on a number of benchmark families and that the DPLL solver benefits from the additional type of learning.</a>
