<a href="#0" id="0">Commonsense reasoning patterns such as interpolation and a fortiori inference have proven useful for dealing with gaps in structured knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An important difficulty in applying these reasoning patterns in practice is that they rely on fine-grained knowledge of how different concepts and entities are semantically related.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we show how the required semantic relations can be learned from a large collection of text documents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To this end, we first induce a conceptual space from the text documents, using multi-dimensional scaling.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We then rely on the key insight that the required semantic relations correspond to qualitative spatial relations in this conceptual space.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Among others, in an entirely unsupervised way, we identify salient directions in the conceptual space which correspond to interpretable relative properties such as ‘more fruity than’ (in a space of wines), resulting in a symbolic and interpretable representation of the conceptual space.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To evaluate the quality of our semantic relations, we show how they can be exploited by a number of commonsense reasoning based classifiers.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We experimentally show that these classifiers can outperform standard approaches, while being able to provide intuitive explanations of classification decisions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A number of crowdsourcing experiments provide further insights into the nature of the extracted semantic relations.</a>
