<a href="#1" id="1">The modeling task requires some expertise in constraint programming.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This requirement is a bottleneck to the broader uptake of constraint technology.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Several approaches have been proposed to assist the non-expert user in the modeling task.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This paper presents the basic architecture for acquiring constraint networks from examples classified by the user.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The theoretical questions raised by constraint acquisition are stated and their complexity is given.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We then propose Conacq, a system that uses a concise representation of the learner's version space into a clausal formula.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Based on this logical representation, our architecture uses strategies for eliciting constraint networks in both the passive acquisition context, where the learner is only provided a pool of examples, and the active acquisition context, where the learner is allowed to ask membership queries to the user.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The computational properties of our strategies are analyzed and their practical effectiveness is experimentally evaluated.</a>
