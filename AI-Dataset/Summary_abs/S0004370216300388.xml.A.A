<a href="#0" id="0">The task of algorithm selection involves choosing an algorithm from a set of algorithms on a per-instance basis in order to exploit the varying performance of algorithms over a set of instances.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The algorithm selection problem is attracting increasing attention from researchers and practitioners in AI.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Years of fruitful applications in a number of domains have resulted in a large amount of data, but the community lacks a standard format or repository for this data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This situation makes it difficult to share and compare different approaches effectively, as is done in other, more established fields.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It also unnecessarily hinders new researchers who want to work in this area.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To address this problem, we introduce a standardized format for representing algorithm selection scenarios and a repository that contains a growing number of data sets from the literature.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our format has been designed to be able to express a wide variety of different scenarios.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">To demonstrate the breadth and power of our platform, we describe a study that builds and evaluates algorithm selection models through a common interface.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The results display the potential of algorithm selection to achieve significant performance improvements across a broad range of problems and algorithms.</a>
