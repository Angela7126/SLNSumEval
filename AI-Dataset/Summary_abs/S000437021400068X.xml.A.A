<a href="#0" id="0">Social network analysis is a methodology used extensively in social science.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Classical social networks can only represent the qualitative relationships between actors, but weighted social networks can describe the degrees of connection between actors.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In a classical social network, regular equivalence is used to capture the similarity between actors based on their links to other actors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Specifically, two actors are deemed regularly equivalent if they are equally related to equivalent others.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The definition of regular equivalence has been extended to weighted social networks in two ways.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The first definition, called regular similarity, considers regular equivalence as an equivalence relation that commutes with the underlying graph edges; while the second definition, called generalized regular equivalence, is based on the notion of role assignment or coloring.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A role assignment (resp.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">coloring) is a mapping from the set of actors to a set of roles (resp.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">colors).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The mapping is regular if actors assigned to the same role have the same roles in their neighborhoods.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Recently, it was shown that social positions based on regular equivalence can be syntactically expressed as well-formed formulas in a kind of modal logic.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Thus, actors occupying the same social position based on regular equivalence will satisfy the same set of modal formulas.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this paper, we present analogous results for regular similarity and generalized regular equivalence based on many-valued modal logics.</a>
