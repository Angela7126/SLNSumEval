<a href="#0" id="0">Planning is motivated by acting.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Most of the existing work on automated planning underestimates the reasoning and deliberation needed for acting; it is instead biased towards path-finding methods in a compactly specified state-transition system.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Researchers in this AI field have developed many planners, but very few actors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We believe this is one of the main causes of the relatively low deployment of automated planning applications.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we advocate a change in focus to actors as the primary topic of investigation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Actors are not mere plan executors: they may use planning and other deliberation tools, before and during acting.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This change in focus entails two interconnected principles: a hierarchical structure to integrate the actor ºs deliberation functions, and continual online planning and reasoning throughout the acting process.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the paper, we discuss open problems and research directions toward that objective in knowledge representations, model acquisition and verification, synthesis and refinement, monitoring, goal reasoning, and integration.</a>
