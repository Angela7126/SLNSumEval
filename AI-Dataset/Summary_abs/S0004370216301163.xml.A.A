<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we introduce arbitrary arrow update logic (AAUL).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The logic AAUL takes arrow update logic, a dynamic epistemic logic where the accessibility relations of agents are updated rather than the set of possible worlds, and adds a quantifier over such arrow updates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We investigate the relative expressivity of AAUL compared to other logics, most notably arbitrary public announcement logic (APAL).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Additionally, we show that the model checking problem for AAUL is PSPACE-complete.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, we introduce a proof system for AAUL, and prove it to be sound and complete.</a>
