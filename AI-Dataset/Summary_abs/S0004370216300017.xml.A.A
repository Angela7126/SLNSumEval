<a href="#0" id="0">We consider conjunctive query inseparability of description logic knowledge bases with respect to a given signature—a fundamental problem in knowledge base versioning, module extraction, forgetting and knowledge exchange.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We give a uniform game-theoretic characterisation of knowledge base conjunctive query inseparability and develop worst-case optimal decision algorithms for fragments of Horn-ALCHI, including the description logics underpinning OWL 2 QL and OWL 2 EL.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also determine the data and combined complexity of deciding query inseparability.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While query inseparability for all of these logics is P-complete for data complexity, the combined complexity ranges from P- to ExpTime- to 2ExpTime-completeness.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We use these results to resolve two major open problems for OWL 2 QL by showing that TBox query inseparability and the membership problem for universal conjunctive query solutions in knowledge exchange are both ExpTime-complete for combined complexity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, we introduce a more flexible notion of inseparability which compares answers to conjunctive queries in a given signature over a given set of individuals.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this case, checking query inseparability becomes NP-complete for data complexity, but the ExpTime- and 2ExpTime-completeness combined complexity results are preserved.</a>
