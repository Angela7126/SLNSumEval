<a href="#0" id="0">When solving a combinatorial problem using Constraint Programming (CP) or Satisfiability (SAT), modelling and formulation are vital and difficult tasks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Even an expert human may explore many alternatives in modelling a single problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We make a number of contributions in the automated modelling and reformulation of constraint models.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We study a range of automated reformulation techniques, finding combinations of techniques which perform particularly well together.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We introduce and describe in detail a new algorithm, X-CSE, to perform Associativeâ€“Commutative Common Subexpression Elimination (AC-CSE) in constraint problems, significantly improving existing CSE techniques for associative and commutative operators such as +.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We demonstrate that these reformulation techniques can be integrated in a single automated constraint modelling tool, called Savile Row, whose architecture we describe.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We use Savile Row as an experimental testbed to evaluate each reformulation on a set of 50 problem classes, with 596 instances in total.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our recommended reformulations are well worthwhile even including overheads, especially on harder instances where solver time dominates.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">With a SAT solver we observed a geometric mean of 2.15 times speedup compared to a straightforward tailored model without recommended reformulations.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Using a CP solver, we obtained a geometric mean of 5.96 times speedup for instances taking over 10 seconds to solve.</a>
