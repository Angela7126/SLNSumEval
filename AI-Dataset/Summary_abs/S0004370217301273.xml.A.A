<a href="#0" id="0">Due to a proliferation and diversity of approaches to structured argumentation with prioritized rules, several simple and intuitive principles for characterization and evaluation of the proposed attack relations have recently been introduced in [23].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While the proposed principles and properties are helpful, they do not identify unique attack relations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Any user of structured argumentation still faces a fundamental problem of determining an appropriate attack relation for her/his application and further principles that could help in identifying such attack relation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We argue that a key purpose of introducing priorities between defeasible rules is to remove undesired attacks while keeping the set of removed attacks to a minimum.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This intuitive idea could be viewed as a kind of minimal-removal-principle.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We show in this paper that the minimal-removal-principle together with a new simple and intuitive property of inconsistency-resolving and previously proposed properties indeed characterize a unique attack relation referred to as the canonical attack relation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show that canonical attack relations could be characterized in three distinct ways, as the supremum of a complete upper-semilattice of regular attack relations, or by removing the undesired attacks from the basic attack relations where the undesired attacks are captured by a least-fixed point of an intuitive removal function, or as the normal attack relations introduced in an earlier paper for a class of well-prioritized knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We start our study with a language consisting only of literals and two type of attacks, rebut and undercut.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We then show that our approach can easily be scaled up by showing that all key results still hold for general underlying logical languages and the inclusion of assumptions.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We apply our proposed approach to valued-based argumentation and show that it also leads to the canonical semantics.</a>
