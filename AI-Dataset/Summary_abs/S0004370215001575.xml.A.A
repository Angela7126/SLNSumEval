<a href="#0" id="0">We discuss a new implementation of, and new experiments with, Fajtlowicz's Dalmatian conjecture-making heuristic.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our program makes conjectures about relations of real number invariants of mathematical objects.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Conjectures in matrix theory, number theory, and graph theory are reported, together with an experiment in using conjectures to automate game play.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The program can be used in a way that, by design, advances mathematical research.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These experiments suggest that automated conjecture-making can be a useful ability in the design of machines that can perform a variety of tasks that require intelligence.</a>
