<a href="#0" id="0">The simulation of mathematical reasoning has been a driving force throughout the history of Artificial Intelligence research.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, despite significant successes in computer mathematics, computers are not widely used by mathematicians apart from their quotidian applications.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An oft-cited reason for this is that current computational systems cannot do mathematics in the way that humans do.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We draw on two areas in which Automated Theorem Proving (ATP) is currently unlike human mathematics: firstly in a focus on soundness, rather than understandability of proof, and secondly in social aspects.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Employing techniques and tools from argumentation to build a framework for mixed-initiative collaboration, we develop three complementary arcs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the first arc – our theoretical model – we interpret the informal logic of mathematical discovery proposed by Lakatos, a philosopher of mathematics, through the lens of dialogue game theory and in particular as a dialogue game ranging over structures of argumentation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In our second arc – our abstraction level – we develop structured arguments, from which we induce abstract argumentation systems and compute the argumentation semantics to provide labelings of the acceptability status of each argument.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The output from this stage corresponds to a final, or currently accepted proof artefact, which can be viewed alongside its historical development.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, in the third arc – our computational model – we show how each of these formal steps is available in implementation.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In an appendix, we demonstrate our approach with a formal, implemented example of real-world mathematical collaboration.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We conclude the paper with reflections on our mixed-initiative collaborative approach.</a>
