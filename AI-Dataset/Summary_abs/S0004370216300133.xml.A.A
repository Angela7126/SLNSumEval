<a href="#0" id="0">This paper considers matching problems with individual/regional minimum/maximum quotas.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although such quotas are relevant in many real-world settings, there is a lack of strategyproof mechanisms that take such quotas into account.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We first show that without any restrictions on the regional structure, checking the existence of a feasible matching that satisfies all quotas is NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then, assuming that regions have a hierarchical structure (i.e., a tree), we show that checking the existence of a feasible matching can be done in time linear in the number of regions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We develop two strategyproof matching mechanisms based on the Deferred Acceptance mechanism (DA), which we call Priority List based Deferred Acceptance with Regional minimum and maximum Quotas (PLDA-RQ) and Round-robin Selection Deferred Acceptance with Regional minimum and maximum Quotas (RSDA-RQ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When regional quotas are imposed, a stable matching may no longer exist since fairness and nonwastefulness, which compose stability, are incompatible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show that both mechanisms are fair.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As a result, they are inevitably wasteful.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We show that the two mechanisms satisfy different versions of nonwastefulness respectively; each is weaker than the original nonwastefulness.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Moreover, we compare our mechanisms with an artificial cap mechanism via simulation experiments, which illustrate that they have a clear advantage in terms of nonwastefulness and student welfare.</a>
