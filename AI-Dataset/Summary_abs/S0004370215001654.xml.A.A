<a href="#0" id="0">Today's ontology applications require efficient and reliable description logic (DL) reasoning services.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Expressive DLs usually have high worst case complexity while tractable DLs are restricted in terms of expressive power.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This brings a new challenge: can users use expressive DLs to build their ontologies and still enjoy the efficient services as in tractable languages?</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Approximation has been considered as a solution to this challenge; however, traditional approximation approaches have limitations in terms of performance and usability.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we present a tractable approximate reasoning framework for OWL 2 that improves efficiency and guarantees soundness.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Evaluation on ontologies from benchmarks and real-world use cases shows that our approach can do reasoning on complex ontologies efficiently with a high recall.</a>
