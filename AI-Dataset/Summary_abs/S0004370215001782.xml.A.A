<a href="#1" id="1">In this article, we investigate three issues of term translation in the context of statistical machine translation and propose three corresponding models: (a) a term translation disambiguation model which selects desirable translations for terms in the source language with domain information, (b) a term translation consistency model that encourages consistent translations for terms with a high strength of translation consistency throughout a document, and (c) a term unithood model that rewards translation hypotheses where source terms are translated into target strings as a whole unit.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We integrate the three models into hierarchical phrase-based SMT and evaluate their effectiveness on NIST Chineseâ€“English translation with large-scale training data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Experiment results show that all three models can achieve substantial improvements over the baseline.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our analyses also suggest that the proposed models are capable of improving term translation.</a>
