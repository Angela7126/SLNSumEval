<a href="#0" id="0">Conflict-directed learning is ubiquitous in constraint satisfaction problems like SAT, but has been elusive for state space search on reachability problems like classical planning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Almost all existing approaches learn nogoods relative to a fixed solution-length bound, in which case planning/reachability reduces to a constraint satisfaction problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Here we introduce an approach to learning more powerful nogoods, that are sound regardless of solution length, i.e., that identify dead-end states for which no solution exists.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The key technique we build on are critical-path heuristics hC, relative to a set C of conjunctions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These recognize a dead-end state s, returning hC(s)=∞, if s has no solution even when allowing to break up conjunctive subgoals into the elements of C. Our key idea is to learn C during search.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Whenever forward search has identified an unrecognized dead-end s, where hC(s)<∞, we analyze the situation at s, and add new conjunctions into C in a way guaranteeing to obtain hC(s)=∞.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus we learn to recognize s, as well as similar dead-ends search may encounter in the future.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We furthermore learn clauses ϕ where s′⊭ϕ implies hC(s′)=∞, to avoid the overhead of computing hC on every search state.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Arranging these techniques in a depth-first search, we obtain an algorithm approaching the elegance of nogood learning in constraint satisfaction, learning to refute search subtrees.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We run comprehensive experiments on solvable and unsolvable planning benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In cases where forward search can identify dead-ends, and where hC dead-end detection is effective, our techniques reduce the depth-first search space size by several orders of magnitude, and often result in state-of-the-art performance.</a>
