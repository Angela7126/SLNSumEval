<a href="#0" id="0">Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is the satisfiability problem for first-order formulae with respect to background theories.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">SMT extends the propositional satisfiability by introducing various underlying theories.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To improve the efficiency of SMT solving, many efforts have been made on low-level algorithms but they generally cannot leverage the capability of parallel hardware.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We propose a high-level and flexible framework, namely lazy decomposition and conciliation (LDC), to parallelize solving for quantifier-free SMT problems.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Overall, a SMT problem is firstly decomposed into subproblems, then local reasoning inside each subproblem is conciliated with the global reasoning over the shared symbols across subproblems in parallel.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">LDC can be built on any existing solver without tuning its internal implementation, and is flexible as it is applicable to various underlying theories.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We instantiate LDC in the theory of equality with uninterpreted functions, and implement a parallel solver PZ3 based on Z3.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Experiment results on the QF_UF benchmarks from SMT-LIB as well as random problems show the potential of LDC, as (1) PZ3 generally outperforms Z3 in 4 out of 8 problem subcategories under various core configurations; (2) PZ3 usually achieves super-linear speed-up over Z3 on problems with sparse structures, which makes it possible to choose an appropriate solver from Z3 and PZ3 in advance according to the structure of input problem; (3) compared to PCVC4, a state-of-the-art portfolio-based parallel SMT solver, PZ3 achieves speed-up on a larger portion of problems and has better overall speed-up ratio.</a>
