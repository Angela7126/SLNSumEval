<a href="#0" id="0">When agents know a protocol, this leads them to have expectations about future observations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Agents can update their knowledge by matching their actual observations with the expected ones.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">They eliminate states where they do not match.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we study how agents perceive protocols that are not commonly known, and propose a semantics-driven logical framework to reason about knowledge in such scenarios.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, we introduce the notion of epistemic expectation models and a propositional dynamic logic-style epistemic logic for reasoning about knowledge via matching agents º expectations to their observations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It is shown how epistemic expectation models can be obtained from epistemic protocols.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Furthermore, a characterization is presented of the effective equivalence of epistemic protocols.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We introduce a new logic that incorporates updates of protocols and that can model reasoning about knowledge and observations.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, the framework is extended to incorporate fact-changing actions, and a worked-out example is given.</a>
