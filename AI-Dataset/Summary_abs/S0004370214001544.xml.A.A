<a href="#0" id="0">Autonomous robots that are to perform complex everyday tasks such as making pancakes have to understand how the effects of an action depend on the way the action is executed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Within Artificial Intelligence, classical planning reasons about whether actions are executable, but makes the assumption that the actions will succeed (with some probability).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this work, we have designed, implemented, and analyzed a framework that allows us to envision the physical effects of robot manipulation actions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We consider envisioning to be a qualitative reasoning method that reasons about actions and their effects based on simulation-based projections.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thereby it allows a robot to infer what could happen when it performs a task in a certain way.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is achieved by translating a qualitative physics problem into a parameterized simulation problem; performing a detailed physics-based simulation of a robot plan; logging the state evolution into appropriate data structures; and then translating these sub-symbolic data structures into interval-based first-order symbolic, qualitative representations, called timelines.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The result of the envisioning is a set of detailed narratives represented by timelines which are then used to infer answers to qualitative reasoning problems.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By envisioning the outcome of actions before committing to them, a robot is able to reason about physical phenomena and can therefore prevent itself from ending up in unwanted situations.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Using this approach, robots can perform manipulation tasks more efficiently, robustly, and flexibly, and they can even successfully accomplish previously unknown variations of tasks.</a>
