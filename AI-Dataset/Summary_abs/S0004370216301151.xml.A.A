<a href="#0" id="0">We present a computational model that takes into account semantics for language learning and allows us to model meaning-preserving corrections.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The model is constructed with a learner and a teacher who interact in a sequence of shared situations by producing utterances intended to denote a unique object in each situation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We test our model with limited sublanguages of 10 natural languages exhibiting a variety of linguistic phenomena.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The results show that learning to a high level of performance occurs after a reasonable number of interactions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Comparing the effect of a teacher who does no correction to that of a teacher who corrects whenever possible, we show that under certain conditions corrections can accelerate the rate of learning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also define and analyze a simplified model of a probabilistic process of collecting corrections to help understand the possibilities and limitations of corrections in our setting.</a>
