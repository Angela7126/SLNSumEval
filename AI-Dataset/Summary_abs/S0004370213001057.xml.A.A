<a href="#0" id="0">Cyclic scheduling problems consist in ordering a set of activities executed indefinitely over time in a periodic fashion, subject to precedence and resource constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This class of problems has many applications in manufacturing, embedded systems and compiler design, production and chemical systems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This paper proposes a Constraint Programming approach for cyclic scheduling problems, based on modular arithmetic: in particular, we introduce a modular precedence constraint and a global cumulative constraint along with their filtering algorithms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We discuss two possible formulations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first one (referred to as CROSS) models a pure cyclic scheduling problem and makes use of both our novel constraints.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The second formulation (referred to as CROSS‚Åé) introduces a restrictive assumption to enable the use of classical resources constraints, but may incur a loss of solution quality.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Many traditional approaches to cyclic scheduling operate by fixing the period value and then solving a linear problem in a generate-and-test fashion.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Conversely, our technique is based on a non-linear model and tackles the problem as a whole: the period value is inferred from the scheduling decisions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our approach has been tested on a number of non-trivial synthetic instances and on a set of realistic industrial instances.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The method proved to effective in finding high quality solutions in a very short amount of time.</a>
