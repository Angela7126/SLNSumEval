<a href="#0" id="0">Multiplying the heuristic function by a weight greater than one is a well-known technique in heuristic search.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When this technique is applied to A* with an admissible heuristic it yields substantial runtime savings, at the expense of sacrificing solution optimality.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Its applicability to real-time heuristic search, a search approach that builds upon heuristic search, however, has only been explored by a few studies.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this article we present two new approaches to using weights in real-time heuristic search, applicable to a wide range of algorithms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first one, weighted lookahead, is a variant of an existing approach by Shimbo and Ishida, and utilizes the weight while the algorithm performs lookahead search.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The second one, weighted update, incorporates the weight to the edges of the search graph during the learning phase.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We implemented both techniques within LSS-LRTA* and evaluated them in path-planning benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We show that weighted lookahead outperforms an existing approach by Shimbo and Ishida but that it does not improve over existing approaches that do not use weights.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Weighted update, on the other hand, yields performance improvements of up to one order of magnitude both in solution cost and total search time.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To illustrate further the generality of weighted update, we incorporate the technique in two other well-known real-time heuristic search algorithms: LRTA*-LS and daLSS-LRTA*, and we empirically show significant improvements for LRTA*-LS and modest but still important improvements for daLSS-LRTA*.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We analyze the properties of weighted update in depth, showing, among other things, that it guarantees termination.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Convergence behavior of LSS-LRTA*, modified to use weighted update, is also analyzed.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In such a setting, we prove solutions are w-optimal, and provide additional bounds on solution quality that in practice are tighter than w-optimality.</a>
