<a href="#0" id="0">Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) has been used to solve efficiently many combinatorial optimization problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">At recent editions of international MaxSAT Evaluation (MSE), the best performing solvers for real world (industrial) problems were those implementing SAT-based algorithms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These algorithms reformulate the MaxSAT optimization problem into a sequence of SAT decision problems where Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints may be introduced.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to identify the most suitable PB constraints, some algorithms (core-guided) analyze the unsatisfiable cores retrieved from the previous SAT problems in the sequence while refining the lower bound.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study on the complete core-guided algorithms Eva and OLL, that inspired the best performing solvers on industrial instances at MSE-2014.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Despite of its apparently different foundations, we show how they are intimately related and identify how to improve them.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this sense, we present our complete core-guided algorithm WPM3.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We show how to further exploit the analysis of unsatisfiable cores by being aware of their global structure, i.e., how the cores are interrelated.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is used to encode more efficient PB constraints and enables the algorithm to obtain assignments and refine also the upper bound.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore, WPM3 can also work as an incomplete algorithm.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">At MSE-2015, it showed a competitive performance on industrial instances.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">It got one out of three gold medals at the complete track and dominated at the incomplete track.</a>
