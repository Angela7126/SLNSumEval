<a href="#0" id="0">We report a novel approach to visual analogical reasoning, one afforded expressly by fractal representations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first describe the nature of visual analogies and fractal representations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Next, we exhibit the Fractal Ravens algorithm through a detailed example, describe its performance on all major variants of the Raven's Progressive Matrices tests, and discuss the implications and next steps.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition, we illustrate the importance of considering the confidence of the answers, and show how ambiguity may be used as a guide for the automatic adjustment of the problem representation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To our knowledge, this is the first published account of a computational model's attempt at the entire Raven's test suite.</a>
