<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we introduce a formalism for single-agent decision making that is based on Dynamic Argumentation Frameworks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The formalism can be used to justify a choice, which is based on the current situation the agent is involved.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Taking advantage of the inference mechanism of the argumentation formalism, it is possible to consider preference relations, and conflicts among the available alternatives for that reasoning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">With this formalization, given a particular set of evidence, the justified conclusions supported by warranted arguments will be used by the agent's decision rules to determine which alternatives will be selected.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also present an algorithm that implements a choice function based on our formalization.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, we complete our presentation by introducing formal results that relate the proposed framework with approaches of classical decision theory.</a>
