<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a formal model for argumentation-based dialogues between agents, using assumption-based argumentation (ABA) as the underlying argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, the dialogues amount to conducting an argumentation process in ABA.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The model is given in terms of ABA-specific utterances, debate trees and forests implicitly built during and drawn from dialogues, legal-move functions (amounting to protocols) and outcome functions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The model is generic in that it is not restricted to any specific dialogue types and can be used to support a wide range thereof.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We prove a formal connection between dialogues and three well-known argumentation semantics (i.e. grounded, admissible and ideal extensions), by giving soundness results for our dialogue models with respect to these semantics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, our dialogues can be seen as a distributed mechanism for successfully determining acceptability of claims (with respect to the semantics considered), while constructing argumentation frameworks and arguments for these claims.</a>
