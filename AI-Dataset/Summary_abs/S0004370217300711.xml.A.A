<a href="#0" id="0">Lightweight description logics are knowledge representation formalisms characterised by the low complexity of their standard reasoning tasks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">They have been successfully employed for constructing large ontologies that model domain knowledge in several different practical applications.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to maintain these ontologies, it is often necessary to detect the axioms that cause a given consequence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This task is commonly known as axiom pinpointing.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we provide a thorough analysis of the complexity of several decision, counting, and enumeration problems associated to axiom pinpointing in lightweight description logics.</a>
