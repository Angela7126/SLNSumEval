<a href="#0" id="0">We compare different epistemic notions in the presence of awareness of propositional variables: the logic of implicit knowledge (in which explicit knowledge is definable), the logic of explicit knowledge, and the logic of speculative knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Speculative knowledge is a novel epistemic notion that permits reasoning about unawareness.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These logics are interpreted on epistemic awareness models: these are multi-agent Kripke structures for propositional awareness (in each state an agent may only be aware of formulas containing occurrences of a subset of all propositional variables).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Different notions of bisimulation are suitable for these logics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We provide correspondence between bisimulation and modal equivalence on image-finite models for these logics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Expressivity and axiomatizations are investigated for models without restrictions, and for models with equivalence relations for all agents (modeling knowledge) and awareness introspection (agents know what they are aware of).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show that the logic of speculative knowledge is as expressive as the logic of explicit knowledge, and the logic of implicit knowledge is more expressive than the two other logics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also present expressivity results for more restricted languages.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We then provide and compare axiomatizations for the three logics; the axiomatizations for speculative knowledge are novel.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We compare our results to those for awareness achieved in artificial intelligence, computer science, philosophy, and economics.</a>
