<a href="#0" id="0">Probabilistic logics combine the expressive power of logic with the ability to reason with uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Several probabilistic logic languages have been proposed in the past, each of them with their own features.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We focus on a class of probabilistic logic based on Sato's distribution semantics, which extends logic programming with probability distributions on binary random variables and guarantees a unique probability distribution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For many applications binary random variables are, however, not sufficient and one requires random variables with arbitrary ranges, e.g. real numbers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We tackle this problem by developing a generalised distribution semantics for a new probabilistic constraint logic programming language.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In order to perform exact inference, imprecise probabilities are taken as a starting point, i.e. we deal with sets of probability distributions rather than a single one.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It is shown that given any continuous distribution, conditional probabilities of events can be approximated arbitrarily close to the true probability.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Furthermore, for this setting an inference algorithm that is a generalisation of weighted model counting is developed, making use of SMT solvers.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We show that inference has similar complexity properties as precise probabilistic inference, unlike most imprecise methods for which inference is more complex.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We also experimentally confirm that our algorithm is able to exploit local structure, such as determinism, which further reduces the computational complexity.</a>
