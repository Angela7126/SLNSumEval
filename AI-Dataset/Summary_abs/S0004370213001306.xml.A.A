<a href="#0" id="0">Previous approaches to select agents to form a team rely on single-agent capabilities, and team performance is treated as a sum of such known capabilities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Motivated by complex team formation situations, we address the problem where both single-agent capabilities may not be known upfront, e.g., as in ad hoc teams, and where team performance goes beyond single-agent capabilities and depends on the specific synergy among agents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We formally introduce a novel weighted synergy graph model to capture new interactions among agents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Agents are represented as vertices in the graph, and their capabilities are represented as Normally-distributed variables.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The edges of the weighted graph represent how well the agents work together, i.e., their synergy in a team.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We contribute a learning algorithm that learns the weighted synergy graph using observations of performance of teams of only two and three agents.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Further, we contribute two team formation algorithms, one that finds the optimal team in exponential time, and one that approximates the optimal team in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We extensively evaluate our learning algorithm, and demonstrate the expressiveness of the weighted synergy graph in a variety of problems.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We show our approach in a rich ad hoc team formation problem capturing a rescue domain, namely the RoboCup Rescue domain, where simulated robots rescue civilians and put out fires in a simulated urban disaster.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We show that the weighted synergy graph outperforms a competing algorithm, thus illustrating the efficacy of our model and algorithms.</a>
