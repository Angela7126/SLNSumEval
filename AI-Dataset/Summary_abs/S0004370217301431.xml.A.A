<a href="#0" id="0">Planning in real world domains often involves modeling and reasoning about the duration of actions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Temporal planning allows such modeling and reasoning by looking for plans that specify start and end time points for each action.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In many practical cases, however, the duration of actions may be uncertain and not under the full control of the executor.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, a navigation task may take more or less time, depending on external conditions such as terrain or weather.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we tackle the problem of strong temporal planning with uncontrollable action durations (STPUD).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For actions with uncontrollable durations, the planner is only allowed to choose the start of the actions, while the end is chosen, within known bounds, by the environment.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A solution plan must be robust with respect to all uncontrollable action durations, and must achieve the goal on all executions, despite the choices of the environment.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We propose two complementary techniques.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">First, we discuss a dedicated planning method, that generalizes the state-space temporal planning framework, leveraging SMT-based techniques for temporal networks under uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Second, we present a compilation-based method, that reduces any STPUD problem to an ordinary temporal planning problem.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Moreover, we investigate a set of sufficient conditions to simplify domains by removing some of the uncontrollability.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We implemented both our approaches, and we experimentally evaluated our techniques on a large number of instances.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of the two techniques, which show complementary behavior.</a>
