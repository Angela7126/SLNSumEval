<a href="#0" id="0">Designing high-performance solvers for computationally hard problems is a difficult and often time-consuming task.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although such design problems are traditionally solved by the application of human expertise, we argue instead for the use of automatic methods.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this work, we consider the design of stochastic local search (SLS) solvers for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We first introduce a generalized, highly parameterized solver framework, dubbed SATenstein, that includes components drawn from or inspired by existing high-performance SLS algorithms for SAT.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The parameters of SATenstein determine which components are selected and how these components behave; they allow SATenstein to instantiate many high-performance solvers previously proposed in the literature, along with trillions of novel solver strategies.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We used an automated algorithm configuration procedure to find instantiations of SATenstein that perform well on several well-known, challenging distributions of SAT instances.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our experiments show that SATenstein solvers achieved dramatic performance improvements as compared to the previous state of the art in SLS algorithms; for many benchmark distributions, our new solvers also significantly outperformed all automatically tuned variants of previous state-of-the-art algorithms.</a>
