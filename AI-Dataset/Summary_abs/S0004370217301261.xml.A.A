<a href="#0" id="0">The obvious way to use several admissible heuristics in searching for an optimal solution is to take their maximum.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we aim to reduce the time spent on computing heuristics within the context of A⁎ and IDA⁎.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We discuss Lazy A⁎ and Lazy IDA⁎, variants of A⁎ and IDA⁎, respectively, where heuristics are evaluated lazily: only when they are essential to a decision to be made in the search process.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While these lazy algorithms outperform naive maximization, we can do even better by intelligently deciding when to compute the more expensive heuristic.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We present a new rational metareasoning based scheme which decides whether to compute the more expensive heuristics at all, based on a myopic regret estimate.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This scheme is used to create rational lazy A⁎ and rational lazy IDA⁎.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also present different methods for estimating the parameters necessary for making such decisions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">An empirical evaluation in several domains supports the theoretical results, and shows that the rational variants, rational lazy A⁎ and rational lazy IDA⁎, are better than their non-rational counterparts.</a>
