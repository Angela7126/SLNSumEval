<a href="#0" id="0">Online spatio-temporal matching of servers/services to customers is a problem that arises at a large scale in many domains associated with shared transportation (e.g., taxis, ride sharing, super shuttles, etc.)</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">and delivery services (e.g., food, equipment, clothing, home fuel, etc.).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A key characteristic of these problems is that the matching of servers/services to customers in one stage has a direct impact on the matching in the next stage.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For instance, it is efficient for taxis to pick up customers closer to the drop off point of the customer from the first stage of matching.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Traditionally, greedy/myopic approaches have been adopted to address such large scale online matching problems.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">While they provide solutions in a scalable manner, due to their myopic nature, the quality of matching obtained can be improved significantly (demonstrated in our experimental results).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this paper, we present a multi-stage stochastic optimization formulation to consider potential future demand scenarios (obtained from past data).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We then provide an enhancement to solve large scale problems more effectively and efficiently online.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We also provide the worst-case theoretical bounds on the performance of different approaches.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we demonstrate the significant improvement provided by our techniques over myopic approaches and two other multi-stage approaches from literature (Approximate Dynamic Programming and Hybrid Multi-Stage Stochastic optimization formulation) on three real world taxi data sets.</a>
