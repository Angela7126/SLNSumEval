<a href="#0" id="0">Levesque introduced the notion of “only knowing” to precisely capture the beliefs of a knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">He also showed how only knowing can be used to formalize nonmonotonic behavior within a monotonic logic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Levesque's logic only deals with a single agent, and therefore, a number of attempts have been made to generalize only knowing to the many agent case.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, all these attempts have some undesirable features.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Most significantly, these attempts are propositional and it is not clear how they are to be extended to the first-order case.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this work, we propose a new semantical account of multiagent only knowing which, for the first time, has a natural possible-world semantics for a quantified language with equality.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Among other things, properties about Levesque's logic generalize faithfully to the many agent case with this account.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the propositional fragment, we also provide a sound and complete axiomatization.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, we obtain a multiagent first-order version of the nonmonotonicity exhibited by the logic of only knowing.</a>
