<a href="#0" id="0">This article reviews legal applications of logic, with a particularly marked concern for logical models of legal argument.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We argue that the law is a rich test bed and important application field for logic-based AI research.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First applications of logic to the representation of legal regulations are reviewed, where the main emphasis is on representation and where the legal conclusions follow from that representation as a matter of deduction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This includes the representation of deontic concepts, normative positions, legal ontologies, time and change.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then legal applications of logic are reviewed where legal rules are not just applied but are the object of reasoning and discourse.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This includes arguing about applying statutory rules in unforeseen circumstances, interpretative reasoning in light of the facts of a case, and evidential reasoning to establish the facts of a case.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This part of the review has special emphasis on argumentation-based approaches.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This also holds for the final part, which discusses formal models of legal procedure and of multi-agent interaction in legal proceedings.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The review concludes with identifying some of the main open research problems.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The review shows that modern legal applications of logic confirm the recent trend of widening the scope of logic from deduction to information flow, argumentation and interaction.</a>
