<a href="#0" id="0">In recent years, discriminative methods have achieved much progress in natural language processing tasks, such as parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and word segmentation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For these methods, conventional features in a relatively high dimensional feature space may suffer from sparseness and thus exhibit less discriminative power on unseen data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This article presents a learning framework of feature transformation, addressing the sparseness problem by transforming sparse conventional base features into less sparse high-level features (i.e. meta features) with the help of a large amount of automatically annotated data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The meta features are derived by bucketing similar base features according to the frequency in large data, and used together with base features in our final system.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We apply the framework to part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Experimental results show that our systems perform better than the baseline systems in both tasks on standard evaluation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For the dependency parsing task, our parsers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the Chinese data and comparable accuracy with the best known systems on the English data.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Further analysis indicates that our proposed approach is effective in processing unseen data and features.</a>
