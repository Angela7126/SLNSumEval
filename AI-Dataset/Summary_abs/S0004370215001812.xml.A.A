<a href="#0" id="0">In many real-world settings, the structure of the environment constrains the formation of coalitions among agents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These settings can be represented by characteristic function games, also known as coalitional games, equipped with interaction graphs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An interaction graph determines the set of all feasible coalitions, in that a coalition C can form only if the subgraph induced over the nodes/agents in C is connected.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our work analyzes stability issues arising in such environments, by focusing on the core as a solution concept, and by considering the coalition structure viewpoint, that is, without assuming that the grand-coalition necessarily forms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The complexity of the coalition structure core is studied over a variety of interaction graph structures of interest, including complete graphs, lines, cycles, trees, and nearly-acyclic graphs (formally, having bounded treewidth).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The related stability concepts of the least core and the cost of stability are also studied.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Results are derived for the setting of compact coalitional games, i.e., for games that are implicitly described via a compact encoding, and where simple calculations on this encoding are to be performed in order to compute the payoff associated with any coalition.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Moreover, specific results are provided for compact games defined via marginal contribution networks, an expressive encoding mechanism that received considerable attention in the last few years.</a>
