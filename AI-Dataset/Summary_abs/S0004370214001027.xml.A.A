<a href="#0" id="0">Knowledge representation and reasoning using propositional logic is an important component of AI systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A propositional formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) may contain redundant clauses â€” clauses whose removal from the formula does not affect the set of its models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Identification of redundant clauses is important because redundancy often leads to unnecessary computation, wasted storage, and may obscure the structure of the problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A formula obtained by the removal of all redundant clauses from a given CNF formula F is called a Minimal Equivalent Subformula (MES) of F. This paper proposes a number of efficient algorithms and optimization techniques for the computation of MESes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Previous work on MES computation proposes a simple algorithm based on iterative application of the definition of a redundant clause, similar to the well-known deletion-based approach for the computation of Minimal Unsatisfiable Subformulas (MUSes).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This paper observes that, in fact, most of the existing algorithms for the computation of MUSes can be adapted to the computation of MESes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, some of the optimization techniques that are crucial for the performance of the state-of-the-art MUS extractors cannot be applied in the context of MES computation, and thus the resulting algorithms are often not efficient in practice.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">To address the problem of efficient computation of MESes, the paper develops a new class of algorithms that are based on the iterative analysis of subsets of clauses, and a lightweight pruning technique based on the computation of backbones.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The experimental results, obtained on representative problem instances, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The experimental results also reveal that many CNF instances obtained from the practical applications of SAT exhibit a large degree of redundancy.</a>
