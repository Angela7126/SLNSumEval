<a href="#0" id="0">We study the problem of rewriting a Disjunctive Datalog program into an equivalent plain Datalog program (i.e., one that entails the same facts for every dataset).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show that a Disjunctive Datalog program is Datalog rewritable if and only if it can be rewritten into a linear program (i.e., having at most one IDB body atom in each rule), thus providing a novel characterisation of Datalog rewritability in terms of linearisability.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Motivated by this result, we propose the class of markable programs, which extends both Datalog and linear Disjunctive Datalog and admits Datalog rewritings of polynomial size.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We show that our results can be seamlessly applied to ontological reasoning and identify two classes of non-Horn ontologies that admit Datalog rewritings of polynomial and exponential size, respectively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, we shift our attention to conjunctive query answering and extend our results to the problem of computing a rewriting of a Disjunctive Datalog program that yields the same answers to a given query w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">arbitrary data.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our empirical results suggest that a fair number of non-Horn ontologies are Datalog rewritable and that query answering over such ontologies becomes feasible using a Datalog engine.</a>
