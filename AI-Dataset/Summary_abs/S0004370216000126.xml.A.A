<a href="#0" id="0">One of the biggest challenges in the design of real-world decision support systems is coming up with a good combinatorial optimization model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Often enough, accurate predictive models (e.g. simulators) can be devised, but they are too complex or too slow to be employed in combinatorial optimization.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we propose a methodology called Empirical Model Learning (EML) that relies on Machine Learning for obtaining components of a prescriptive model, using data either extracted from a predictive model or harvested from a real system.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In a way, EML can be considered as a technique to merge predictive and prescriptive analytics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">All models introduce some form of approximation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Citing G.E.P.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Box [1] “Essentially, all models are wrong, but some of them are useful”.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In EML, models are useful if they provide adequate accuracy, and if they can be effectively exploited by solvers for finding high-quality solutions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We show how to ground EML on a case study of thermal-aware workload dispatching.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We use two learning methods, namely Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Trees and we show how to encapsulate the learned model in a number of optimization techniques, namely Local Search, Constraint Programming, Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming and SAT Modulo Theories.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EML approach by comparing our results with those obtained using expert-designed models.</a>
