<a href="#0" id="0">Active integrity constraints (AICs) constitute a formalism to associate with a database not just the constraints it should adhere to, but also how to fix the database in case one or more of these constraints are violated.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The intuitions regarding which repairs are “good” given such a description are closely related to intuitions that live in various areas of non-monotonic reasoning, such as logic programming and autoepistemic logic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we apply approximation fixpoint theory, an abstract, algebraic framework designed to unify semantics of non-monotonic logics, to the field of AICs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This results in a new family of semantics for AICs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We study properties of our new semantics and relationships to existing semantics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In particular, we argue that two of the newly defined semantics stand out.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Grounded repairs have a simple definition that is purely based on semantic principles that semantics for AICs should adhere to.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">And, as we show, they coincide with the intended interpretation of AICs on many examples.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The second semantics of interest is the AFT-well-founded semantics: it is a computationally cheap semantics that provides upper and lower bounds for many other classes of repairs.</a>
