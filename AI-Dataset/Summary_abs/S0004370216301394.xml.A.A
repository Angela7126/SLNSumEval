<a href="#0" id="0">A common problem in disciplines of applied Statistics research such as Astrostatistics is of estimating the posterior distribution of relevant parameters.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Typically, the likelihoods for such models are computed via expensive experiments such as cosmological simulations of the universe.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we study active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Via experiments on a series of synthetic and real examples we demonstrate that our approach is significantly more query efficient than existing techniques and other heuristics for posterior estimation.</a>
