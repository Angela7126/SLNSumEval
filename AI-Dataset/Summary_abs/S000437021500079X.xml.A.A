<a href="#0" id="0">In recent years the notion of portfolio has been revived with the aim of improving the performance of modern solvers.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, Fast Downward Stone Soup and SATzilla have shown an excellent performance at the International Planning and SAT Competitions respectively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, a deeper understanding of the limits and possibilities of portfolios is still missing.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Most approaches to the study of portfolios are purely empirical.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, we propose a theoretically-grounded method based on Mixed-Integer Programming named gop.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It addresses, among others, three main issues: how to derive an upper bound on the solvers performance for a given set of problem solving tasks; how to analyze the utility of training instances when designing portfolios; and how to configure a high performance portfolio for a given training set which generalizes very well on unseen instances.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Experimental results both with data from the International Planning Competitions 2008 and 2011 and the SAT Competition 2013 show that this approach significantly outperforms others under the same conditions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Indeed, MIPSat, the sequential SAT portfolio automatically configured with gop, won the silver medal in the Open track of the SAT Competition 2013.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In addition, MIPlan, the planning system which is able to automatically generate a portfolio configuration for a specific planning domain using gop, won the learning track of the International Planning Competition 2014.</a>
