<a href="#0" id="0">While propositional logic is widely used as a representation framework for many AI applications, the concept of language independence in the propositional setting has not received much attention so far.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we define language independence for a propositional operator as robustness w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">symbol translation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We motivate the need to focus on symbol translations of restricted types, introduce and study several families of translations of interest, and provide a number of characterization results.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also identify the computational complexity of recognizing symbol translations from those families.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then we investigate the robustness of belief merging, belief revision and belief update operators w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">translations of different types.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It turns out that some rational merging/revision/update operators are not guaranteed to offer the most basic (yet non-trivial) form of language independence.</a>
