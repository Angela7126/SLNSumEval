<a href="#0" id="0">Election control encompasses attempts from an external agent to alter the structure of an election in order to change its outcome.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This problem is both a fundamental theoretical problem in social choice, and a major practical concern for democratic institutions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consequently, this issue has received considerable attention, particularly as it pertains to different voting rules.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast, the problem of how election control can be prevented or deterred has been largely ignored.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We introduce the problem of optimal defense against election control, including destructive and constructive control, where manipulation is allowed at the granularity of groups of voters (e.g., voting locations) through a denial-of-service attack, and the defender allocates limited protection resources to prevent control.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We consider plurality voting, and show that it is computationally hard to prevent both types of control, though destructive control itself can be performed in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For defense against destructive control, we present a double-oracle framework for computing an optimal prevention strategy.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We show that both defender and attacker best response subproblems are NP-complete, and develop exact mixed-integer linear programming approaches for solving these, as well as fast heuristic methods.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We then extend this general approach to develop effective algorithmic solutions for defense against constructive control.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we generalize the model and algorithmic approaches to consider uncertainty about voter preferences.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed computational framework can scale to realistic problem instances.1</a>
