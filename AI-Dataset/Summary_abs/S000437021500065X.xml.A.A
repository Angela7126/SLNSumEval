<a href="#0" id="0">Data mining is the study of how to extract information from data and express it as useful knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">One of its most important subfields, pattern mining, involves searching and enumerating interesting patterns in data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Various aspects of pattern mining are studied in the theory of computation and statistics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the last decade, the pattern mining community has witnessed a sharp shift from efficiency-based approaches to methods which can extract more meaningful patterns.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Recently, new methods adapting results from studies of economic efficiency and multi-criteria decision analyses such as Pareto efficiency, or skylines, have been studied.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Within pattern mining, this novel line of research allows the easy expression of preferences according to a dominance relation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This approach is useful from a user-preference point of view and tends to promote the use of pattern mining algorithms for non-experts.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We present a significant extension of our previous work [1], [2] on the discovery of skyline patterns (or “skypatterns”) based on the theoretical relationships with condensed representations of patterns.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We show how these relationships facilitate the computation of skypatterns and we exploit them to propose a flexible and efficient approach to mine skypatterns using a dynamic constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) framework.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We present a unified methodology of our different approaches towards the same goal.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This work is supported by an extensive experimental study allowing us to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.</a>
