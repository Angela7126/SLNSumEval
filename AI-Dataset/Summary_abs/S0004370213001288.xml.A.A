<a href="#0" id="0">Many electoral control and manipulation problems—which we will refer to in general as “manipulative actions” problems—are NP-hard in the general case.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It has recently been noted that many of these problems fall into polynomial time if the electorate is single-peaked, i.e., is polarized along some axis/issue.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, real-world electorates are not truly single-peaked.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">There are usually some mavericks, and so real-world electorates tend merely to be nearly single-peaked.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This paper studies the complexity of manipulative-action algorithms for elections over nearly single-peaked electorates.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We do this for many notions of nearness and for a broad range of election systems.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We provide instances where even one maverick jumps the manipulative-action complexity up to NP-hardness, but we also provide many instances where some number of mavericks can be tolerated without increasing the manipulative-action complexity.</a>
