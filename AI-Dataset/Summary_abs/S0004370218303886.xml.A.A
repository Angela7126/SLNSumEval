<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we advance the state-of-the-art on the application of second-order propositional modal logic (SOPML) in the representation of individual and group knowledge, as well as temporal and spatial reasoning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The main theoretical contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Firstly, we introduce the language of (multi-modal) SOPML and interpret it on a variety of different classes of Kripke frames according to the features of the accessibility relations and of the algebraic structure of the quantification domain of propositions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We provide axiomatisations for some of these classes, and show that SOPML is unaxiomatisable on the remaining classes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Secondly, we introduce novel notions of (bi)simulations and prove that they indeed preserve the interpretation of formulas in (the universal fragment of) SOPML.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, we apply this formal machinery to study the expressiveness of Second-order Propositional Epistemic Logic (SOPEL) in representing higher-order knowledge, i.e., the knowledge agents have about other agents' knowledge, as well as graph-theoretic notions (e.g., 3-colorability, Hamiltonian paths, etc.)</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The final outcome is a rich formalism to represent and reason about relevant concepts in artificial intelligence, while still having a model checking problem that is no more computationally expensive than that of the less expressive quantified boolean logic.</a>
