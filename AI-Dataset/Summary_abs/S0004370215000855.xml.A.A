<a href="#0" id="0">This paper proposes a generic approach to planning in the presence of incomplete information.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The approach builds on an abstract notion of a belief state representation, along with an associated set of basic operations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These operations facilitate the development of a sound and complete transition function, for reasoning about effects of actions in the presence of incomplete information, and a set of abstract algorithms for planning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The paper demonstrates how the abstract definitions and algorithms can be instantiated in three concrete representations—minimal-DNF, minimal-CNF, and prime implicates—resulting in three highly competitive conformant planners: Dnf, Cnf, and PIP.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The paper relates the notion of a representation to that of ordered binary decision diagrams, a well-known belief state representation employed by many conformant planners, and several target compilation languages that have been presented in the literature.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The paper also includes an experimental evaluation of the planners Dnf, Cnf, and PIP and proposes a new set of conformant planning benchmarks that are challenging for state-of-the-art conformant planners.</a>
