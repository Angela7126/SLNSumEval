<a href="#0" id="0">Patients with epilepsy can manifest short, sub-clinical epileptic “bursts” in addition to full-blown clinical seizures.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We believe the relationship between these two classes of events—something not previously studied quantitatively—could yield important insights into the nature and intrinsic dynamics of seizures.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A goal of our work is to parse these complex epileptic events into distinct dynamic regimes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A challenge posed by the intracranial EEG (iEEG) data we study is the fact that the number and placement of electrodes can vary between patients.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We develop a Bayesian nonparametric Markov switching process that allows for (i) shared dynamic regimes between a variable number of channels, (ii) asynchronous regime-switching, and (iii) an unknown dictionary of dynamic regimes.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We encode a sparse and changing set of dependencies between the channels using a Markov-switching Gaussian graphical model for the innovations process driving the channel dynamics and demonstrate the importance of this model in parsing and out-of-sample predictions of iEEG data.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show that our model produces intuitive state assignments that can help automate clinical analysis of seizures and enable the comparison of sub-clinical bursts and full clinical seizures.</a>
