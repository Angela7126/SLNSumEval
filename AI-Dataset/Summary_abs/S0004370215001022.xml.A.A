<a href="#0" id="0">Integration of the fields of constraint solving and data mining and machine learning has recently been identified within the AI community as an important research direction with high potential.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This work contributes to this direction by providing a first study on the applicability of state-of-the-art Boolean optimization procedures to cost-optimal correlation clustering under constraints in a general similarity-based setting.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We develop exact formulations of the correlation clustering task as Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), the optimization version of the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For obtaining cost-optimal clusterings, we apply a state-of-the-art MaxSAT solver for solving the resulting MaxSAT instances optimally, resulting in cost-optimal clusterings.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We experimentally evaluate the MaxSAT-based approaches to cost-optimal correlation clustering, both on the scalability of our method and the quality of the clusterings obtained.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, we show how the approach extends to constrained correlation clustering, where additional user knowledge is imposed as constraints on the optimal clusterings of interest.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show experimentally that added user knowledge allows clustering larger datasets, and at the same time tends to decrease the running time of our approach.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also investigate the effects of MaxSAT-level preprocessing, symmetry breaking, and the choice of the MaxSAT solver on the efficiency of the approach.</a>
