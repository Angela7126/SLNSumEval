<a href="#0" id="0">This research note contains an extension of a previous work by Cabalar and Santos (2011) that formalised several spatial puzzles formed by strings and holes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That approach explicitly ignored some configurations and actions that were irrelevant for the studied puzzles but are physically possible and may become crucial for other spatial reasoning problems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, the previous work did not consider the formation of string loops or the situations where a holed object is partially crossed by another holed object.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we remove these limitations by treating string loops as dynamic holes that can be created or destroyed by a pair of elementary actions, respectively picking or pulling from strings.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We explain how string loops can be recognised in a data structure representing the domain states and define a notation to represent crossings through string loops.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The resulting formalism is dual in the sense that it also allows understanding any hole as a kind of (sometimes rigid) closed string loop.</a>
