<a href="#0" id="0">As an important tool for behavior informatics, negative sequential patterns (NSP) (such as missing medical treatments) are critical and sometimes much more informative than positive sequential patterns (PSP) (e.g. using a medical service) in many intelligent systems and applications such as intelligent transport systems, healthcare and risk management, as they often involve non-occurring but interesting behaviors.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, discovering NSP is much more difficult than identifying PSP due to the significant problem complexity caused by non-occurring elements, high computational cost and huge search space in calculating negative sequential candidates (NSC).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">So far, the problem has not been formalized well, and very few approaches have been proposed to mine for specific types of NSP, which rely on database re-scans after identifying PSP in order to calculate the NSC supports.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This has been shown to be very inefficient or even impractical, since the NSC search space is usually huge.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This paper proposes a very innovative and efficient theoretical framework: set theory-based NSP mining (ST-NSP), and a corresponding algorithm, e-NSP, to efficiently identify NSP by involving only the identified PSP, without re-scanning the database.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Accordingly, negative containment is first defined to determine whether a data sequence contains a negative sequence based on set theory.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Second, an efficient approach is proposed to convert the negative containment problem to a positive containment problem.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The NSC supports are then calculated based only on the corresponding PSP.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This not only avoids the need for additional database scans, but also enables the use of existing PSP mining algorithms to mine for NSP.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, a simple but efficient strategy is proposed to generate NSC.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Theoretical analyses show that e-NSP performs particularly well on datasets with a small number of elements in a sequence, a large number of itemsets and low minimum support.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">e-NSP is compared with two currently available NSP mining algorithms via intensive experiments on three synthetic and six real-life datasets from aspects including data characteristics, computational costs and scalability.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">e-NSP is tens to thousands of times faster than baseline approaches, and offers a sound and effective approach for efficient mining of NSP in large scale datasets by directly using existing PSP mining algorithms.</a>
