<a href="#0" id="0">The answer set semantics presented by Faber et al. [27] has been widely used to define so called FLP answer sets for different types of logic programs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, it was recently observed that when being extended from normal to more general classes of logic programs, this approach may produce answer sets with circular justifications that are caused by self-supporting loops.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The main reason for this behavior is that the FLP answer set semantics is not fully constructive by a bottom up construction of answer sets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we overcome this problem by enhancing the FLP answer set semantics with a level mapping formalism such that every answer set I can be built by fixpoint iteration of a one-step provability operator (more precisely, an extended van Emden–Kowalski operator for the FLP reduct fΠI).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is inspired by the fact that under the standard answer set semantics, each answer set I of a normal logic program Π is obtainable by fixpoint iteration of the standard van Emden–Kowalski one-step provability operator for the Gelfond–Lifschitz reduct ΠI, which induces a level mapping.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The enhanced FLP answer sets, which we call well-justified FLP answer sets, are thanks to the level mapping free of circular justifications.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As a general framework, the well-justified FLP answer set semantics applies to logic programs with first-order formulas, logic programs with aggregates, description logic programs, hex-programs etc., provided that the rule satisfaction is properly extended to such general logic programs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We study in depth the computational complexity of FLP and well-justified FLP answer sets for general classes of logic programs.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our results show that the level mapping does not increase the worst-case complexity of FLP answer sets.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Furthermore, we describe an implementation of the well-justified FLP answer set semantics, and report about an experimental evaluation, which indicates a potential for performance improvements by the level mapping in practice.</a>
