<a href="#0" id="0">We investigate manipulation of the Borda voting rule, as well as two elimination style voting rules, Nanson's and Baldwin's voting rules, which are based on Borda voting.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We argue that these rules have a number of desirable computational properties.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For unweighted Borda voting, we prove that it is NP-hard for a coalition of two manipulators to compute a manipulation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This resolves a long-standing open problem in the computational complexity of manipulating common voting rules.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We prove that manipulation of Baldwin's and Nanson's rules is computationally more difficult than manipulation of Borda, as it is NP-hard for a single manipulator to compute a manipulation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In addition, for Baldwin's and Nanson's rules with weighted votes, we prove that it is NP-hard for a coalition of manipulators to compute a manipulation with a small number of candidates.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Because of these NP-hardness results, we compute manipulations using heuristic algorithms that attempt to minimise the number of manipulators.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We propose several new heuristic methods.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Experiments show that these methods significantly outperform the previously best known heuristic method for the Borda rule.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Our results suggest that, whilst computing a manipulation of the Borda rule is NP-hard, computational complexity may provide only a weak barrier against manipulation in practice.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In contrast to the Borda rule, our experiments with Baldwin's and Nanson's rules demonstrate that both of them are often more difficult to manipulate in practice.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">These results suggest that elimination style voting rules deserve further study.</a>
