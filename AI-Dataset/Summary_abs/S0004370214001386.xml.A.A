<a href="#0" id="0">In the multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF) we are given a set of agents each with respective start and goal positions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The task is to find paths for all agents while avoiding collisions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Most previous work on solving this problem optimally has treated the individual agents as a single ‘joint agent’ and then applied single-agent search variants of the A* algorithm.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper we present the Conflict Based Search (CBS) a new optimal multi-agent pathfinding algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">CBS is a two-level algorithm that does not convert the problem into the single ‘joint agent’ model.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">At the high level, a search is performed on a Conflict Tree (CT) which is a tree based on conflicts between individual agents.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Each node in the CT represents a set of constraints on the motion of the agents.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">At the low level, fast single-agent searches are performed to satisfy the constraints imposed by the high level CT node.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In many cases this two-level formulation enables CBS to examine fewer states than A* while still maintaining optimality.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We analyze CBS and show its benefits and drawbacks.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Additionally we present the Meta-Agent CBS (MA-CBS) algorithm.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">MA-CBS is a generalization of CBS.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Unlike basic CBS, MA-CBS is not restricted to single-agent searches at the low level.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Instead, MA-CBS allows agents to be merged into small groups of joint agents.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This mitigates some of the drawbacks of basic CBS and further improves performance.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In fact, MA-CBS is a framework that can be built on top of any optimal and complete MAPF solver in order to enhance its performance.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Experimental results on various problems show a speedup of up to an order of magnitude over previous approaches.</a>
