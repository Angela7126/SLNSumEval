<a href="#0" id="0">This paper investigates manipulation of multiple unknown objects in a crowded environment.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Because of incomplete knowledge due to unknown objects and occlusions in visual observations, object observations are imperfect and action success is uncertain, making planning challenging.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which allows a general reward based optimization objective and takes uncertainty in temporal evolution and partial observations into account.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition to occlusion dependent observation and action success probabilities, our POMDP model also automatically adapts object specific action success probabilities.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To cope with the changing system dynamics and performance constraints, we present a new online POMDP method based on particle filtering that produces compact policies.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The approach is validated both in simulation and in physical experiments in a scenario of moving dirty dishes into a dishwasher.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The results indicate that: 1) a greedy heuristic manipulation approach is not sufficient, multi-object manipulation requires multi-step POMDP planning, and 2) on-line planning is beneficial since it allows the adaptation of the system dynamics model based on actual experience.</a>
