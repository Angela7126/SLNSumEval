<a href="#0" id="0">We consider partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with a set of target states and an integer cost associated with every transition.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The optimization objective we study asks to minimize the expected total cost of reaching a state in the target set, while ensuring that the target set is reached almost surely (with probability 1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that for integer costs approximating the optimal cost is undecidable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For positive costs, our results are as follows: (i) we establish matching lower and upper bounds for the optimal cost, both double exponential in the POMDP state space size; (ii) we show that the problem of approximating the optimal cost is decidable and present approximation algorithms developing on the existing algorithms for POMDPs with finite-horizon objectives.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While the worst-case running time of our algorithm is double exponential, we also present efficient stopping criteria for the algorithm and show experimentally that it performs well in many examples of interest.</a>
