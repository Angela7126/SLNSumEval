<a href="#0" id="0">We consider the discrete assignment problem in which agents express ordinal preferences over objects and these objects are allocated to the agents in a fair manner.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We use the stochastic dominance relation between fractional or randomized allocations to systematically define varying notions of proportionality and envy-freeness for discrete assignments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The computational complexity of checking whether a fair assignment exists is studied for these fairness notions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also characterize the conditions under which a fair assignment is guaranteed to exist.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For a number of fairness concepts, polynomial-time algorithms are presented to check whether a fair assignment exists.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our algorithmic results also extend to the case of unequal entitlements of agents.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our NP-hardness result, which holds for several variants of envy-freeness, answers an open question posed by Bouveret, Endriss, and Lang (ECAI 2010).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also propose fairness concepts that always suggest a non-empty set of assignments with meaningful fairness properties.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Among these concepts, optimal proportionality and optimal weak proportionality appear to be desirable fairness concepts.</a>
