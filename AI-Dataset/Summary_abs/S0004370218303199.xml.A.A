<a href="#0" id="0">We study a setting where Electric Vehicles (EVs) can be hired to drive from pick-up to drop-off points in a Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) scheme.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The goal of the system is, either to maximize the number of customers that are serviced, or the total EV utilization.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To do so, we characterise the optimisation problem as a max-flow problem in order to determine the set of feasible trips given the available EVs at each location.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We then model and solve the EV-to-trip scheduling problem offline and optimally using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) techniques and show that the solution scales up to medium sized problems.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given this, we develop two non-optimal algorithms, namely an incremental-MIP algorithm for medium to large problems and a greedy heuristic algorithm for very large problems.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Moreover, we develop a tabu search-based local search technique to further improve upon and compare against the solution of the non-optimal algorithms.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We study the performance of these algorithms in settings where either battery swap or battery charge at each station is used to cope with the EVs' limited driving range.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Moreover, in settings where EVs need to be scheduled online, we propose a novel algorithm that accounts for the uncertainty in future trip requests.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">All algorithms are empirically evaluated using real-world data of locations of shared vehicle pick-up and drop-off stations.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In our experiments, we observe that when all EVs carry the same battery which is large enough for the longest trips, the greedy algorithm with battery swap with the max-flow solution as a pre-processing step, provides the optimal solution.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">At the same time, the greedy algorithm with battery charge is close to the optimal (97% on average) and is further improved when local search is used.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">When some EVs do not have a large enough battery to execute some of the longest trips, the incremental-MIP generates solutions slightly better than the greedy, while the optimal algorithm is the best but scales up to medium sized problems only.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Moreover, the online algorithm is shown to be on average at least 90% of the optimal.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Finally, the greedy algorithm scales to 10-times more tasks than the incremental-MIP and 1000-times more than the static MIP in reasonable time.</a>
