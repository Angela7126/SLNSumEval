<a href="#0" id="0">The structure of social relations is fundamental for the construction of plausible simulation scenarios.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It shapes the way actors interact and create their identity within overlapping social contexts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each actor interacts in multiple contexts within different types of social relations that constitute their social space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this article, we present an approach to model structured agent societies with multiple coexisting social networks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We study the notion of context permeability, using a game in which agents try to achieve global consensus.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We design and analyse two different models of permeability.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the first model, agents interact concurrently in multiple social networks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the second, we introduce a context switching mechanism which adds a dynamic temporal component to agent interaction in the model.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Agents switch between the different networks spending more or less time in each one.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We compare these models and analyse the influence of different social networks regarding the speed of convergence to consensus.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We conduct a series of experiments that show the impact of different configurations for coexisting social networks.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This approach unveils both the limitations of the current modelling approaches and possible research directions for complex social space simulations.</a>
