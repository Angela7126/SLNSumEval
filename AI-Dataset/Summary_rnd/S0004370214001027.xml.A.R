<a href="#1" id="1">A variety of techniques exist to speed up backbone computation [71].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, create a clause {a mathematical formula}(⋁ui∈Uui).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let{a mathematical formula}RF(E)be the group-CNF formula{a mathematical formula}D⁎∪Gi1∪…∪Gik, where{a mathematical formula}D⁎=D∪CNF(¬(F∖D))is the don't care group.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A key advantage of this reduction is that it enables clause set refinement.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}E⊨F if and only {a mathematical formula}E∧¬F is unsatisfiable.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Next, a reduction from MES to group-MUS formulation [25], [22] is developed, which enables the use of both model rotation and clause set refinement.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Hence, clause set refinement serves to eliminate all of the remaining groups of clauses, and so the MES is computed with two SAT solver calls.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Although in some settings redundancy in a formula might be desirable, in many others it is not.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As an illustrative example, consider the pseudo-code of the deletion-based group-MES extraction algorithm presented in Algorithm 5 and contrast it with the deletion-based algorithm for plain MES computation problem (Algorithm 1).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The extension of the MES algorithms to the group-MES computation problem proposed in this paper could enable the identification and the removal of redundant constraints in other domains, such as CSP [16], [17], [18], SMT [19], and Ontologies [20].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Such techniques include clause set trimming (during preprocessing), clause set refinement and model rotation[21], [22], [23], [24].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This condition corresponds to testing the satisfiability of the following CNF formula:{a mathematical formula} Clearly, the resulting instances of SAT are expected to be hard to solve, given the disjunction and the negation of formulas in (2).</a>
