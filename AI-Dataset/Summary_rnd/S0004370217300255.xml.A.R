<a href="#0" id="0">Informally, {a mathematical formula}ψ∈Cn∧{φ} if ψ is a conjunct of φ. For instance, if {a mathematical formula}Γ={x1∧x2∧x3}, {a mathematical formula}Cn∧(Γ)={x1,x2,x3,x1∧x2,x2∧x3,x1∧x2∧x3}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In principle, there could be a weaker version of (Dominance′) that holds for {a mathematical formula}IMIS.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}I:K→[0,∞)∪{∞} be an inconsistency measure:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Define {a mathematical formula}Δ′=⋃ψ∈Δf(ψ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">How “controversial” is {a mathematical formula}x1?</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Nevertheless, note that φ is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}φ∧ψ in his objection, and thus it does not seem reasonable that {a mathematical formula}I(Γ∪{φ∧ψ})>I(Γ∪{φ}).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given an inconsistent knowledge base (a set of formulas), natural questions that arise are “where is the inconsistency?” and “how severe is it?”.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For {a mathematical formula}Cn⋆=Cn, ⋆-CONSEQUENCE is in {a mathematical formula}coNP⊆Σ2p∩Π2p, as {a mathematical formula}φ∈Cn(Γ) iff {a mathematical formula}Γ∪{¬φ} is unsatisfiable.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider the base {a mathematical formula}Γ={¬s∧¬g,(s∨m)∧g,¬m} from Example 3.3.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">⋆-FREE is the language formed by the pairs {a mathematical formula}〈φ,Γ〉∈L×K such that φ is ⋆-free in Γ.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A ⋆-conflict whose corresponding (⋆-Independence) is satisfied by {a mathematical formula}IDalalsum and {a mathematical formula}IDalalmax can be constructed via analysing the underlying consolidation procedure of the measures.</a>
