<a href="#0" id="0">We could indeed initialize Conacq with a bias containing only constraints for which we know efficient propagators, and let it interact with the user's model instead of the user directly.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then,{a mathematical formula}Consider a representation {a mathematical formula}C=φ(I) such that {a mathematical formula}I∈models(T) but {a mathematical formula}fC∉CB(E).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In Example 13, we found a sequence of optimal-in-expectation queries for establishing convergence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This justifies our slightly non-standard definition of constraint network.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Once a given α selected (or α still being the empty set), the loop necessarily executes one of the lines 9, 10, 15, or 17.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given a set {a mathematical formula}C of constraint networks, {a mathematical formula}φ−1(C) denotes the set of characteristic models of the networks in {a mathematical formula}C.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The query generation process is implemented by the function QueryGeneration, which takes as input the bias B, the current clausal theory T, the given background knowledge K, the current set of nogoods N, and the given strategy Strategy.</a>
