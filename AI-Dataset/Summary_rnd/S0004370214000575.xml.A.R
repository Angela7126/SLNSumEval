<a href="#1" id="1">Many have extended the basic mechanism to support various variants of the model, such as asymmetric costs, heterogeneously repeating instances and other factors [67].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using such reservation values, would have precluded any search on behalf of the agent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this problem, a single agent can explore one or more opportunities in any period, where the cost of exploring {a mathematical formula}k′ opportunities is given by some monotonically increasing function {a mathematical formula}C(k′).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The explanation for the phenomena is that when the agents are self-interested they might prefer to limit their individual search efforts while counting on potential findings of others.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These works, however, assume that one agent's search process is constrained by the findings of the other agents, rather than augmented/improved by such findings as in our case.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(5) is valid only if it is beneficial for the agent to conduct the search, as it captures the indifference between the cost of search and the gain obtained from it.</a>
