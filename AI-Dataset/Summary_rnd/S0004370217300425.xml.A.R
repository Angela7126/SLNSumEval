<a href="#0" id="0">This convergence can be interpreted as the continuity of the thick function {a mathematical formula}〚f〛([x]) around intervals {a mathematical formula}[x] which are degenerated (i.e., the box {a mathematical formula}[x] is a singleton).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Fig. 1 (left) corresponds to the result of a paver based on these two tests (see the Set Inversion algorithm recalled at Subsection 4.1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The meet operator corresponds to the intersection and the join to the union.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the thick case, we have a thick function {a mathematical formula}[f] from {a mathematical formula}Rn to {a mathematical formula}IRm and a thick set {a mathematical formula}〚Y〛∈IP(Rn).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Test-case 4.Communication area.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As illustrated by Fig. 6, the thick box {a mathematical formula}〚f〛([x]) encloses the set of all boxes {a mathematical formula}[f](a) with {a mathematical formula}a∈[x].</a>
