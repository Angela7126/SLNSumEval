<a href="#0" id="0">A more recent result by Jansen and Kratsch [20] showed that ILP is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the treewidth of the primal graph and the maximum absolute domain value of any variable.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}T′ be the subtree of T obtained after the exhaustive application of Corollary 10 to T.We will first show that if x is a variable at depth i of {a mathematical formula}T′, then x has at most {a mathematical formula}di children and {a mathematical formula}|Tx′|≤ei.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In parameterized algorithmics [4], [11], [25], [7] the runtime of an algorithm is studied with respect to a parameter {a mathematical formula}k∈N and input size n. The basic idea is to find a parameter that describes the structure of the instance such that the combinatorial explosion can be confined to this parameter.</a>
