<a href="#0" id="0">Now we show that {a mathematical formula}lfp(O) is indeed strictly grounded.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the context of ADFs, one is often also interested in other forms of reasoning such as credulous or sceptical reasoning [39].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Approximation fixpoint theory and logic programming.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">He called expansions weakly grounded and proposed alternative definitions for so called moderately grounded and strongly grounded expansions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">An AF is a directed graph where the nodes are arguments and the edges encode a notion of attack between arguments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Groundedness of the AFT family of semantics for AEL</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The most precise approximator is the ultimate approximator {a mathematical formula}UP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As such, the intuition regarding the grounded extension is similar to intuitions regarding grounded fixpoints: we only accept arguments with a good, non-self-supporting defence.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Follows immediately from the definitions.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In what follows, we study some properties of (strictly) grounded (fix)points.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The efforts to avoid these led to the development of perfect, stable and well-founded semantics.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The intuitions underlying grounded fixpoints of ADFs are of course similar to those in other domains where AFT is applied.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We often identify an interpretation I with the four-valued interpretation {a mathematical formula}(I,I).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">However, we observe that this example is quite extraordinary, and this is the case for all such programs that we found.</a>
