<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, the portfolios fdss-1 and fdss-2 also managed to keep within the available memory and show good usage.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is a counterintuitive result, since these planners are portfolios that consist of a collection of solvers that are invoked in succession.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, the difference between arvandherd and all the other entrants, as evidenced by the statistical test performed in Section 4.4.1 for which results are summarized in Fig. 16 (page 103), is deemed statistically significant.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The results clearly indicate that research in this field is not yet mature and more research is needed to exploit additional computational resources.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, in other cases, such as the CSP competition, the organizers only select problems that can be solved by at least one of the participants in a sensible time frame, and a somewhat related approach was followed in IPC-2011 (Section 3.2 and Appendix D).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence, the final score for each planner equals the number of problems it solved.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">phsff solved 120 problems in the first 13 s (and yahsp2-mt solved 109), whereas arvandherd solved 119 problems.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Distinguished performers in the temporal satisficing track</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Furthermore, the evaluation has to measure the domain independence of planners, quantifying their versatility for different classes of problems across different domains.</a>
