<a href="#0" id="0">To sum up, BiGE generally outperforms the five state-of-the-art algorithms, with the best and second best HV results in 19 and 12 out of all the 34 test instances, respectively.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The solutions obtained by FD-NSGA-II converge into one point of the Pareto front, while the solutions of MOEA/D concentrate in the boundaries of the optimal front.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Three well-known continuous and combinatorial benchmark suites, the walking fish group (WFG) toolkit [40], the multi-objective 0â€“1 knapsack problem [100], and the multi-objective traveling salesman problem (TSP) [18], are included, with the objective number {a mathematical formula}m=5, 10, and 15.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Inspired by biological evolution mechanisms, EAs have been demonstrated to be successful in diverse AI applications [73], [10].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Intuitively, there are three ways of implementing the incorporation of the decision-maker preferences into the proposed bi-goal evolution framework: 1) incorporating the preference information into the proximity goal, 2) incorporating the preference information into the diversity goal, and 3) incorporating the preference information into both the proximity and diversity goals.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Specifically, BiGE obtains the best and second best HV results on 14 and 10 out of the 27 instances respectively, and HypE on 10 and 15 respectively.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that the variation operations (e.g., crossover and mutation) are not fixed in BiGE and can be freely chosen by users.</a>
