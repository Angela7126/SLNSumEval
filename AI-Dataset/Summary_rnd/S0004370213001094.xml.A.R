<a href="#0" id="0">From the query Q construction (and the fact that {a mathematical formula}ΠMix consists of all rules in {a mathematical formula}ΠR whose bodies contain mixed, defined, or constraint literals) it immediately follows that Q is based on Π. Let γ be the union of Ξ for each rule r in {a mathematical formula}ΠMix such that Ξ is the substitution so that {a mathematical formula}rΞ=r(ground(Π),M).</a>

<a href="#2" id="2">The broad attention to CASP suggests a need for a principled and general study of methods to develop unifying terminology and formalisms suitable to capture variants of the languages and solvers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">the only transition rule justifying this edge is Unfounded, and some edge {a mathematical formula}M⟹M″ can be justified by a transition rule other than Unfounded or Decide.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">On the other hand, if we replace the sixth rule of (4) by semantically the same rule (8) the program is not super-safe (but safe) as both conditions 1 and 2 are violated.</a>
