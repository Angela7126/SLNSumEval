<a href="#0" id="0">In the second network, each of the 198 nodes corresponds to a jazz musician, and two artists are linked if they have played in the same band.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That is, we consider all subsets of {a mathematical formula}V(G) and define a function that assigns to every such subset a numerical value; we set this value to be the subset's group betweenness centrality.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that this centrality measure has all the properties of the Shapley value, including Symmetry, Efficiency and Marginality (see Section 3); although not all of them (especially Efficiency) seem as appealing in the network context as they are in the game-theoretic context.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Every path stored in the array {a mathematical formula}Tsv can be extended by every path stored in the array {a mathematical formula}Tvt.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The origins of this approach can be traced back to the concept of group centrality, whereby centrality is computed not just for individual nodes, but also for groups of nodes [29].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Largest Component (LC), which focuses on the size of the largest connected group of nodes in the network [1].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The final experiment of this section is on the random scale-free networks of Barabasi and Albert [10] and the binomial networks of Erdos and Renyi [27].</a>
