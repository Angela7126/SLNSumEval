<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}X∈A is acceptable with respect to S iff {a mathematical formula}∀Y∈A such that {a mathematical formula}(Y,X)∈C : {a mathematical formula}∃Z∈S such that {a mathematical formula}(Z,Y)∈C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The two attack relations shown to be well behaved are those in which the attacking argument's conclusion is classically equivalent to, respectively classically entails, the negation of a premise in the attacked argument.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In dialogical applications, the only distinction between X and {a mathematical formula}X′=({a},{a→b},¬(a→¬b)) is that in {a mathematical formula}X′{a mathematical formula}a→b is a premise that an interlocutor commits to.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We now show monotonicity of a dialectical AF's characteristic function, restricted to the domain of epistemically maximal admissible sets.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, if the {a mathematical formula}pdAF's preference relation is redundance-coherent, then {a mathematical formula}C≺A implies {a mathematical formula}C′≺A.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence {a mathematical formula}∀α∈Δ, {a mathematical formula}∃B∈E s.t.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(1)Since {a mathematical formula}B1 is contaminating, then there is a {a mathematical formula}pdAF1=(A1,D1) such that:{a mathematical formula}Cncp(pdAF1)=Cncp(pdAF1⊕pdAF3)=Cncp(pdAF1⊕pdAF4)Hence {a mathematical formula}Cncp(pdAF1⊕pdAF3)|Sy=Cncp(pdAF1⊕pdAF4)|Sy.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A ‘preferred subtheory’ (ps) is obtained by taking a maximal (under set inclusion) consistent subset of {a mathematical formula}B1, maximally extended with a subset of {a mathematical formula}B2, and so on.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence, given an argument represented as {a mathematical formula}({p,¬p,r,r→q},∅,q) it may be that q is derived from {a mathematical formula}r,r→q, or explosively from {a mathematical formula}p,¬p; there is no way of telling which is the case without reference to the proof theory.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}Y∈E,Z∈E, {a mathematical formula}Y≠X,Z≠X, and {a mathematical formula}Y⇒E∪{X}Z. Hence {a mathematical formula}Y⇒EZ, contradicting E is complete and so conflict free.2.</a>
