<a href="#0" id="0">It follows that POMDPs with almost-sure winning for {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 objectives under finite-memory strategies is EXPTIME-hard.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The following lemma intuitively shows that the collapsedstrategy can reach all the states the original strategy could reach.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our counter-example shows that standard techniques based on subset construction (to construct an exponential size perfect-observation MDP) are not adequate to solve the problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also show that the almost-sure winning problem with quantitative constraints is undecidable even for finite-memory strategies.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We start with a few notations below:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This heuristic dramatically reduces the size of {a mathematical formula}G¯←Red(G) of Algorithm 1 in our example case studies.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The formal construction is as follows:</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let us denote by {a mathematical formula}Proj1(B(ρ¯))⊆S the projection on the first component of the states in the belief support.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Moreover, the state {a mathematical formula}(Xi,m) is recurrent (since {a mathematical formula}Ri(Xi)=1) and almost-sure winning state (since {a mathematical formula}Wi(Xi)=1) in the Markov chain {a mathematical formula}G↾σ.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We refer to the problem where the controller must satisfy a path constraint with a probability threshold {a mathematical formula}λ2∈(0,1] as the probabilistic semantics.</a>
