<a href="#0" id="0">It follows that the problem is in NP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An implicate C is called absorbed by φ if it has no empowered literal.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If φ is a prime quadratic CNF formula, then it is propagation complete.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is a well-known fact that if {a mathematical formula}φ⊢1x (where x is an arbitrary literal), then unit propagation on φ satisfies x or derives contradiction.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus a tied chain in {a mathematical formula}φW has to look as follows: {a mathematical formula}Di1,…,Diq, where {a mathematical formula}f(ij)=j, i.e. {a mathematical formula}Di1 contains {a mathematical formula}(a1∨a2¯), {a mathematical formula}Diq contains {a mathematical formula}(aq∨a1) or vice versa if we look at the tied chain in the opposite direction.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We prove that for a non-PC CNF formula with s occurrences of literals there always exists a resolution proof of length {a mathematical formula}O(s) of some empowering implicate.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Conclusions</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By using the previous proposition we show that we may add the clause C to the obtained clause {a mathematical formula}Cψ to obtain a clause which is both 1-provable and empowering.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, any formula can be extended to a propagation complete one by repeatedly adding empowering implicates.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It follows from Theorem 4.2 that φ has an empowering implicate if and only if it has an empowering and 1-provable implicate.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We say that a propagator detects dis-entailment if {a mathematical formula}f(D(X))=∅ whenever C has no solution.</a>
