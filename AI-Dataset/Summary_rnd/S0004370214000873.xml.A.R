<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, since for every subset {a mathematical formula}L of {a mathematical formula}C-QDAG, {a mathematical formula}L⊆L[∨]⊆L[∨,∃], ⊆ is included into {a mathematical formula}≥p, and both ⊆ and {a mathematical formula}≥p are transitive relations, a number of additional inclusions/polynomial translatability results can be directly obtained from the results above; they will be exploited in some forthcoming proofs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proof is broken into six steps, where we prove some succinctness relationships between languages, and then apply transitivity of {a mathematical formula}≤s to possibly infer new relationships.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">PI satisfies all the queries but CT, and the transformations CD, FO, SFO, ∨BC.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}¬p∨q and {a mathematical formula}¬q∨r are essential prime implicates of α, while {a mathematical formula}¬p∨r is not.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}V(α)) can be computed in polynomial time from γ (resp.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By transitivity of {a mathematical formula}≤s, we get the results given in Table 11.Table 12: Consider the following consistent KROM formula {a mathematical formula}αn=⋀i=1n(¬xi∨¬yi); it is also a HORN formula, hence it belongs to the disjunction closure and to the full disjunctive closure of each language among KROM, HORN, {a mathematical formula}K/H, and renH.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">One can observe that the resulting succinctness picture is similar to the expressiveness picture for the corresponding incomplete fragments AFF, renH, {a mathematical formula}K/H, HORN, KROM.</a>
