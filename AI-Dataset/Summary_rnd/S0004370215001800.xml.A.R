<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}O∪mX is {a mathematical formula}O′, where {a mathematical formula}O′ contains just the argument graphs in O and X, and {a mathematical formula}u(O′)=u(O)∖X.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To avoid redundancies in arguments, of the form illustrated in Example 2, several existing approaches to structured argumentation, e.g., logic-based argumentation [5] and DeLP [20], impose forms of minimality on the support of arguments.</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, if any component in the {a mathematical formula}(k+1)-th tuple is the same as in the k-th, the result trivially holds again by the induction hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then by Lemma A.13, Lemma A.14, since {a mathematical formula}Gr is acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We conducted an analysis of the argumentation frameworks for these applications,{sup:5} which showed that none of them contained rules which allow the construction of cyclical arguments like {a mathematical formula}a2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We must show that (I) if {a mathematical formula}a∈(fj+1(∅)∖fj(∅)) then {a mathematical formula}a is represented in {a mathematical formula}fRj+1(◊); and that (II) if {a mathematical formula}a is represented in {a mathematical formula}fRj+1(◊) but not in {a mathematical formula}fRj(◊), then {a mathematical formula}a∈fj+1(∅).</a>
