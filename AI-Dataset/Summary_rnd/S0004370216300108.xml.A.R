<a href="#0" id="0">In particular, the set {a mathematical formula}{a∧¬a} is a minimal proof for both a and ¬a.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A set {a mathematical formula}M⊆K is called minimal inconsistent subset (MI) of {a mathematical formula}K if {a mathematical formula}M⊨⊥ and there is no {a mathematical formula}M′⊂M with {a mathematical formula}M′⊨⊥.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It follows that {a mathematical formula}Cv(Imc,n)=∞.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}Cf(Imv,n)=∞If {a mathematical formula}|K|=1 then observe that either {a mathematical formula}Imv(K)=0 or {a mathematical formula}Imv(K)=1 (if the knowledge base is inconsistent then all propositions appearing in {a mathematical formula}K also appear in the only formula of {a mathematical formula}K and are thus part of a minimal inconsistent subset), so we have {a mathematical formula}Cf(Imv,1)=2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We leave a deeper investigation of this matter for future work.</a>
