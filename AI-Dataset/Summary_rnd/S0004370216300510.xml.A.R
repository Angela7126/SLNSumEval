<a href="#1" id="1">A second movement not displayed, (1L), performed the opposite movement undoing (1R).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In Fig. 6{a mathematical formula}do(A,S) denotes the resulting situation after performing action A on situation S.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To the best of our knowledge, the current AI literature presents no other work aiming at the representation and reasoning about domains containing flexible objects and holes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When a closed string R forming a single loop {a mathematical formula}chain(R)=[Rb−,Rb+] is persistent, i.e., it cannot be made open by any domain action, it is named as ring and its related loop {a mathematical formula}l(R,Rb−,[0,1]) is abbreviated as the string name R by a slight abuse of notation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The inclusion of loops inside larger loops is well illustrated by state {a mathematical formula}S2 in Fig. 6.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A system state will describe two kinds of basic relations among strings and other objects: links and crossings.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our initial efforts were put in solving the so-called Fisherman's Folly puzzle shown in Fig. 1 using a list-based representation of string crossings.</a>
