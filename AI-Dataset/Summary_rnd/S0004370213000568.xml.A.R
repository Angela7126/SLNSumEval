<a href="#0" id="0">Minimal change: Relevance and recovery revisited.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given that recovery is the only AGM postulate that encodes minimality, Hansson proposed to replace recovery by a new postulate called relevance, which states that any proposition that is removed from our beliefs during a contraction must somehow contribute to inferring the contracted belief [11]; in other words, all removed propositions were removed for good reasons.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this respect, it is worth mentioning that it has been argued that partial-meet construction (and consequently relevance-contraction) in Horn logic have undesirable properties [32], [15], [16].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence, relevance is trivially satisfied.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, obviously, {a mathematical formula}C⊂D and {a mathematical formula}D⊆Cn(K), so, given that {a mathematical formula}C∈K⊥A, it follows that {a mathematical formula}A⊆D.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">□ AGM-compliant logics that satisfy the descending chain condition satisfy complementarity.Suppose that the logic is {a mathematical formula}〈L,Cn〉, and take any {a mathematical formula}A⊆L such that {a mathematical formula}Cn(∅)⊂Cn(A)⊂Cn(L).</a>
