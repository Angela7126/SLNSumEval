<a href="#0" id="0">At the semantic level, the four considered types of meta-literals correspond to lower bounds on the four main uncertainty measures from possibility theory, i.e., the necessity, possibility, guaranteed possibility and potential necessity measures.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the other hand, if this is not the case, then {a mathematical formula}Φ′ has an e-model which is not a refinement of π (since any refinement of {a mathematical formula}π1 is also an e-model of {a mathematical formula}Nλ1(α1)∧...∧Nλn(αn)).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The less specific than relation ≼ defines a partial order on the set of e-models of a GPL knowledge base K in a natural way, which allows us to introduce two non-monotonic entailment relations:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Intuitively, Bψ is true if ψ is known to be true, i.e., we can think of {a mathematical formula}Sb as the set of worlds that the agent considers possible.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Preliminaries from possibility theory</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is a consequence of the fact that the modalities in MBNF have a clear epistemic flavor, which does not seem to be the case for the connectives in equilibrium logic.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then we also have {a mathematical formula}l∈M which means {a mathematical formula}π⊨N1(l) and in particular {a mathematical formula}π(ω)=0.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consider again the formula {a mathematical formula}N1(u)∨N1(v) and its minimally specific e-models {a mathematical formula}πu and {a mathematical formula}πv from Example 3.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">When k is clear from the context we will also refer to this logic as GPL, and to the corresponding language as {a mathematical formula}LGPL.</a>
