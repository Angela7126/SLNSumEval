<a href="#0" id="0">Nonrequisite arcs indicate that variable X is irrelevant to selecting an optimal policy for A, and its removal leaves the expected utility of the optimal strategy unchanged.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An arc from a node X into a state node S indicates that S is (potentially) stochastically dependent on X. State variables satisfy the Markov condition, which states that any (state) variable is independent of its non-descendant non-parents conditional on its parents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider the second-order Taylor expansion of {a mathematical formula}e−x around zero given by {a mathematical formula}T2(x)=def1−x+x2/2, whose residual satisfies{a mathematical formula} for some number ξ between 0 and x. Hence, {a mathematical formula}−e−x<x3/6−T2(x), from which it follows that{a mathematical formula} which equals {a mathematical formula}r/z3−1/(2z2)+1/(6z3)=(2r−z+1/3)/(2z3)<0.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 1 summarizes the fixed-parameter computational complexity of the decision version of finding optimal strategies in limids of bounded treewidth with respect to topology, number of value nodes and maximum variable cardinality.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The state variables are binary and take values in {a mathematical formula}{0,1}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This immediate and important result, which we discuss in Section 3, has apparently not been noticed before in the literature.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, {a mathematical formula}∑iE[Vi|δ]=−∑i=1nziδi/z, which equals minus one if and only if the strategy δ is a yes-solution to the partition problem.</a>
