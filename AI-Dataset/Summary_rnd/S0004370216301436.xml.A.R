<a href="#0" id="0">Intuitively, good descriptive features should induce a topology on the space of problem instances such that similar problem instances should be recommended the same algorithm.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Under the assumption that the Matrix Completion results are good, the latent factors can be viewed as “oracle features” in the sense that they encapsulate all information required for AS.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Pre-schedulers could then be derived by allocating to the top-ranked algorithms a given part of the computational budget; as these top-ranked algorithms depend on the current instance, one would thus get a per-instance pre-scheduler.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">j-th algorithm) is mapped onto the k-dimensional vector {a mathematical formula}Ui (resp.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Matrix completion {a mathematical formula}cf(p) and cold start {a mathematical formula}cs(p) performances are graphically depicted using a boxplot.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Firstly, AS is a small or medium-size problem, usually involving a few thousand problems and a few hundred algorithms (or less), thus smaller by two orders of magnitude than CF.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let us build K clusters in the initial space (using standard K-means clustering [16], where the appropriate value of K is determined using the Silhouette score [41]); let us associate a color to each initial cluster.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The second category includes the PREMARSHALLING-ASTAR-2015 (Fig. 8) and the MAXSAT-12-PMS datasets (Fig. 9), with a low average rank of the single best baseline (respectively 2.07 and 2.5).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This question is empirically investigated by defining an artificial AS problem, involving 200 problem instances and 30 algorithms.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">CF exploits the (n, m) matrix {a mathematical formula}M which stores the feedback of the user community.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The second indicator, Regret, is the test error of the selected algorithm minus the test error of the true best algorithm.</a>
