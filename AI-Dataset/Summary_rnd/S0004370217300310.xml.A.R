<a href="#0" id="0">With few exceptions, AI and Robotics are today regarded as separate fields, that belong to different academic partitions (computer science for AI, mechanical or electronic engineering for robotics), and have their own respective communities and scientific traditions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Today, we are witnessing an increasing commercial interest in products that require a combination of robotics and AI technologies, like autonomous cars and industrial vehicles.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This would need AI and Robotics to aid researchers in the pure (and social) sciences to obtain a finer level understanding of earthbound environmental processes, e.g., harmful algal blooms in the oceans, air pollution in cities and towns, the carbon life-cycle, etc.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">[18] shows how learning can be done when the context changes between executions, thus addressing RC1.</a>
