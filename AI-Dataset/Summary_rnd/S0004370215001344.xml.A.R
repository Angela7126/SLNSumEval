<a href="#0" id="0">Markov networks are often represented as log-linear models, where each clique potential is replaced by an exponentiated weighted sum of features of the state:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Other SRL approaches have focused on high level cognitive decision processes with no native integration with learning in the presence of continuous high dimensional data representations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One separate binary classifier for each class has been built for SVM, LSVM, TSVM.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The dom heuristic applied to SBR has connections with research in deep learning that has shifted the attention on teaching plans in a more systematic way [4], but also at a more generic level with studies in the field of developmental psychology, since it is well-known that many animals experiment stage-based learning [37].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We assume that a set of H functional constraints in the form {a mathematical formula}1−Φh(f)=0,0≤Φh(f)≤1,h=1,…,H are provided in order to describe how the query functions should behave.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">More specifically, SBR builds a multi-layer architecture having kernel machines at the input layer.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">When multiple universally or existentially quantified variables are present, the conversion is performed recursively from the outer to the inner variables.</a>
