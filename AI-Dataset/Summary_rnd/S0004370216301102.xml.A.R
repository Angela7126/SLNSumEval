<a href="#1" id="1">assume {a mathematical formula}Y⊆S and {a mathematical formula}a,x5∈S, we have that all of {a mathematical formula}FC and Y are in range, {a mathematical formula}x¯ is attacked and {a mathematical formula}FX needs to be evaluated on its own.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">◊</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example we have seen in Theorem 2 that {a mathematical formula}CAFprf⊂CAFnai, that is, every af that is compact for preferred semantics is also compact for naive semantics and there exist afs compact for naive but not compact for preferred semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For an af{a mathematical formula}F=(B,S) we use {a mathematical formula}AF and {a mathematical formula}RF to refer to B and S, respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For any rational SCC-splittable argumentation semantics σ deciding whether anafis analytic for σ is as hard as deciding whether anafis compact for σ. The result even holds if one knows that theafbeing tested for being analytic is already compact.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The following proposition shows that one additional argument allows, together with an appropriate modification of the attack relation, to make any single implicit conflict explicit.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First, one may easily verify that for any afF we have, {a mathematical formula}|prf(F)|≤|prf(irr(F))| as well as {a mathematical formula}prf(F)⊆prf(sym(F)).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider the extension-set {a mathematical formula}S′={{a,b,c},{a,b′,c′}, {a mathematical formula}{a′,b,c′}, {a mathematical formula}{a′,b′,c}}.</a>

<a href="#10" id="10">Furthermore, G consists of 9 arguments.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">One of our main results was the refutation of the Explicit Conflict Conjecture, originally proposed in [10] for stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Moreover, it was shown in [22] that there is no compact af (in this case an af not using argument x) that yields the same stable extensions as {a mathematical formula}F1.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">□</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The analytic signature (x-signature){a mathematical formula}Σσx of semantics σ consists of all extension-sets that are analytically realizable under σ:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The ultimate goal remains to design pre-processing procedures that identify rejected arguments that can be removed and implicit conflicts that can be made explicit; in other words, simplifications of the given af into a semantically equivalent af with better computational properties.</a>
