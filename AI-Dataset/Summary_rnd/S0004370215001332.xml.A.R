<a href="#0" id="0">The pddl3 language [18] supports the specification of trajectory constraints such as {a mathematical formula}(alwaysP), {a mathematical formula}(sometimesP), {a mathematical formula}(hold-aftertP) etc.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This incurs a substantial computational burden and requires extensions to existing metric temporal planning languages and methods.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Condition-checker modules confirm, by invoking the external solver, that a planned action can be successfully applied in the current state.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This network models some of the assumptions of future distribution networks, characterised by the presence of distributed generators.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While this narrowing of the TRPG at each TIF layer might provide additional heuristic information for some problems, by leading to longer relaxed plans, it does not help for BTMPs in which there are no mixed metric constraints in the preconditions of actions, since in this case the reachable actions are not influenced by the uncontrollable variables and the relaxed plan therefore cannot be affected either.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Instead, different linear approximations can be applied in situations in which it is possible to consider only the active power.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The tap is prevented from being stepped down until 17.902, but is not actually stepped-down until 19.901.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this section we present a formalism for achieving the interface between the planner and the external solver.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">An active meshed network can contain cycles and there might be multiple sources of generation distributed around the network.</a>
