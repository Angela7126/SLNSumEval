<a href="#0" id="0">We are able to define an interpretation problem as follows.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This reject option is added as another possible answer expressing doubt.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This reasoning mode avoids the generation of a new hypothesis for every piece of available evidence if it can be explained by a previous hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This proposal has been applied to diagnose pediatric growth trends.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, given two observables q and {a mathematical formula}q′, {a mathematical formula}qexcludesq′ entails that they cannot be observed over two overlapping intervals, i.e., every two observations {a mathematical formula}o=〈q,v,tb,te〉 and {a mathematical formula}o′=〈q′,v′,t′b,t′e〉 satisfy either {a mathematical formula}te<t′b or {a mathematical formula}t′e<tb.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let us consider the interpretation problem set out in Example 5.1 and the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I1 shown in Fig. 6.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The proposed framework formulates an interpretation problem as an abduction problem with constraints, targeted at finding a set of hypotheses covering all the observations while satisfying a set of constraints on their attribute and temporal values.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The exclusion relation is symmetric and transitive.</a>
