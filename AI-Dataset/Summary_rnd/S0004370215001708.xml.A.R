<a href="#0" id="0">This is often impossible, in fact even for very simple queries [2].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, relational algebra often relies on some derived operations for implementing commonly occurring queries.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">But that is problematic for two reasons.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In real life queries are written in a specific query language, but their semantics is of course such.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The answer, as we shall argue, is negative: the standard intersection semantics leads to many problems, and crucially to producing meaningless query answers.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since {a mathematical formula}〚x〛≈j is not empty, pick an object c from this set.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Certain answers can be viewed as either objects or theories, depending on the semantics, and the logical formalism used.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We can view it as a query from {a mathematical formula}Dowa(σ2) to {a mathematical formula}Dowa(σ2); recall that {a mathematical formula}σ2 is the vocabulary of a single binary relation.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Second, even if they exist, they are not unique.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For the converse, let φ be in {a mathematical formula}Th(Q(〚x〛)); take {a mathematical formula}φQ that exists by the substitution property.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Yet another situation where genericity is lost is when nulls and constants behave differently in queries.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If we have two such objects y and {a mathematical formula}y′, and {a mathematical formula}y′⪯y, then of course we prefer y as giving us more information.Thus, the object that we seek must be less informative than all objects in X, and at the same time the most informative among such objects.</a>
