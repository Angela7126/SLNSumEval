<a href="#0" id="0">The main idea of the proof is to define a specific class of games (see Example 2 in [59]), in which the exploration in a greater depth of the game tree causes a bias in the values observed in the higher levels of the tree, consequently leading to an incorrect decision in the root.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Finally, we describe algorithms based directly on Counterfactual Regret (CFR, a notion of regret at the information set level), first designed for extensive-form games with imperfect information [28].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Next we compare the exact algorithms in the variant of Goofspiel with standard chance nodes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We first describe the algorithms in the offline setting, followed by the necessary modifications used in the online case described in Section 5.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This problem is not apparent in the smaller games, because the higher probability of sampling individual terminal histories causes smaller variance and OOS performs enough samples to make the regret estimates sufficiently close to the true values.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this paper, we provide an extensive analysis of algorithms for solving and playing zero-sum extensive-form games with perfect information and simultaneous moves.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As described in Section 5, each algorithm keeps results of previous computations and does not start from scratch in the next state.</a>
