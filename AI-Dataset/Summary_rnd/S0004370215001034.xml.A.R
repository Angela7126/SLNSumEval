<a href="#0" id="0">Geometrically, we say that the point {a mathematical formula}pb is between points {a mathematical formula}pa and {a mathematical formula}pc if {a mathematical formula}cos⁡(papb→,pbpc→)=1, where we write {a mathematical formula}cos⁡(x,y) for vectors x and y to denote the cosine of the angle between x and y. Both notions of betweenness can be linked to each other, by considering that natural properties tend to correspond to convex regions in conceptual spaces [9].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The directions in Table 9 mainly correspond to different flavours found in wine, which is unsurprising since reviews from which the conceptual space {a mathematical formula}Swine was induced are essentially tasting notes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For rules predicting non-membership, this score is multiplied by −1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One of the possible applications of the betweenness classifier is to merge different taxonomies.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that while analogical reasoning is a broad area of study, we will not be concerned with approaches that aim to transfer knowledge from one domain to another [33].</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">In a convex hull based classifier, every category {a mathematical formula}Ci is represented geometrically as the convex hull of the points (i.e. entities) that are known to belong to {a mathematical formula}Ci.</a>
