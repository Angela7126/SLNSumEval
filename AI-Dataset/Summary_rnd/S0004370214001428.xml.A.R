<a href="#0" id="0">Consequently, there is an edge uv in {a mathematical formula}HP such that {a mathematical formula}{u,v}∩X=∅, contradicting the assumption that X is a vertex cover.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The purpose of this paper is to develop a backdoor approach for answer set programming.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The set{a mathematical formula}X={b}is a deletionNormal-backdoor of{a mathematical formula}P11n.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then {a mathematical formula}{b,c} is a vertex cover of {a mathematical formula}NP.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider the programs{a mathematical formula}P6nand{a mathematical formula}P7n.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Its incidence graph contains a clique on n vertices.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The sequence {a mathematical formula}(d,e,f) is an even cycle and a directed even cycle, {a mathematical formula}(c,e) is a directed bad even cycle.The set {a mathematical formula}X={c} is a strong {a mathematical formula}no-DBEC-backdoor since the truth assignment reducts {a mathematical formula}Pc=0=P0={d←a,e;a←d,¬b;e←f;f} and {a mathematical formula}P1={d←a,e;f←d;b;f} are in the target class no-DBEC.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consider program{a mathematical formula}P4nand let{a mathematical formula}P=P4n.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence {a mathematical formula}(P1,k), {a mathematical formula}(P1,2k) respectively, is an instance of Consistency, parameterized by the size of a smallest strong {a mathematical formula}C-backdoor or deletion {a mathematical formula}C-backdoor, and if this problem would admit a polynomial kernel, this would imply that Sat[Vars] is compressible.For the problem Brave Reasoning we modify the reduction from above.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this paper we develop a rigorous theory of backdoors for answer set programming.</a>
