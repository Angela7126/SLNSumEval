<a href="#0" id="0">From among undominated SBPs, we may select in an arbitrary, pre-defined way.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have investigated conditions under which vendors may benefit from posting group or volume discounts for groups of buyers—assuming that buyers can coordinate their purchasing activities—relative to the posting of fixed prices.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus according to Myerson, this auction is truthful.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given their uncertainty about the buyer's types, and without a distribution over these types, we assume vendors assess the utility of a strategy by assuming a type profile realization that maximizes the degree to which that strategy is suboptimal.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our main contribution in this work is an analysis of the impact of buyer coordination (in the LB model) on vendor pricing, in particular, in the presence of competing vendors.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Denote by {a mathematical formula}q2,…,qm the (fixed) prices of all other vendors.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Vendor behavior</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In each case the optimal utility is no more than 12, and thus {a mathematical formula}Reg(4,v)≤12−8=4.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It is therefore important to identify natural classes of distributions where optimal or near-optimal schedules can be computed efficiently.</a>
