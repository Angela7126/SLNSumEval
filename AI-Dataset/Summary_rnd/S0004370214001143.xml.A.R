<a href="#1" id="1">Accuracy: We compute the learner's prediction accuracy throughout the course of teaching, using the complete set of examples as the test set.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The rest of the participants had some problem following the strategy.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Participants were often successful at providing the positive examples but failed at providing the negative ones that varied by one feature at a time.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For these problems we propose using teaching heuristics that approximate the informativeness of an example for the learner.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We note that the intuition behind a teaching heuristic remains the same in both settings.</a>
