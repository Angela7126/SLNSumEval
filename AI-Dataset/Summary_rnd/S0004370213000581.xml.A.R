<a href="#0" id="0">The idea of the method is to build a training set using the inheritance rule explained before.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we will see, the majority of the paradigms which are isolated in Fig. 7 are indeed part of the Vocabulary-based family, which is characterized for the first time in our review and extensively analyzed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Instead of using a clustering algorithm with hard-assignment, as in the last section, we can use a clustering algorithm with soft-assignment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also evaluated whether the IS methods based on the SMI assumption are successful in a situation where this assumption holds.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We see now representative algorithms of the distance-based sub-paradigm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this section we evaluate the performance of the methods in a situation where bag-level information is necessary.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It does not seem that the SMI assumption makes any clear difference, for example in databases such as Musk2 where it is considered by many authors that the SMI assumption applies well.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For this purpose, the H-BoW histogram must be binarized, as it is only important to know the presence or absence of instances in each cluster.</a>
