<a href="#1" id="1">(ii) For an input attribute position of an external atom, this is the case if it is finite, i.e., if it is a constant input parameter which is bounded, or if it is a predicate input parameter with a predicate whose attribute positions are all already known to be lde-safe.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let A be a model of {a mathematical formula}grndC(Π).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, we could in applications of DL-programs sometimes even experience a sensible run time improvement by removing domain predicates.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Case (2), b is either (2a) a non-replacement literal, or (2b) a (positive or default-negated) external atom replacement.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Route planning For each instance size n we generated 50 instances by randomly drawing n locations to visit plus n possible locations for having lunch (the data does not provide information about such locations, but usually there are restaurants or snack bars in the near area of stations).</a>
