<a href="#0" id="0">Then{a mathematical formula}R(π)≥ρiff{a mathematical formula}π′achieves all goals with at least ρ probability in{a mathematical formula}P′.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that in this comparison, we consider only instances for which both planners return valid plans.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This journal article is a unification of two prior conference publications, [21] and [20], with several significant extensions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this section we will show that the problem of generating plans with at least ρ robustness value can be compiled into a conformant probabilistic planning problem [8].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The plans produced by each of the systems for the test problems are evaluated in terms of the estimate of their posterior robustness.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We now discuss our choice for the underlying search algorithm.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since {a mathematical formula}s⊥⊈F, {a mathematical formula}PreD(a)⊈s⊥, ({a mathematical formula}∀a∈A,D∈《D˜》), and {a mathematical formula}s⊥⊭G.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This proves the theorem.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We start with eight cases that were randomly generated, and then we make use of various subsets of this case library.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For each{a mathematical formula}σ∈M(Σπ),{a mathematical formula}γGEDσ(π,I)⊨G.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In extending PISA to take plan traces {a mathematical formula}T into account, we create the set of constraints {a mathematical formula}ΣT up front and then use them at every step of the search.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This ensures that all constraints in {a mathematical formula}Σπ˜ come from actions in {a mathematical formula}π˜, not from the clause set propagated in {a mathematical formula}G. In case the new relaxed plan is not robust enough, we push known and possible preconditions of the newly inserted action into the subgoal queue Q, ignoring those known to be T (Line 33–35), and repeat the process.</a>
