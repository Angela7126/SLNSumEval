<a href="#0" id="0">Instead of trying to match a full CAD model to the point cloud, a pre-assignment filter similar to [49] could take only those CAD model points into account, which are expected to have a corresponding point in the sensor data and vice versa.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In these cases, their areas can be summed up.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The results clearly indicate that as long as the CAD model is “similar enough” (chairs 1–4) to the objects found in the data, our system works.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If such a condition is detected, the initial k value will be increased dynamically until the bounding box criterion is fulfilled.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After that, evaluation results are presented and discussed.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A photograph of the chair and a view of the resulting point cloud can be seen in Fig. 5.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This usually leads to one false positive (for the non-existent object at the center location) and several false negatives for actual objects creating the aggregated plane.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From this characterization, our approach is similar to the work of Klank et al. [24], Mozos et al. [25], Usenko et al. [26] and Wohlkinger et al. [27].</a>
