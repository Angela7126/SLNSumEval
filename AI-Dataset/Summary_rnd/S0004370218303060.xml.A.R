<a href="#0" id="0">The other direction is also very similar to the previous case.Next, we further modify the reduction to make the policy a fact.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Take the source instance representing {a mathematical formula}G1 as {a mathematical formula}D. Then, {a mathematical formula}Good() will hold on its image, and every {a mathematical formula}D′ indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}D must have a homomorphism from {a mathematical formula}q1 (i.e., {a mathematical formula}G1), and hence from {a mathematical formula}G2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Unfortunately, we show in Section 7.1 that the data-independent compliance problem is undecidable under rather strong restrictions on the input.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In our example, the data integration setting {a mathematical formula}(Oex,Mex,D1ex) does not comply to policy {a mathematical formula}pex since {a mathematical formula}pex(P1) and {a mathematical formula}pex(P2) hold over all source instances indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}Dex1 for {a mathematical formula}Oex and {a mathematical formula}Mex (and in particular they hold over {a mathematical formula}D2ex).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Besides this, the source schema has binary relational names {a mathematical formula}PartSum, {a mathematical formula}PreVal and {a mathematical formula}CurrVal, as well as unary relational names {a mathematical formula}Summ, for {a mathematical formula}m=1,…,n.</a>
