<a href="#0" id="0">The interest for our purpose of this property is that it allows from any model to reach any other one, and then ensuring the exhaustivity property of relaxation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Representation results that make a correspondence between a large family of logics containing non-classical logics such as DL and HCL and AGM postulates for revision with such minimality criteria have then been obtained.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, we propose to generalize to any satisfaction system the approach developed in [22] for propositional logic and in [30] for description logics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}T⊆Sen.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Some of them can meet the requirement of a knowledge engineer, and some other may not completely, depending on the context, the ontology, etc.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The reason is that semantics is not explicit in the abstract framework of logics defined by Tarski.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let us show now the supplementary conditions of Theorem 1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It also suggests the theory behind satisfaction systems to be a principled framework for dealing with knowledge dynamics with the growing interest on non-classical logics such as DL.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A similar construction can be found in [29] for sentences of the form {a mathematical formula}(a:C).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In [22], the authors bypass the problem by representing any knowledge base K (which is a theory in [22]) by a propositional formula ψ such that {a mathematical formula}K=Cn(ψ).</a>
