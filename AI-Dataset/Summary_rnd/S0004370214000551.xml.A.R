<a href="#0" id="0">Bounded-cost search problemGiven an initial state s, a goal test function, and a constant C, a bounded-cost search problem is the problem of finding a path from s to a goal state with cost less than C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A number of efficient admissible (overestimating) heuristics for this problem exist [52] and in our experiments we used the best one, calculated as follows.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}APTS/ANA⁎ dominates all other algorithms throughout the search.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It might be hard to find a domain where the linear-relative assumption holds exactly.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The exact h-model is domain and heuristic dependent.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To avoid having the heuristic overestimate true costs, joint angles are discretized so as to never move the end-effector by more than one cell on the {a mathematical formula}50×50 grid in a single action.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Instead, PTS will expand nodes from OPEN of the previous PTS call.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The term generating a node refers to creating a data structure that represents it, while expanding a node means generating all its children.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Different parameter values can have great impact on the performance of parametric algorithms.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The other research group derived {a mathematical formula}ANA⁎ motivated by a desire to avoid parameter tuning [9].</a>
