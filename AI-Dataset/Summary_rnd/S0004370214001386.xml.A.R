<a href="#0" id="0">We can generate k children, each of which adds a constraint to {a mathematical formula}kâˆ’1 agents (i.e., each child allows only one agent to occupy the conflicting vertex v at time t).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Admissible heuristics for MAPF</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section we study the behavior of MA-CBS empirically on three standard benchmark maps from the game Dragon Age: Origins[47].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The low-level search finds an optimal path for each of the two agents (each of length 3), and expands a total of 8 low-level states for the CT root.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If A* is used, a 2-agent A* will be executed for this.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This cost is referred to as the f-value of node N.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Conclusions from experiments</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Even if an agent arrived at its goal it will block other agents from passing through it.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consequence: at all times at least one CT node in OPENpermits the optimal solution (as a special case of Lemma 2).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We study the behavior of our CBS algorithm and discuss its advantages and drawbacks when compared to A*-based approaches as well as other approaches.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The merging process is done as follows.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As can be seen CT nodes {a mathematical formula}N5 and {a mathematical formula}N6 contain the same set of constraints and are thus duplicates.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If we also want to consider the generated high-level nodes we should multiple this by 2 as each expanded CT node generates 2 new nodes.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">A solution ({a mathematical formula}N.solution).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Hereafter we simply denote {a mathematical formula}blegal by b.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This is because in maps with no bottlenecks and large open spaces, such as den520d, CBS will be inefficient, since many conflicts will occur in many different locations.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">CBS using different cost functions</a>
