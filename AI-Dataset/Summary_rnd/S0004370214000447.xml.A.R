<a href="#0" id="0">The ten methods are used to decompose tasks to subtasks including primitive tasks.htn-depots:The htn-depots domain is also created based on the domain depots from IPC-3, which is composed of: six actions given by IPC-3's depots; eight tasks to move a crate from one place to another, clean crates above some crate, remove a crate as well as crates above the crate, superpose a crate (as well as crates above the crate) on another crate, install a crate into a truck, uninstall a crate from a truck, get a hoist to a target place, and drive a truck to a target domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a result of Step 3, we generate three kinds of constraints {a mathematical formula}SCpa, {a mathematical formula}SCap and {a mathematical formula}SCpm, which are put together to form the state constraints SC.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Gil [21] described a system called EXPO, bootstrapped by an incomplete STRIPS-like domain description with the rest being filled in through experience.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">This indicates that HTNLearn can indeed improve the model quality when creating HTN models.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In addition, we evaluate HTNLearn in more detail, including evaluations with respect to partiality of decomposition trees, and running times with respect to partiality of decomposition trees and human efforts saved by HTNLearn.</a>
