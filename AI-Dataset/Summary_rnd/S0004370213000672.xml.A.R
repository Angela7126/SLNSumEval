<a href="#0" id="0">However, it is worth noting that even for phenomenological rules, our method can often produce plausible conclusions when it is applied locally, e.g. while we should not conclude that there is heavy traffic at mid-day from the observations that there is heavy traffic in the morning and in the evening, it makes sense to conclude that there is heavy-traffic mid-morning if we know that there is heavy traffic in the early morning and late morning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From this result, it also follows that the inference problem considered in this paper is decidable in EXPTIME.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As we can derive this for every i and j, {a mathematical formula}(bet¯4) finally allows us to derive {a mathematical formula}Σ⊢β⋈γ→α.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Most notably, a large number of fuzzy set based approaches have been proposed that build on the idea that the more a situation is compatible with the fuzzy labels in the antecedent of a rule, the more it should be compatible with the fuzzy labels in its consequent.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Again we have that the chosen number of dimensions determines to what extent all quality dimensions, or only the most prominent ones are taken into account.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For that case, we need to verify that for {a mathematical formula}λ∈[0,1] and {a mathematical formula}μ∈[0,+∞[, it holds that{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} provided that the underlying attribute domains {a mathematical formula}D1,…,Dl are all orthogonal.</a>
