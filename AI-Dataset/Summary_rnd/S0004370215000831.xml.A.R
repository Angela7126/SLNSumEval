<a href="#0" id="0">We present to the best of our knowledge the first formulation of hierarchical clustering as an integer linear programming problem with an explicit objective function that is globally optimized.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this sub-section we consider some theoretical results for approximations of the ILP formulation presented in Fig. 5 (i.e. the overlapping hierarchy formulation).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, most algorithmic research and papers focus on non-hierarchical (partitional) clustering.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">H-correlation</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Firstly, we can relax the formal definitions of a legal hierarchy to obtain novel problem settings.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The objective for agglomerative hierarchical clustering is traditionally specified as a greedy process where clusters that are closest together are merged at each level as shown in Fig. 1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Can our method find overlapping clusters in datasets?</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The expectation for {a mathematical formula}Oabc is listed below.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finding the global optima to an intractable problem by definition must be time consuming.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The third set of artificial datasets was different than the previous two.</a>
