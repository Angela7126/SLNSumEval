<a href="#0" id="0">Intuitively, a cavity is weakly continuous if a small marble that can foresee how Hc will evolve and can move arbitrarily quickly can succeed in staying inside Hc.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, one can assert some of the properties of continuous change; for instance, an object with a continuously changing shape cannot go from inside to outside a container without overlapping the container.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An object occupies an interior connected region.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Reachable(t:Time;r:Region).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Inside of Ox4.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In particular, we use the RCC-8 language of topological relations between regions as the basis of our spatial representation; the concept of a closed container can be defined in that language.</a>
