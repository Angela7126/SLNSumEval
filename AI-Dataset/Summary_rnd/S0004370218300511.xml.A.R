<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:1} In this article, we provide a more general and detailed description of our technique, as well as a more thorough experimental evaluation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This connection was further studied for the purpose of using M&S heuristics in symbolic {a mathematical formula}A⁎ search [59].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, abstract state 1 of {a mathematical formula}π1⊗π2 represents states in which package 2 is in the truck and package 1 is at L. The abstraction in Fig. 1 can be merged again with a new atomic abstraction {a mathematical formula}π3.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In SM&S abstract state spaces, however, the transitions are different than in the original state space.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, there are several domains where it is harmful for Gamer 's PDB selection.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Coverage of {a mathematical formula}A⁎ search with symbolic perimeter abstraction heuristics</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These two edges correspond to the two cells with value 1 in the table representing {a mathematical formula}α2, since 0-edges correspond to {a mathematical formula}vi=0 and 1-edges to {a mathematical formula}vi=1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This perimeter corresponds to a regression search in the original state space, so that no abstraction is used to relax the search yet.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In our example, {a mathematical formula}γbisim corresponds to bisimulation shrinking, which in this case considers that all packages are interchangeable so {a mathematical formula}γbisim(2)=γbisim(6)=2 and abstract state {a mathematical formula}s2α1 corresponds to states in which {a mathematical formula}(v1=L∧v2=R)∨(v1=R∧v2=L).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">ADDs can describe integer functions, {a mathematical formula}fS(x1…xn):S→Z, such as heuristic functions.</a>
