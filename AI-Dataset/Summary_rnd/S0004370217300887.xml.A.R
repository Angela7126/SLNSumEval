<a href="#0" id="0">In this order, {a mathematical formula}s1 is searched before {a mathematical formula}s2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">After enforcing GAC to each constraint in the constraint store using EnforceConsistency(), we need to check whether some recorded assignments in T are violated or not by calling CheckT() (line 10), where the violated assignments are recorded into VT (line 10).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This demonstrates that our methods are competitive against state of the art symmetry breaking methods also in solving optimization problems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Both ReSBDS and LexLeader return 1 solution, but LexLeader only has the root node while ReSBDS has an extra search node.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus only rx and ry can be broken by SBC.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, both generator symmetries are broken, no symmetry breaking constraints are added.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">‚äÅs)m1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Flener et al. [63] also propose dominance detection search for other tractable symmetries such as piecewise variable and value symmetry.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence, ReSBDS is strictly stronger.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This prunes value 1 from {a mathematical formula}D(x6).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The concert halls are interchangeable, and so are applications within each partition.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">solutions) pruned by {a mathematical formula}m2 would also be pruned by {a mathematical formula}m1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Since value symmetries are inactive symmetries, LDSB needs to be given only the adjacent value interchangeabilities by similar reasoning.</a>
