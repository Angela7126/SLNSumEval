<a href="#0" id="0">The case where {a mathematical formula}Bd(r) is f w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Introduction Motivated by the Semantic Web and other applications that require features from both rules and ontological reasoning, researchers have studied ways to combine rules with description logics (DLs), and in general with decidable first-order theories or external reasoning sources (e.g., [5], [8], [11], [12], [16], [18], [19]).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By definition, the only reason for the inequality is because {a mathematical formula}P//T⊂P/T, which causes {a mathematical formula}ΓK′(T)⊂ΓK(T).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let S be a subset of {a mathematical formula}KA(K).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let{a mathematical formula}K=(O,P)be a hybrid MKNF knowledge base and{a mathematical formula}(T,P)a partition of{a mathematical formula}KA(K)such that{a mathematical formula}OBO,Pis satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We show that, for the partition {a mathematical formula}(T′,P), condition (3) of Definition 11 does not hold and thus {a mathematical formula}(T,P) cannot be a stable partition.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If{a mathematical formula}Kis MKNF-coherent, a well-founded MKNF model exists, which is unique and equals{a mathematical formula}({I|I⊨OBO,Pω},{I|I⊨OBO,Nω}).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The next section introduces MKNF and its three-valued extension, followed by Section 3 which introduces the well-founded semantics for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">E is an empty rule set, i.e., {a mathematical formula}P//E=∅.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus its occurrence in the body of the second rule can be ignored.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">□ Continuing with Example 2 (also referring to Example 1), we know that the well-founded partition of {a mathematical formula}K is {a mathematical formula}(Pω,Nω)=({Ka,Kb,Kc},{Ka,Kb,Kc,Kd,Ke}).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}(T′,P′) is “complete” in the sense that it incorporates the effect of reasoning with {a mathematical formula}O, in which case rule evaluation coincides with the evaluation by the corresponding structure.</a>
