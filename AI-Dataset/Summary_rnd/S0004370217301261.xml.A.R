<a href="#0" id="0">In fact, if ties are broken in Open in favor of small h-values, the goal node with {a mathematical formula}f=C⁎ could be expanded as soon as it is generated, and such savings of {a mathematical formula}h2 will be obtained for some nodes with {a mathematical formula}f1=C⁎ too.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To further understand the differences between the search algorithms, we compare the geometric mean of the number of expanded nodes in each search algorithm (Table A.16 shows per-domain results).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In such cases where {a mathematical formula}f1(n)<fbest we can choose to compute {a mathematical formula}h2(n) right away (after Line 13 in Algorithm 1), thus saving the overhead of inserting n into Open and popping it again at the next step ({a mathematical formula}=2×to).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast, although selective max uses a much more complicated decision rule, it chooses which heuristic to compute when n is first generated, and does not know whether {a mathematical formula}h1 will be informative enough to prune n.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In other words, TS1 simply learns the conditional distribution table of {a mathematical formula}h2 as a function of {a mathematical formula}h1.</a>
