<a href="#0" id="0">Qualitative predictive models in their original form are a substitute for regression models.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It seems that the right rail-first shot should be preferred from the others in a similar way that the left rail-first shot is preferred in the previous situation above.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The basic difference between these approaches and ours is that these methods are concerned with optimizing the accuracy of predictions and not with estimations of the chosen attribute's influence on the target class probability.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Next we merge {a mathematical formula}v4 and {a mathematical formula}v5, the average probability is {a mathematical formula}0.5+0.6=0.55.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For each set of parameters (N, #atts, μ) we sampled ten data sets, computed the PDQ PDs {a mathematical formula}@f=1@Ai, for {a mathematical formula}i∈{1,2,3}, and induced the qualitative models using the C4.5 algorithm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It is irrelevant whether ball R is present or not because it can only block the right rail-first shot which has the lowest preference in any case.</a>
