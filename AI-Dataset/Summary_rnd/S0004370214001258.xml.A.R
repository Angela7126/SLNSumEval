<a href="#0" id="0">This example illustrates a graceful degradation of the results, especially when the cumulative results of the five most probable joint value assignments are compared.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Membership in {a mathematical formula}NPPPPP follows from the following algorithm: non-deterministically guess a value assignment h, and test whether there are at least k joint value assignments {a mathematical formula}i− to {a mathematical formula}I− such that {a mathematical formula}Pr(h,i−,e)>q.</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">However, the error margin ϵ can be made sufficiently low by choosing N large enough.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When determining what is the best explanation, typically we also need to consider other variables that are not directly observed, nor are to be explained: the intermediate variables.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given the theoretical considerations in [14] it seems plausible that the decisiveness constraint is met in many practical situations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the random networks used in the simulations, the average probability of the most probable explanation was 0.0245, which would yield an unpractical exponent of {a mathematical formula}log⁡0.0245log⁡0.9755≈150.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given uniformly distributed binary state transitions this is exactly the case if the majority of computation paths accepts.</a>
