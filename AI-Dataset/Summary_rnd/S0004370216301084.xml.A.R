<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:3} Nevertheless, if one only cares about the outcome quality and the quality is measured by the price of anarchy [30] with the average individual cost, it is known that the price of total anarchy achieved by such no-regret algorithms can still match the price of anarchy at Nash equilibrium in special games, such as atomic congestion games [11] or even a wider class of smooth games [36].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this article, we first consider the nonatomic congestion game described by {a mathematical formula}(N,E,(Si)i∈N,(ce)e∈E), where N is the set of commodities, E is the set of edges (resources), {a mathematical formula}Si⊆2E is the collection of the allowed paths (the allowed subsets of resources) for commodity i, and {a mathematical formula}ce is the cost function of edge e, which is a nondecreasing function of the amount of load on it.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, it is known that by choosing {a mathematical formula}Ri(ui)=‖ui‖22/2 to have {a mathematical formula}BRi(xi,yi)=‖xi−yi‖22/2, one recovers the gradient descent algorithm, while by choosing {a mathematical formula}Ri(ui)=∑s(ui,sln⁡ui,s−ui,s) to have {a mathematical formula}BRi(xi,yi)=∑sxi,sln⁡(xi,s/yi,s), one recovers the multiplicative updates algorithm.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that Theorem 17 follows immediately from Theorem 19.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that this corresponds to choosing {a mathematical formula}Ri(ui)=‖ui‖22/2 for each i, and one can show that {a mathematical formula}BRi(ui,vi)=‖ui−vi‖22/2, for {a mathematical formula}ui,vi∈Ki.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Implication of the convergence, including approximate equilibria and guarantees regarding social costs, will be discussed in Section 4.3.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then we can conclude that their distributions at step t are all the same,{sup:12} which basically can be described by the flow {a mathematical formula}xit of player i, due to the law of large number as the number of agents is huge.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">To apply Theorem 6, let us choose a player i with {a mathematical formula}xi,s1>0; such a player must exist because otherwise there would be no load on {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}cs1(x)=0 could not be the highest path cost.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Even in the latter case, those time steps where flows are close to equilibria are arbitrarily distributed over time (not guaranteed to gather toward the end in time), which means that a flow at some very late point in time can still be far away from any equilibria and flows may not stabilize.</a>
