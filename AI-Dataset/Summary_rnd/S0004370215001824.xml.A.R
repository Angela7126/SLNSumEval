<a href="#0" id="0">Consequently, a number of automated algorithm configuration and parameter tuning approaches have been proposed over the last decade.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Table 13, Table 14, we show the results of ISAC+2014 at MSE14.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The new portfolio stage in ISAC++ helps invoke these automatically generated parameterizations when they are best suited for a given instance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Throughout this paper, we use GGA to tune instance-obliviously, and CSHC for algorithm selection.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Depending on the particular problem instance being solved, it is more important to emphasize one or the other of these inherent aspects.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">ISAC-GGA, which instance-specifically tunes only QMaxSat without using other solvers, solves 78%.</a>
