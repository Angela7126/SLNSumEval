<a href="#0" id="0">Let P be an evolving logic program over {a mathematical formula}L, {a mathematical formula}I=〈I1,…,Im〉 an evolution interpretation of length m of P with evolution trace {a mathematical formula}PI=〈P1,…,Pm〉, and {a mathematical formula}E=〈E1,…,Eℓ〉 an event sequence over P such that {a mathematical formula}ℓ≥m.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Update functionLet {a mathematical formula}M=〈C,IL,BR〉 be an rMCS such that {a mathematical formula}C=〈C1,…,Cn〉, {a mathematical formula}KB=〈kb1,…,kbn〉 a configuration of knowledge bases for M, {a mathematical formula}I an input for M, and {a mathematical formula}B a belief state for M. Then, the update function for M is defined as {a mathematical formula}updM(KB,I,B)=〈kb1′,…,kbn′〉, such that, for each {a mathematical formula}i∈{1…,n}, {a mathematical formula}kbi′=mngi(appinext(I,B),kbi).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The second notion describes cycles between contexts which may be a cause of inconsistency.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Unfortunately, checking for reducibility cannot be done a priori as the {a mathematical formula}KB will only be known at runtime (due to 3. of Definition 21).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Appendix C) and thus for performing multi-purpose computations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">One way of avoiding nondeterminism is by applying an alternative, skeptical semantics.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We would also like to explore giving bridge rules access to the entire belief set of another context or an input and not just to one element.</a>
