<a href="#0" id="0">Because only one search round is allowed, both the threshold-based sampling and fixed size sampling must be conducted simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The expected cost of using such a sequence can be calculated using (4).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order for the searcher to refine the population of agents whose values it obtains, it can publish a maximum threshold r on the agentsʼ values, denoted a reservation value, requesting to communicate only with agents that comply with that threshold.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then, instead of processing all of the responses, the searcher processes the responses sequentially as long as the revealed value so far is above some reservation value.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First we prove that {a mathematical formula}[xmax] is the optimal strategy if {a mathematical formula}β(i)=0.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that{a mathematical formula} By substituting {a mathematical formula}F(ri|ri−1) with {a mathematical formula}F(ri′|ri−1′) in (5), we obtain {a mathematical formula}V(Si′)=V(ri−1)(Si).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Iterative deepening, iterative broadening, and expanding ring search share the same cost model: The cost of each round includes the cost of revisiting all previously visited nodes as well as the cost of visiting new nodes.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As a result, the expected cost increases due to the increase in the expected number of rounds.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In many multi-agent systems (MAS), it is often necessary to find the agent associated with the best value (lowest or highest, depending on the application) amongst a set of agents, each associated with some value to the searcher.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The first two terms in (21) reflect the expected value of the opportunity returned by the search and the third term is the expected cost of obtaining the values.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Another well-studied strategy is the California split rule [3].</a>
