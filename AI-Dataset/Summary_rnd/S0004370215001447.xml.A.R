<a href="#0" id="0">Given that arc costs for {a mathematical formula}(1,2,3,4,1) and {a mathematical formula}(1,4,3,2,1) sum to 8 or 7, respectively, only the answer set representing {a mathematical formula}(1,4,3,2,1) in terms of the atoms {a mathematical formula}hc(1,4), {a mathematical formula}hc(4,3), {a mathematical formula}hc(3,2), and {a mathematical formula}hc(2,1) is optimal.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The memory overhead incurred by the normalization of aggregates and/or translation to the formalisms of other back–end solvers can be observed in the second and fourth to eighth row.</a>
