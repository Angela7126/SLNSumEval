<a href="#0" id="0">Then in Lines 9 through 15, Find-Acceptable-Plan iterates over the actions, adding them to the current plan p and updating the current state s. If {a mathematical formula}ai¯ leads to a state already seen in p or to a known-unsolvable state in K, or if its nondeterministic counterpart {a mathematical formula}ai leads to a state in U, then Find-Acceptable-Plan inserts {a mathematical formula}(s,ai¯) into B and stops integrating q (without removing already integrated actions).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The well-known MBP planner uses BDDs to compute abstractions that are significantly more powerful than ours—but since our abstractions do not use BDDs, they preserve NDP2's ability to be used with any classical planner.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Formally, a plan is a sequence {a mathematical formula}p=〈a1,…,ak〉 of classical actions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition to testing the algorithms on Robot Navigation problems, we also tested them on abstract and compound-abstract versions of the problems.</a>
