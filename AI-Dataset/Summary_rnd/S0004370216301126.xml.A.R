<a href="#0" id="0">In the presence of money, intuitively, chances for finding an envy-free solution are better than when there is no money.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is why we have required initial payments for our convergence results.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper we study convergence properties for distributed allocation mechanisms when used as fair division procedures.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} Here op may stand for either raw or bool.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Global inefficiency of clique-wise efficiencyIf the negotiation topology is not complete, then the social welfare of a clique-wise efficient allocation can be arbitrarily far from the optimum.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Path length for line topologySuppose the negotiation topology{a mathematical formula}G=(N,E)is a line:{a mathematical formula}E={(i,j)∈N2‖i−j|=1}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Besides proportionality, another important fairness criterion is envy-freeness[30], [3], [11], [10].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note that the proposed mechanism never requires heavy central computation: only some simple redistribution of the social surplus (in terms of money) is performed at the global level.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We will frequently rely on this fact in the sequel, mostly without explicit reference to Lemma 3.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We now develop a notion of efficiency that takes the negotiation topology into account and relate this notion to IR negotiation when restricted to clique-deals.</a>
