<a href="#0" id="0">Therefore, we can conclude that {a mathematical formula}S⋅Rj≤Rj⋅S for any {a mathematical formula}j∈J.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The notion of regular equivalence has been studied extensively in social network analysis, and it has found many applications in block modeling, network clustering, role or position identification, and so on.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, Theorem 6 would no longer hold if we were to make such modifications.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Although there are several definitions of regular equivalence, we only consider two of them in this paper.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since U is finite, for any {a mathematical formula}x,z∈U, there exist {a mathematical formula}x0 and {a mathematical formula}z0 such that {a mathematical formula}(x,x0)∈E, {a mathematical formula}(z,z0)∈E,{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} Because {a mathematical formula}(x,x0)∈E and {a mathematical formula}(z,z0)∈E, by the second condition of GRE, we have{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} which imply{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, the social network considered in this paper is a structure {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i∈I,(Rj)j∈J), where the universe U is a finite set of actors; {a mathematical formula}Pi⊆U for all {a mathematical formula}i∈I; and {a mathematical formula}Rj⊆U×U for all {a mathematical formula}j∈J.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, the Gödel negation can be defined as {a mathematical formula}Δ¬φ in {a mathematical formula}ŁΔ(□◇).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Another case of privacy invasion occurs when there exists an equivalence class {a mathematical formula}X⊆U such that for all {a mathematical formula}u∈X, {a mathematical formula}Pi(u) is the same for some {a mathematical formula}i∈Is.</a>
