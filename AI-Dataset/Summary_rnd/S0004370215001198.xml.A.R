<a href="#0" id="0">Then, coalitions of the same coalition-type have the same value.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We discussed in this article four alternative representations to CFGs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Such a game is given by a pair, {a mathematical formula}(A,w), where A is the set of agents and w is a function—called the partition function—that maps each embedded coalition, {a mathematical formula}(C,CS), to its value, {a mathematical formula}w((C,CS)).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This means {a mathematical formula}V(CS⁎)maxCS∈Π1A∪Π2A⁡V(CS)≤n.As for the number of searched coalition structures, it suffices to note that: {a mathematical formula}Π1A∪Π2A=∪C⊆N:a1∈C{C,A\C}, and so that number is: {a mathematical formula}|C⊆N:a1∈C|=2n−1.Finally, we need to prove that for every set of coalition structures {a mathematical formula}X≠Π1A∪Π2A whose search establishes a bound, the following holds: {a mathematical formula}|X|>2n−1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}A={a1,a2,a3,a4,a5} and {a mathematical formula}SCG={({a1},0), {a mathematical formula}({a2},0), {a mathematical formula}({a3},1), {a mathematical formula}({a4},2), {a mathematical formula}({a5},1), {a mathematical formula}({a1,a2},3), {a mathematical formula}({a1,a2,a3},3)}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In particular, once the algorithm completes searching level {a mathematical formula}ΠiA, the bound becomes {a mathematical formula}β=⌊n/h⌋, where {a mathematical formula}h=⌊(n−i)/2⌋+2.</a>
