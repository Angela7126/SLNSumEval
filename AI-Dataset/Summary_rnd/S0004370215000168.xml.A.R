<a href="#1" id="1">The strategy generally formulated as the following optimization problem,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}R(b,bt) denotes a regularization term and {a mathematical formula}η>0 denotes the learning rate.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Table 6 illustrates the main results of this study, that is, the cumulative wealth on the six datasets achieved by various approaches.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that in the derivations we do not consider the non-negativity constraint following Helmbold et al. [37].</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">DJIA contains 507 trading days, ranging from Jan.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In a word, the proposed OLMAR can outperform the state of the art on the widely used datasets with a high confidence.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The rest of the paper is organized as follows.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">ONS' regret bound is {a mathematical formula}O(mlog⁡n), which is the same to Cover's UP.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For BAH(OLMAR), we set their maximum window size {a mathematical formula}W=30, resulting in 28 OLMAR experts with {a mathematical formula}w=3 to 30.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">After that, we sequentially introduce three main categories of existing approaches, that is, “Follow-the-Winner”, “Follow-the-Loser”, and “Pattern-Matching” based approaches.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The results clearly show that OLMAR achieves the best performance among all competitors.</a>
