<a href="#0" id="0">In particular, just as with a real biped robot (or a human), this simulated humanoid will fall if inappropriate control commands are provided.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to understand which control policies are available to the dispatcher, recall Definition 17, which is utilized for plan compilation to determine valid compile time duration ranges for activities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For linear systems, optimal controllers such as LQR controllers can be synthesized analytically.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Event HorizonAn Event Horizon is a set of Event Paths, each of which is a list of events and associated target execution windows.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We use the QSP representation to elevate the level of command of hybrid systems to the task level, while allowing the controller full latitude in responding to disturbances safely.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">With this approach, a plant model is used to continually predict and optimize future state and control actions over a limited (receding) horizon.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this case, however, the PD tracking controller, rather than the model-based executive, is used to handle the disturbance.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Plan compilation</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Suppose, further, thatxis a disturbed state.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The linearization and decoupling are provided by a Whole-body Controller [4], a component of the Model-based Executive.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Second, we extend compilation approaches developed for temporally flexible execution of discrete activity plans to work with hybrid discrete/continuous systems using a recently developed Linear Quadratic Regulator synthesis algorithm, which performs a state reachability analysis to prune infeasible trajectories, and which determines optimal control policies for feasible state regions.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Suppose that control policy{a mathematical formula}P(tf,x), achieved by cross section{a mathematical formula}cdaccording toLemma 4, is being used to execute the activity.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This follows from Lemma 4, and Theorem 3.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Also, temporal constraints are not considered.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Thus, our algorithms focus on synchronization of movement of the forward and lateral CM components with the movement of the stepping foot, which are the key variables to control for successful locomotion.</a>
