<a href="#0" id="0">By Definition 3, to prove that {a mathematical formula}ΦR is a transition function for {a mathematical formula}R, we need to prove that {a mathematical formula}BS(ΦR(a,φ))=Φ(a,BS(φ)).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We observe that these new problems worsen the performance of most existing planners, but they do not seem to affect the performance of Dnf as shown in Table 4.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A set of literals X is said to be consistent if X does not contain a pair of complementary literals, i.e., for every literal ℓ in X, {a mathematical formula}ℓ‾∉X.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We implemented the Dnf planner by modifying the CpA system [29], [38].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Observe that, after insertion of a sequence of actions β into α, the new sequence may be no longer a solution for {a mathematical formula}P′, as the execution of β can destroy some literals that are useful for the achievement of the goal of {a mathematical formula}P′.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The experimental evaluation shows that the three systems are very competitive with other planners.</a>
