<a href="#0" id="0">For example instance 10 was solved in 187 s by the Min implementation and 147 s (169 s when including the cost of building the propagator tree) with propagator trees.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Propagator trees</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These approaches can typically enforce GAC in polynomial time when their data structure is of polynomial size (whether it is a list of tuples, a trie, an MDD or a finite automaton).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This can be compared to the bound of {a mathematical formula}O(2nd) derived in Section 4.1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This extended algorithm is implemented in the GAP computational algebra system [25].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Comparing MDDC to Table, the results are also broadly similar.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We use the SMF heuristic for all experiments in Sections 5 and 8.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The prunings are stored in the current tree node, and each pruned value is removed from SD to form {a mathematical formula}SD′.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The problem of size {a mathematical formula}n×n (i.e. live cells are contained within an {a mathematical formula}n×n bounding box at each time step) and period p is represented by a 3-dimensional array of Boolean variables {a mathematical formula}b[n+4,n+4,p] indexed (from 0) by position i, j and time step t. To enforce the bounding box, for each t, the rows 0, 1, {a mathematical formula}n+2 and {a mathematical formula}n+3 are set to 0.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, this would introduce a substantial inefficiency, particularly for Apply which is very heavily used.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The second line indicates that most of the relations have only one scope.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To address this problem, we first assume that the representation is the virtual machine instructions given in Sections 3.5.2 and 7.3.1.</a>
