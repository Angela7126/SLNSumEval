<a href="#0" id="0">Different global constraints are developed, each one aims at exploiting more efficiently an n-ary relation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The first solution found is quite good in general.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}V3′.lb is the sum of the first {a mathematical formula}f(|U∖{i}|,k) elements that are related to {a mathematical formula}U∖{i} in the increasingly ordered array ord.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our models, which exploits the benefits of Constraint Programming such as constraint propagation and appropriate search strategies, are more efficient.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If another condition is added, requiring the size of each group to be at least 2, only solution 5 is found.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">First model</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Assume that 7 points are grouped and 7 are not.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">When the constraints are tight, most of those algorithms may not find a solution that satisfies all the constraints even if such a solution exists.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Considering Data Mining as an iterative and interactive process composed of the classical steps of task formulation, data preparation, application of a tool, thus requiring to set parameters, and validation of the results, a user can specify the task at hand including or not some constraints and decide to change the settings according to the results.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the first experiment, {a mathematical formula}kmax is set to 10 and {a mathematical formula}kmin varies from 2 to 10.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We compare this model with existing exact approaches, based either on a branch-and-bound approach [4] or on graph coloring [5] on twelve datasets.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Since the constants {a mathematical formula}d(i,j) ({a mathematical formula}i,j∈U, {a mathematical formula}i<j) must be ordered increasingly for the computation of {a mathematical formula}V3.lb, they are ordered once in the array ord, and at the same time the arrays px and py are constructed.</a>
