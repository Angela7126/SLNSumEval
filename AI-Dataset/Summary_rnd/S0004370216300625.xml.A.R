<a href="#0" id="0">pfolioUZK[70] follows the same idea as used for ppfolio but uses other component solvers; it won the parallel track of the 2012 SAT Challenge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Table 5 shows the performance of clasp's default portfolio with clause sharing, Default-MP(8)+CS; the portfolio originally returned by parHydra, which does not perform clause sharing, parHydra-MP(8); the application of clasp's default clause sharing and preprocessing settings to the original parHydra portfolio, parHydra-MP(8)+defCS; and the parHydra portfolio with newly configured clause sharing and preprocessing settings, parHydra-MP(8)+confCS.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Indeed, the majority of our SMAC runs (7 out of 10) found similarly performing portfolios after their last iterations (with a difference of less than 1 CPU seconds), and one of these 7 portfolios showed the overall best performance on our training set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The procedure is greedy in the sense that in each iteration i, it attempts to add a component solver to the given portfolio {a mathematical formula}cˆ1:i−1 in a way that myopically optimizes the performance of the new portfolio {a mathematical formula}cˆ1:i (Line 4).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Configuration of clause sharing can be directly integrated in Global and parHydra by adding the corresponding parameters to the configuration space, because the solvers actually run in parallel.</a>
