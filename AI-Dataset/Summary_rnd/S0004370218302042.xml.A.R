<a href="#1" id="1">The weight assigned to a pure strategy s by a mixed strategy σ, or {a mathematical formula}P(s|σ), is called the strategy weight of s.An n-tuple of mixed strategies, {a mathematical formula}σ∈P(S), is called a mixed-strategy profile.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is clearly an avenue that bears further enquiry.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a history table T, we write {a mathematical formula}ν2(T,i,j) to refer to the truth assignment that sets {a mathematical formula}〚Timek2‾〛=i, {a mathematical formula}〚Tapek2‾〛=j, and the other variables to the encoding of the local square with upper left {a mathematical formula}(i,j).</a>
