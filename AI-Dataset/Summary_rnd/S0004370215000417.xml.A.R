<a href="#0" id="0">It should be noted that the heuristic methods for finding valid BNs will also have an effect on how well close cuts work.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Formulating the problem in such a way means that highly optimised off-the-shelf ILP solvers can be used and that decades of research in ILP optimisation can be used to improve the speed of the search for the optimal BN.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The features examined in this way are</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For a BN with just 4 nodes, Matti JÃ¤rvisalo used cdd{sup:3} to show that there are 64 different facets to the convex hull, {a mathematical formula}P4.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As the current relaxed LP solution is an upper bound on the optimal solution, the values of the heuristic solution and relaxed LP solution together allow one to see how much better than the current heuristic solution the optimal solution might be.</a>
