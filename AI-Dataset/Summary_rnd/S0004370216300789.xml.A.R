<a href="#0" id="0">However, the execution steps of a norm-based multi-agent environment program proceed by enforcing norms to the resulting program states.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, if a mechanism design analysis of the ramp merging scenario shows that a set of traffic norms implements the system designer's objective to avoid traffic congestion (i.e., to avoid simultaneous arrival of cars at the merging point m) assuming that cars follow their Nash equilibrium strategies, then one can use the specification language to simulate the scenario in order to verify whether the enforcement of the traffic norms avoids traffic congestion.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We start with reviewing concepts from classical mechanism design and introducing corresponding concepts for norm-based mechanism design.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have to show that for all {a mathematical formula}N∈Nrs there is an {a mathematical formula}s∈NE(Mˆϕˆ↾N,q0,(γˆˆv,γˆˆr)) such that {a mathematical formula}(⋆){a mathematical formula}outMˆϕˆ↾N(q0,s)⊨LTL(ass∧tick)→(¬◇winv∧¬◯d).Firstly, suppose that {a mathematical formula}Mˆϕˆ↾N contains a path {a mathematical formula}λ∈ΛMˆϕˆ↾N(q0) with {a mathematical formula}λ⊨¬tick.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Update order with sanctioning and regimenting normsWe consider the CGS {a mathematical formula}M shown in Fig. 9 and update it with {a mathematical formula}SN={(qˆ,{a},{s})} and {a mathematical formula}RN={(qˆ,{a},⊥)} in different orders, and at once ({a mathematical formula}qˆ is a propositional formula that is true only in state q), respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This part of the model is called value choice section and consists of states{a mathematical formula} States {a mathematical formula}qi with {a mathematical formula}1≤i≤m are controlled by v, states with {a mathematical formula}m+1≤i≤n are controlled by r. Afterwards, both agents simulate the game theoretic semantics of propositional logic.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, we give the semantics in more general terms because it shall later prove convenient when relating the setting to mechanism design.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As the fulfilment of agents' preferences depends on the valuation of states on a path, agents' behaviour may be affected if imposing norms and sanctions would cause a modification of states' valuations.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By Lemma 19 and Proposition 20 we can construct a model {a mathematical formula}Mˆϕ from a ∀QSAT2-formula ϕ in polynomial time such that:{a mathematical formula} □ Proofs of implementation problems: existence</a>
