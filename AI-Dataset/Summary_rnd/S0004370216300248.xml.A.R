<a href="#0" id="0">In the experiments, all supports (and minimum supports) are calculated in terms of the percentage of the frequency {a mathematical formula}|<s>| of a pattern s compared to the number of sequences {a mathematical formula}|D| in the database.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By contrast, s is infrequent if {a mathematical formula}sup(s)<min_sup.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The non-occurrence of some medical service codes in claim transactions may indicate problems (such as fraud) in service procedures, protheses or specific diseases.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When neg-size(NSC) = 3, we need to calculate the union set of 3-size PSP since size(1-{a mathematical formula}negMSnsc) = 3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The above discussions about negative containment and existing NSP research involve the key issue of various constraints applied to NSP mining.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">e-NSP is also used to detect fraudulent claims in health insurance data.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For simplicity, we often omit “positive” when discussing positive items, positive elements and positive sequences in mining PSP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This algorithm first discovers PSP by GSP, then generates and prunes NSC.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For example, 318 sequences contain more than 20 items.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}EidSns−={(¬(cd),2)}.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">When the minimum support is substantially reduced, more patterns are exponentially generated.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Continuous negative elements in a NSC are not allowed.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For e-NSP, although C does not directly appear in Equation (20), increasing C will result in the increase of m and {a mathematical formula}sup‾(PSPi−m+1) to some degree.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">e-NSP data structure and optimization</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Such problems cannot be handled by the identification of occurring behavior patterns alone.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula}ns=<(de)¬(cd)>.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">min_sup is a minimum support threshold predefined by users.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The support of a negative sequence {a mathematical formula}<¬e> is calculated by Equation (4), as in e-NSP.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Discovering NSP is becoming increasingly important, and sometimes play a role that cannot be replaced by analyzing occurring behaviors alone in many intelligent systems and applications, such as intelligent transport systems (ITS), health and medical management systems, bioinformatics, biomedical systems, risk management, counter-terrorism, and security.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">As discussed in Section 5.3, the impact of data factors on computational performance of NSP mining is very complicated.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Let {a mathematical formula}|PSPk| denote the number of all {a mathematical formula}k−size PSPs in database D and the maximum size of PSPs be k. The number of NSCs generated from all {a mathematical formula}k−size PSPs is {a mathematical formula}|PSPk|⁎|NSCk,∀m|.</a>
