<a href="#1" id="1">First, observe that Pearl's semantics (both 0 and 1 entailment) cannot cope with conditionals having an inconsistent antecedent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, in {a mathematical formula}M, the rank of all elements in {a mathematical formula}Min<(BI) is ≥i, and also {a mathematical formula}Mi⊨ALC+TRT(B)⊑D.To prove that {a mathematical formula}Mi⊨ALC+TREi, we also need to show that {a mathematical formula}Mi⊨ALC+TRABoxi.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The nonmonotonic mechanism proposed by the authors corresponds to an algorithm to compute inferences, however, as a difference with our proposal, no declarative characterization of those inferences is provided.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Although it is arguable whether, KLM systems, and in particular R, represent adequately all types of nonmonotonic inferences,{sup:1} we think that KLM systems and the strongest R in particular, are still a significant proposal for nonmonotonic reasoning for two reasons: (a) on a theoretical level, they define a set of inferential properties which are useful (even if not necessarily wanted) to classify and analyze concrete nonmonotonic inference, (b) they provide a simple and direct language to express plausible inferences and to reason about them.</a>
