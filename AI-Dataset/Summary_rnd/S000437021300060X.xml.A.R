<a href="#0" id="0">In order to characterize soundness for additive implication for several inference systems, we introduce the zero-density property.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The falsification criterion and the two heuristics we consider are formally exhibited in Algorithms 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 7).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is an adaptation of Example 6.3 in [6].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We add to this a novel inference system, referred to as System {a mathematical formula}A, with which we compare the existing ones on a purely syntactic level.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Now, let {a mathematical formula}X∈Ω(2), {a mathematical formula}X≠U.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Clearly, we have the following.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The multi-information function induced by P is the real-valued function {a mathematical formula}MP:2S→R defined by{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">They also have the same associated vector.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence, he reduced the multiplication-based probabilistic CI implication problem to an addition-based implication problem.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As it is generally known that there does not exist a finite, sound and complete axiomatization for probabilistic conditional independence implication [6], we can try to do the next best thing, which is enclosing the problem between a “lower bound”, that is, a finite set of inference rules that is sound, and an “upper bound”, a finite set of inference rules that is complete.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">If{a mathematical formula}Ais sound for the additive implication problem{a mathematical formula}(Csat,Call)Fand complete for the additive implication problem{a mathematical formula}(Csat,Csat)F, then{a mathematical formula}Ais complete for the additive implication problem{a mathematical formula}(Call,Call)F.</a>
