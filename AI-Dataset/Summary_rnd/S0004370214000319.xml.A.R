<a href="#0" id="0">We see that {a mathematical formula}{ε} is the only nonempty admissible set, and hence also the only preferred extension and ideal extension of {a mathematical formula}CAF[∅].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It follows that any such α is attacked by {a mathematical formula}(E1∪E2) in {a mathematical formula}AF′ and hence {a mathematical formula}(E1∪E2)∈EST(AF′), i.e. {a mathematical formula}CEST(AF′)⊆EST(AF′).Considering now a generic stable extension {a mathematical formula}S∈EST(AF′), we have to show that {a mathematical formula}(S∩Au)∈EST(AFu) and that {a mathematical formula}(S∩Aa)∈EST(CAF[S∩Au]).As to the first point, since S is conflict-free in {a mathematical formula}AF′, obviously {a mathematical formula}(S∩Au) is conflict-free in {a mathematical formula}AFu.</a>
