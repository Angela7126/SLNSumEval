<a href="#1" id="1">Finally, another significant contribution of this paper, is the proposal of two system of spheres-based constructive methods for defining multiple contractions and the proof that the two classes of functions that arise of those methods (differ from the class of spheres filtration-based multiple contractions presented in [17], [5] and) are subsumed by the class of transitively relational partial meet multiple contractions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, having in mind the two above defined binary relations {a mathematical formula}⊑S1 and {a mathematical formula}⊑S2 we have that:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Next we show that not only the construction of spheres filtration-based multiple contractions proposed in [17], [5] fails to generate all TRPMMCs (cf.</a>
