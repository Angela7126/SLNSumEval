<a href="#0" id="0">A solid line now represents a partial solution.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, from Proposition 13 we can deduce that satisfiability is preserved by this merging operation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, given a solution to the instance resulting from the merging of two values, we can find a solution to the original instance in linear time.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}D(yij)) contains only two values {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}bi (resp.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, once {a mathematical formula}a,b∈D(x) are merged, the resulting new value c is compatible with all assignments to all other variables.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To complete the set of variables in {a mathematical formula}ICSP, we add three special variables {a mathematical formula}v,w,z.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The BTP itself has also been directly generalised in several different ways.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Suppose that instance I contains only binary difference constraints{a mathematical formula}x≠y.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To test the utility of BTP-merging we performed extensive experimental trials on CSP benchmark instances available from the International CP Competition.</a>
