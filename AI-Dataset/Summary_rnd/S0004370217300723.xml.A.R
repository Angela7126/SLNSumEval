<a href="#0" id="0">Then, for any agent i in N we have {a mathematical formula}B(∇(Ei,E′))≡B(∇(Ei′,E′)).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}Ew,w′ be an epistemic state satisfying {a mathematical formula}〚B(Ew,w′)〛={w,w′}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This postulate corresponds to Postulate (IC5) of IC merging operators.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A quasi-syncretic assignment is a function mapping each profile Ψ to a total pre-order {a mathematical formula}≤Ψ over interpretations satisfying conditions 1–5 (above) plus the following condition (a weakening of condition 6):</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, there are dictatorial operators for which (ESF-U) does not hold (see Section 5).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We say that D is a locally decisive N-coalition for E against {a mathematical formula}E′, with respect to ∇, denoted by {a mathematical formula}ED∇E′, if for each N-profile Φ satisfying:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">All merging operators considered in this framework are functions from the set of profiles and the set of propositional formulae (that will represent integrity constraints) to the set of belief bases, i.e. {a mathematical formula}Δ:G×LP↦LP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It is also clear that the images of formulas of 4 and 3 models can not cover any shape of types {a mathematical formula}S2 and {a mathematical formula}S3.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The next result gives a simplification of the Postulate (ESF-I) for the ES basic fusion operators and also a semantic characterization.</a>
