<a href="#0" id="0">If α maps all variables to a Boolean value, it is complete.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Now we focus on the comparison between Swcc and Swtabu.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on the above considerations, we propose a new variable property called subscore.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 13 also reports for each solver the averaged run time along with standard deviation, and the median time over all runs, all of which confirm the significant superiority of CCASat over other solvers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As is usual in local search algorithms, there is a trade-off between the accuracy of heuristics and the complexity per step.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For the 5SAT-v1500 instances, CCAsubscore is about two times faster than Sparrow2011 and probSAT, eight times faster than sattime, and four times faster than Eagle.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Also, one can modify the variable selection heuristic in the random mode, and various techniques such as clause weighting schemes can be used in this framework.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Based on this observation, we conjecture that for SAT local search algorithms, if each variableʼs neighborhood is less than 0.25n, it is better to utilize the CC strategy than the tabu method, and otherwise the tabu method is of more benefit.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For a variable {a mathematical formula}x∈V(F), if the configuration of x has not been changed (in this work, this means none of its neighboring variables has been flipped) since its last flip, then it is forbidden to be flipped.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In some sense, the above definition of critical clauses is an extended version of a concept also named critical clauses proposed in the theory community [38], which is restricted to satisfying assignments (i.e., a clause is critical if there is exactly one true literal in that clause under a satisfying assignment).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The modification seems relatively small at first glance.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We note that the CC strategy is novel in local search algorithms for SAT.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Recall that the CC strategy forbids a variable to be flipped if since its last flip, none of its neighboring variables has been flipped.</a>
