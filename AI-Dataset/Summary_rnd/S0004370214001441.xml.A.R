<a href="#2" id="2">The two other basic operations in feature terms are unification (also known as the lss, or the least special specialization) and antiunification (also known as the lgg, or the least general generalization).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Notice that thanks to this “reachable” concept most variables in the matrix can be directly set to zero in most cases, making the CSP faster to solve.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In practice, n varies from a few variables in simple machine learning problems to up to hundreds or thousands for complex biomedical datasets.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Using a CP-based approach, all instances were solved in less than 0.1 seconds.</a>
