<a href="#1" id="1">The pure-strategy perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium analysis as well as a procedure for its efficient calculation as a function of the information pricing are given in Section 3.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">□</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The first is explained by the fact that when the level of heterogeneity between the agents increases, the valuation of the bidder that values the item most also increases.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For {a mathematical formula}C=0.93 that solution is no longer stable, as the auctioneer has an incentive to deviate to {a mathematical formula}(∅,{2,4}) which offers her a greater expected benefit.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Auctioneer's side</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We now move on to investigating the effect of bidders' awareness of the option to purchase the information over the different players' expected benefit.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The effect of the different model parameters</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Some of them are in contrast to those characterizing traditional auction models (e.g., having more bidders participate in the auction is not necessarily in the auctioneer's best interest, and having less bidders is not necessarily in the bidders' best interest; having the option to purchase the information (at all or at a reduced price) can actually result in a degradation in the auctioneer's expected benefit).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore, bidders' dominating (or “best response”) strategies can be compactly represented by the set {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, such that for any disclosed value x they bid {a mathematical formula}B(t,x)=Vt(x), and when no value is disclosed they bid {a mathematical formula}B(t,∅) according to (2) where {a mathematical formula}Pr⁎(X=x) is calculated according to (3).</a>
