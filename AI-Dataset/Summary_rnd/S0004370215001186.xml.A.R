<a href="#0" id="0">The models are not really suitable for the description of highly dynamic groups or communities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For {a mathematical formula}d=1, the resulting network is a forest: a network composed of disjoint tree graphs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, each kind of social relation can possess distinctive characteristics that include: rich information such as degree of connectivity, centrality, trust, interactions frequency, asymmetry, and so on.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Villatoro [39] found that some complex network models lead consensus games to form metastable sub-conventions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consensus games such as this one can be used to reduce the search space in problems where agents need to cooperate or coordinate in a decentralised fashion.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Fig. 14 shows the average number of encounters during 100 independent simulation runs for scale-free networks.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also explore how the new dynamics introduced by the context switching mechanism affects the consensus building process.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For a detailed analysis over some opinion dynamics models, refer to [15].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">One major difference from the previous model is that the agents no longer interact with a neighbour from any network at any time.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We study the notion of context permeability in different simulation models in which agents interact using a simple consensus game.</a>
