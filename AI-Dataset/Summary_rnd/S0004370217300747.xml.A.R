<a href="#0" id="0">These improvements often complement each other, for example Frisch, Jefferson, and Miguel [23] show how breaking symmetries can lead to effective implied constraints for BIBDs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If we consider some transformation t (for example, multiplying by two then restoring the normal form), an Active AC-CS e is a subexpression that is contained in one set of AC expressions as-is, and the transformed version {a mathematical formula}t(e) is contained in another set of AC expressions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The geometric mean speed-up with the SAT solver is 0.983 with confidence interval [0.964, 0.999].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}rings[a,b] indicates whether ring a is connected to node b. For each ring a we have the sum constraint {a mathematical formula}∑b=1nrings[a,b]≤r.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">I-CSE-NC has not, but it has missed a potentially useful AC-CS and has not linked {a mathematical formula}v+w+y+z to the other two sums.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The Active AC-CSE algorithm (named Active X-CSE) is an extension of Algorithm 1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, {a mathematical formula}m[1,1] is replaced by 0 throughout.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The trend is particularly clear for BIBD, Langford and OPD problem classes.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The model has a v by b matrix m of Boolean variables.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Each iteration of the loop is as follows.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">X-CSE is able to extract a particular AC-CS from the same product more than once on this problem.</a>
