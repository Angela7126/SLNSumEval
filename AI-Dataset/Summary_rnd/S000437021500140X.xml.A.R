<a href="#0" id="0">The goal here is to compute a policy {a mathematical formula}π(b(S)):Δ(S)→A that maps distributions over S into actions, where {a mathematical formula}b(S) is the current belief state as given by Equation (12).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Table C.3 shows examples of behaviours for different levels of deflection.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Conclusions and future work</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{sup:5} For example, a tutoring system may “command” a student to do something ({a mathematical formula}Ba={−0.1,1.3,1.6}), or may “suggest” instead ({a mathematical formula}Ba={1.8,1.4,0.8}), which is considerably more “good” than the command.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To do this, we propose to leverage research in sociology on Affect Control Theory (ACT) [1].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Many contemporary philosophers and poststructuralist sociologists and have challenged the notion of a unified, stable, and authentic self, instead arguing that our interpretations of human experience are constantly changing [64].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also plan to investigate usages of the model for collaborative agents in more complex domains, for competitive, manipulative or therapeutic agents, conversational agents, social networks, and for social simulations where we have more than two agents acting.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}Pr(x′|x,f′,τ′,a) denotes how the application progresses given the previous state, the fundamental and transient sentiments, and the (propositional) action of the agent.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is the only prompt necessary, the deflection stays low, the agent gets a reasonable estimate of the client identity ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[2.8,−0.13,−1.36], a distance of 1.0).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">BayesAct is modelling the case where the environment contains humans (or other BayesAct agents) who are partially responsible for the state dynamics.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Finally, the reward function is defined over state-action pairs and rewards those states and actions that are beneficial overall to the goals of the system-human interaction.</a>
