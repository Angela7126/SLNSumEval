<a href="#2" id="2">All complex atoms A are assumed to be decidable, i.e., for any Herbrand interpretation I, checking whether I satisfies A is feasible in finite time.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">For logic programs whose rule heads are atoms, in [16], [53] a three-valued fixpoint semantics was introduced, which defines answer sets (called two-valued stable models) that are free of circular justifications.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">All FLP answer sets of this program are also well-justified FLP answer sets, thus the picture does not change if we measure the average runtime per answer set.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This definition has been motivated by giving an answer set semantics to logic programs with aggregates, and due to its simplicity and attractive properties (minimality of models is guaranteed), it can be easily deployed to other extensions of logic programs, provided that rule satisfaction is properly defined.</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">Clearly, a well-supported interpretation I induces a level mapping via the partial order ≺, i.e., for any {a mathematical formula}A∈I, there is a rule {a mathematical formula}A←body(r) in {a mathematical formula}ground(Π) such that I satisfies {a mathematical formula}body(r) and for every positive literal B in {a mathematical formula}body(r), B is at a lower level than A.</a>
