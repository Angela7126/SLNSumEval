<a href="#0" id="0">In the following, we describe two possible shapes of strategies, namely linear and piecewise-linear.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The termination of the algorithm requires that this function eventually returns the entire {a mathematical formula}Y→u that exits the repeat loop fulfilling the condition at line 9.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We use the standard semantic notion of interpretation and satisfiability [24].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From the practical point of view, each disjunct is either an atom of the original formula or its negation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We can rephrase the concept of weak controllability presented in Definition 4 as a satisfiability problem modulo the {a mathematical formula}LRA theory as follows.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The Boolean abstraction has the same Boolean structure of the first-order formula, but “replaces” the predicates which contain T information with fresh Boolean variables.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If such a hyperplane exists, then it is a valid linear strategy for the entire problem.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The process is iterated until a strategy is found or the entire set of durations is marked as “usable”.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the rest of this paper, we focus on weak controllability, addressing the decision problem (i.e. determining whether there exists a winning strategy), and the synthesis problem (i.e. extracting such a strategy in an executable form).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, in the experimental evaluation, we do not compare with any other tool or approach.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The system admits no solution in the real numbers.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As such, they can be encoded as weak controllability problems.</a>
