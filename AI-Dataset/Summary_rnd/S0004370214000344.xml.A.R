<a href="#0" id="0">Since {a mathematical formula}[(H,I),J]∈C⊚⊚σ↓[(F,G),D], by Definition 18, {a mathematical formula}[(H,I),J]∈C⊛σ↓[(F,G),D].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In other words, we need to eliminate a set of credibility objects from {a mathematical formula}CB so that no path is left from {a mathematical formula}A1 to {a mathematical formula}A4 in the new credibility base.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider {a mathematical formula}C={[(D,B),A],[(B,E),H],[(D,E),F],[(A,H),E],[(A,G),B]}, and the input {a mathematical formula}[(E,D),G].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then, there is some path P of {a mathematical formula}C(D−E) such that {a mathematical formula}P⊆C′.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this scenario, each agent could receive information from multiple sources, and the agents' subjective attribution of trust or credibility to a particular informant can be related to the trust attributed to others.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">NPR3 – Conditional success: {a mathematical formula}[(A,B),S]∈C⊚⊚[(A,B),S] when for all objects {a mathematical formula}[(D,E),F] that are not safe with respect to {a mathematical formula}(B,A) in {a mathematical formula}C it holds that {a mathematical formula}(F,S)∈Cl(C).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We will also consider the broadening of the results obtained here to deal with different contexts.</a>
