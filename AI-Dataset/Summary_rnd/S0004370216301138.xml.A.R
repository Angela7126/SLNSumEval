<a href="#0" id="0">For example, in the crafted SAT+UNSAT track of the CSSC 2014, we encountered a case in which the configured solver performed somewhat worse than the default solver: Clasp configured on benchmark family LABS timed out on 93 test instances, whereas its default only timed out on 87 test instances (see also Fig. 5b).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{sup:17} This being the case, it was fortunate that Riss3gExt was ineligible for medals.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The runtime budget we allow to configure each solver has an obvious impact on the results.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Compared to the inaugural CSSC in 2013, we improved the competition design in several ways:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Due to constraints imposed by our computational infrastructure, we used a memory limit of 3GB for each solver run.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Here, we only mention some details that were important for the setup of the CSSC:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our findings thus challenge the traditional approach to solver design that tries to avoid having too many algorithm parameters (since these parameters complicate manual tuning and analysis).</a>
