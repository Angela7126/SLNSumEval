<a href="#0" id="0">Also, note that by adding subplans we also introduce more cases in which plans are equally preferable when using the above query policies.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The transition function {a mathematical formula}Tr(si+1,p,si) is the probability that the set of hypotheses corresponding to the state {a mathematical formula}si+1 is obtained after updating the hypothesis set with respect to the answer to query p, given that the previous set of hypotheses corresponds to the set {a mathematical formula}si.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Lastly, we assume that a complete PR algorithm is available.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A straightforward approach to identify the correct hypothesis is to ask the observed agent to reveal it, but soliciting complete plans is time and effort consuming and prone to error.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To illustrate the difference between the strategies above, consider Fig. 2, which contains four candidate hypotheses {a mathematical formula}H1,…,H4.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In particular, each observation of a student's action in the software can be part of a given solution strategy, but it can also possibly be part of a failed attempt or a mistake.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It shows that the earlier we use the probing process, the fewer hypotheses we have to reason about in the future.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This option requires to construct another leftmost tree deriving {a mathematical formula}σ1 with a root that matches one of the open frontier nodes of an existing plan.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We chose a simple protocol between the recognizer and observed agent (a query and a yes/no response).</a>
