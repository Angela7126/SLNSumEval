<a href="#1" id="1">Accordingly, we evaluate {a mathematical formula}M,S,8⊩⊞3(3)◇x and the substream returned by {a mathematical formula}τ3(3) has timeline {a mathematical formula}[3,6].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let us call such partitions meager.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The recent Apache Flink framework [32] distinguishes three notions of time: the event time refers to the creation of the signal at its producer, the ingestion time is the timestamp that Flink creates when it receives the signal, and the processing time is the local time at an internal operator when the signal is actually processed.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In [15] non-ground plain LARS with sliding windows was then considered with the aim of providing highly efficient model update.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Alternatively, we can use the set A of atoms with predicate tram, where we obtain the stream {a mathematical formula}D1 above, shown in Fig. 10, by {a mathematical formula}fA(D,t) (for any {a mathematical formula}t∈N).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For LARS formulas α (respectively LARS programs P), problem MC is in{a mathematical formula}P(respectively{a mathematical formula}co-NP-complete), if only time-based, tuple-based, meager partition-based, and filter windows occur in α (respectively in P).</a>

<a href="#8" id="8">Relation-to-stream (R2S) translates back a relation into a stream for the output of continuous queries.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We have shown that propositional LARS formulas with sliding time windows can be expressed in linear temporal logic, and thus amount to a (strict) fragment of the regular languages, while LARS program with such windows capture the regular languages.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Minimality of answer streamsLet P be a LARS program, D be a data stream, t be a time point and{a mathematical formula}I∈AS(P,D,t).</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">If {a mathematical formula}wnd(α) is bounded by a constant, then this number is polynomial in the size of S and α. We can thus use a labeling technique to evaluate formulas bottom up (from subformulas) over the possible substreams in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">While conceptually simple, this implementation is not geared towards performance and specifically lacks incremental reasoning techniques.</a>
