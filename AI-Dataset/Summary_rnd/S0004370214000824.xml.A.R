<a href="#0" id="0">Given a regular tree grammar {a mathematical formula}G=(S,N,F,R), the derivation relation {a mathematical formula}→G associated to G is a relation on terms from {a mathematical formula}T(F∪N) such that {a mathematical formula}s→Gt if and only if there is a rule {a mathematical formula}N→α∈R and there is a context C such that {a mathematical formula}s=C[N/X] and {a mathematical formula}t=C[α/X], where X is a variable from {a mathematical formula}X. The subset of {a mathematical formula}T(F∪N) which can be generated by successive derivations starting with the start symbol is denoted by {a mathematical formula}Lu(G)={s∈T(F∪N)|S→G+s} where {a mathematical formula}→G+ is the transitive closure of {a mathematical formula}→G.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">They investigate a broad range of query languages (languages in which the relevant consequences are expressed), starting with the language allowing for expressing inconsistency only and ending with Second Order Logic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For instance, if we have derived the sequent {a mathematical formula}C⊑D, we can derive the sequent {a mathematical formula}∃r.C⊑∃r.D using rule (Ex).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, we have found a model of {a mathematical formula}Tn witnessing {a mathematical formula}Tn⊭E⊑B, contradicting our assumption that {a mathematical formula}T′⊨E⊑B.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assume role depth is 0.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">From this result, the grammars are constructed in linear time.</a>
