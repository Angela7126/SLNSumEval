<a href="#1" id="1">In the following we assume that {a mathematical formula}ε>0 is chosen small enough such that {a mathematical formula}cijε∈i(Ai).If {a mathematical formula}Θ⊨aiDCaj, we replace {a mathematical formula}Ai by {a mathematical formula}Ai∩Hij≥ε; the region {a mathematical formula}Aj can be similarly replaced by a smaller region, but it is sufficient that one of {a mathematical formula}Ai, {a mathematical formula}Aj is modified.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For all leaf nodes a and b such that{a mathematical formula}Θ⊨aECb, it holds that{a mathematical formula}qab∈Ya∩Yb.Let {a mathematical formula}a′ be the sibling of a in the tree.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A convex polytope V in {a mathematical formula}Rn is the intersection of a finite set of half-spaces, i.e.{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}hi∈Rn is a vector and {a mathematical formula}ci∈R is a constant.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over{a mathematical formula}{DC,NTPP,NTPP−1}has a convex solution in{a mathematical formula}R.For an atomic network over {a mathematical formula}{DC,NTPP,NTPP−1} we can partition the set of variables V as follows:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Indeed, if {a mathematical formula}Θ⊭vPar and {a mathematical formula}Θ⊭vPbs, it holds that {a mathematical formula}v−<0<v+.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let Θ be any consistent RCC8 network over {a mathematical formula}{PP,EC} and let V be the set of variables occurring in Θ. We construct the RCC8 network Ψ by adding to Θ the following constraints:</a>
