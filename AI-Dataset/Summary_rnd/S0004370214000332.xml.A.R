<a href="#0" id="0">We conclude that the direct encoding does not allow for strong propagation and lower bounds.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Fig. 3-left shows the histogram of a typical binary cost function for one of the CPD instances (1ENH, one of the open instances).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Mini-bucket lower bounds require space and time in {a mathematical formula}O(di) (where i is a user controlled parameter).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Local consistency is enforced using Equivalence Preserving Transformations (EPTs) that move costs between different cost functions [79], [54], [57], [18], [55], [15], [17], [16], [14].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Each term in the energy can be computed for each amino acid/rotamer (or pair for {a mathematical formula}E(ir,js)) independently.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">0/1 quadratic programming model</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We have shown how DEE can be integrated with local consistency with a reasonable time complexity.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, a variable i violating the NC property because all its values {a mathematical formula}ir have a non-zero {a mathematical formula}E(ir) cost, can be made NC by subtracting the minimum cost from all {a mathematical formula}E(ir) and adding this cost to {a mathematical formula}E∅.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We decided to include daoopt as the winning solver of the 2011 PASCAL probabilistic inference challenge in the “MAP” category.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The rigid backbone discrete rotamer Computational Protein Design problem is therefore defined by a fixed backbone with a corresponding set of positions (residues), a rotamer library and a set of energy functions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">An optimal solution must therefore contain exactly one value per domain.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">(4).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Given this observation, we also experimented with running maxhs with the core minimization option turned off, on the set of 12 instances which update those in [2], using the tuple encoding.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">When the DEE algorithm does not significantly reduce the search space, the {a mathematical formula}A⁎ search tree can be too slow or memory demanding and the problem cannot be solved.</a>
