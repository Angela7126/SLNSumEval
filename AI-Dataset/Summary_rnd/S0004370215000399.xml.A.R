<a href="#0" id="0">The alignment process can be seen as a function Φ where given a pair of ontologies O and {a mathematical formula}O′, a partial (and optional) input alignment A, a set of parameters p, a set of resources r, returns a new alignment {a mathematical formula}A′:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For each pair of the selected individuals (called parents), the crossover operator generates two children, which are obtained by mixing the genes of the parents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, the match ratio can be defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since the problem scale in our work is not large (only four parameters need to be determined), we set the size of population, maximum number of iterations and the fitness evaluation number for termination as 30, 20 and 250 respectively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Although GOAL does not directly compute the alignment between two ontologies, it determines, through a GA, the optimal weight configuration for a weighted average aggregation of several similarity measures by considering a reference alignment.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To overcome the shortcoming of MatchMeasure, we employ the UIR which is a measure that allows to compare two individuals using MatchCoverage and Frequency without dependency on the relative weight α in MatchFmeasure.</a>
