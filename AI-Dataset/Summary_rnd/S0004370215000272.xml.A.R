<a href="#0" id="0">Clearly the only 1-structure for A where {a mathematical formula}OA(TRUE) is the set of all possible worlds, that is, let {a mathematical formula}eA1={(w,{})|w∈W}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Axioms:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Next, we establish a relationship to [12], before turning to a multiagent version of AEL.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">Multiagent logics of knowledge have also received considerable attention [18].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">That is, in contrast to classical epistemic logic where multiagent extensions are immediate [1], generalizing only knowing has been shown to be very challenging [12].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By assumption {a mathematical formula}(w″,e⁎)∉eAk.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In terms of our proof-theoretic investigations of only knowing in the propositional case, we followed the approaches of [4], [12], [34] by considering Hilbert-style axiom systems.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For all formulas α of A-depth of k and B-depth j:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}⋀S(α∧βz)∧⋀S(γ∧δz′)∧V(α∨γ)⊃ V4.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In sum, despite the many attempts, it has remained an open question whether there is a natural semantics for only knowing in the multiagent setting for a first-order language.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To illustrate the idea briefly, let us write {a mathematical formula}Eα to syntactically mean {a mathematical formula}KAα∧KBα.</a>
