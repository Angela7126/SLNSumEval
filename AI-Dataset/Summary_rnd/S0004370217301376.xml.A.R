<a href="#0" id="0">But we now can use the semantics of speculative knowledge.In order to prove that {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′)⊨KiSφ, we assume that {a mathematical formula}t′∈Ri′(s′) and that {a mathematical formula}R′:(M′,t′)↔_Ai′(s′)(M″,t″), and we have to show that {a mathematical formula}(M″,t″)⊨φ.From {a mathematical formula}R:(M,s)↔_Ai(s)(M′,s′), {a mathematical formula}t′∈Ri′(s′), {a mathematical formula}Ai(s)=Ai′(s′), and back follows that there is a {a mathematical formula}t∈Ri(s) such that {a mathematical formula}(t,t′)∈R[Ai(s)].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Other relations between the non-propositional primitives are discussed in Section 5 on expressivity, e.g., we have that {a mathematical formula}Aiφ↔KiE(φ∨¬φ).</a>
