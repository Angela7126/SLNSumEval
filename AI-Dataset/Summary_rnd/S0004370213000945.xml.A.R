<a href="#1" id="1">This means that if {a mathematical formula}1−w1=0 the individual support for θ from the second piece of evidence {a mathematical formula}e2 will not be counted at all, however reliable {a mathematical formula}e2 may be.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From Theorem 3, there will be {a mathematical formula}pB=0 for any {a mathematical formula}B≠θ.We now first need to prove that {a mathematical formula}mˆθ,e(L)>0 as generated from Eq.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While this may be acceptable in special cases, general situations are that multiple pieces of evidence are of a compensatory nature and each play limited roles or have various degrees of reliabilities in support for and opposition against propositions [41], [28].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Suppose{a mathematical formula}e(i)denotes the combination of the first i pieces of evidence and{a mathematical formula}mθ,e(i)is the probability mass to which θ is supported jointly by{a mathematical formula}e(i), with{a mathematical formula}mθ,e(1)=mθ,1and{a mathematical formula}mP(Θ),e(1)=mP(Θ),1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">(19c), there are two square bracket terms.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A numerical study is conducted to compare the ER rule with other ECRs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From Eq.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">(10) with α replaced by {a mathematical formula}ri) is performed as shown in rows 5–7 of Table 4 headed by {a mathematical formula}mw1,r1(θ), {a mathematical formula}mw2,r2(θ) and {a mathematical formula}mw3,r3(θ).</a>
