<a href="#2" id="2">(10) is then performing the selection of the corresponding vertices v and {a mathematical formula}v′ in the two pairs of neighborhood that are being compared.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The output y consists of all ground atoms of r and all ground atoms of any intensional relation {a mathematical formula}r′ which depends on r. The partition is inferred by analyzing the dependency graphs of Prolog predicates defining intensional relations, using an algorithm reminiscent of the call graph computation in ViPReSS [19].</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">The goal of supervised learning in this setting is to construct a prediction function f that maps the set of input atoms x (a partial interpretation) into a set of output atoms {a mathematical formula}f(x).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Two labeled graphs are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism that preserves also the label information, i.e. {a mathematical formula}ℓ(ϕ(v))=ℓ(v).</a>
