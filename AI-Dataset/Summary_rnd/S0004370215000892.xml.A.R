<a href="#0" id="0">Our class of social choice functions is very limited: let {a mathematical formula}Fappn,m={fk:1≤k≤m−1} be the class of k-approval functions with n agents and m alternatives.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Clearly, this definition is equivalent to the standard one for scoring rules (by adjusting the score vector entries appropriately).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">possible rankings of A in the preference profile (i.e., without regard for which agent holds what preference).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Other papers also assume cardinal utilities and deal with truthfulness and social welfare maximization but in settings without money.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Both cases imply that the sign patterns of L corresponding to {a mathematical formula}s→b1 and {a mathematical formula}s→b0 are different.Hence, we have obtained a lower bound of {a mathematical formula}2d on the number of different sign patterns of L. By applying Lemma 5.8 (with {a mathematical formula}K≤dm2/4, {a mathematical formula}τ=1, and {a mathematical formula}ℓ=m), we obtain an upper bound of {a mathematical formula}(2edm)m on the number of different sign patterns for L. Hence, {a mathematical formula}2d≤(2edm)m and, equivalently, {a mathematical formula}2d/dm≤(2em)m.For the sake of contradiction, assume that {a mathematical formula}d≥6mlog2⁡m and observe that {a mathematical formula}2d/dm increases with d in this range.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We first derive upper and lower bounds on the least distortion that one can hope for, focusing on randomized social choice functions.</a>
