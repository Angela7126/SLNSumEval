<a href="#1" id="1">At that iteration, let L be the local search space of the algorithms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While moving through the environment, we model the discovery of new obstacles by increasing the cost of some arcs in the graph.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The remainder of the article is organized as follows.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">That means that there is no path {a mathematical formula}π′, shorter than π, such that the vertices of {a mathematical formula}π′ are a subset of π and thus if we want to find a better path, we need to look other vertices outside π. Note that every shortest path between s and t is a locally shortest path, but the reverse statement is not necessarily true.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hernández and Baier [14] show a similar effect on the performance of depression-avoiding Real-Time Search algorithms, and analyze in more detail how narrow corridors may become blocked during search.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Incorporating weights in real-time search algorithms à la Weighted A* leads to increased solution cost and consequently to increased runtime.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since costs may only increase, {a mathematical formula}c≤c′.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Real-time search algorithms</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The following lemma proves that if the sequence of nodes expanded by A* is a straight path in a graph that satisfies the triangle inequality then the f-value of a node in the Open list cannot decrease.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Weighted update, the technique that was just shown in the previous section as yielding best results when incorporated into LSS-LRTA*, is applicable to any algorithm that updates the h-values using the equation:{a mathematical formula} where L is a set of states.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">(1); Algorithm 1) is such that the resulting h-value of s is the maximum possible value that still preserves consistency [7].</a>
