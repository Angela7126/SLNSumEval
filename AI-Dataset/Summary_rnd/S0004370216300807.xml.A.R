<a href="#0" id="0">Our challenge is to go beyond human-readable maps and enable map interpretation also by machines.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The same applies to edges in {a mathematical formula}M2.Then either: i) the edge {a mathematical formula}x→y is in {a mathematical formula}M1 or {a mathematical formula}M2, and thus belongs to the good map over {a mathematical formula}M1 or {a mathematical formula}M2 or ii) the path {a mathematical formula}x↠VM1∩VM2y in Γ can be represented as a sequence of 1's (nodes in {a mathematical formula}M1), 2's (nodes in {a mathematical formula}M2) and 0's (nodes neither in {a mathematical formula}M1 nor {a mathematical formula}M2).</a>
