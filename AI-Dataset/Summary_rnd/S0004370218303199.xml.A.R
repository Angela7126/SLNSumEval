<a href="#0" id="0">Moreover, the online algorithm is shown to be on average at least 90% of the optimal.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this section, we present Algorithm 5 which uses battery charge instead of battery swap.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given the average scalability of the optimal solution, we develop an incremental-MIP and a greedy heuristic algorithm which are shown to generate near-optimal solutions with considerably lower execution times.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">MoD can reduce congestion as it reduces the demand for parking spots (such parked cars create some congestion).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper we mainly study this offline setting and then we propose a preliminary solution to an online setting based on our insights from the offline one.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given that the number of tasks to be completed remains fixed, one could expect that by increasing the number of EVs, the number of completed tasks would also increase.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, doing so can create other problems.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As far as the project scheduling problem is concerned, for an EV to execute a task, it must be in the right location, the right time and it must have enough range in the battery.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In more detail, after the set containing all completed tasks is initialized to the empty one (line 1), the optimal algorithm is called for each EV{sup:12} (lines 2–9): Every time the schedule for one EV is calculated (line 6), the sets for the completed tasks and the remaining tasks are updated accordingly (lines 7, 8).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We will refer to this algorithm as Off-Greedy-Swap.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">According to [37], the majority of the existing works consider three main problem categories: 1) Energy efficient EV routing and range maximization, where algorithms and mechanisms have been developed to route EVs in order to minimize energy loss and maximize energy harvested{sup:5} during a trip (e.g., [41], [47] and [48]).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The completion constraints ensure the proper execution of tasks.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We created a set of tasks, that could be executed by a single EV (i.e., the end location of one task was the start location of the next one).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Therefore, the average case complexity of Algorithm 4 is {a mathematical formula}O(|Δ|×|L|×|A|+|T|×|L|2×log|L||L|2×|T|).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Then, the schedule of the fixed tasks that leads to a higher expected utility (number of tasks expected to be executed) is selected.</a>
