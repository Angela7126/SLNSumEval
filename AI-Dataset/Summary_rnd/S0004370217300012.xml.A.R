<a href="#0" id="0">We define the models of {a mathematical formula}RAL as in [2].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That is, the executability of the action indicates a flawed simulation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By lines 12–13, for all leaves {a mathematical formula}n′ of {a mathematical formula}T1, we have that there exists {a mathematical formula}n″∈p(n′) such that {a mathematical formula}eA(n″)≤eA(n′).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, we consider the first configuration {a mathematical formula}i=1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Clearly, this is an undesirable action tuple, as it does not correspond to any transition of the automaton.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The new fragment, which we call {a mathematical formula}pprRAL, allows us to express statements about the existence of nested strategies for a coalition of agents given some initial allocation of resources.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, we consider the proponent-restricted fragment.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">With the above observation we can conclude that also {a mathematical formula}ηi(3−x,Rr)=0.</a>
