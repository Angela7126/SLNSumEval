<a href="#0" id="0">However, under the circumstances of noisy fitness landscapes, there is a need to address the uncertainty related to the fitness measurements while determining the hypervolume of the approximate Pareto front A. The uncertainty problem is resolved here by weighting the size of the objective space covered by a nondominated solution {a mathematical formula}X→ with the probability that {a mathematical formula}X→ dominates at least one population member.</a>
