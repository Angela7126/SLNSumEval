<a href="#0" id="0">Each player has a payoff matrix based on each other's strategies.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Fig. 10(a) shows the solution quality of the proposed algorithms and the baselines in defense against destructive control.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Exact solution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Formally, let {a mathematical formula}s=〈si:i∈{1,⋯,n}〉 denote a pure strategy of the defender, where {a mathematical formula}si∈{0,1} indicates whether a voter group i is protected.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Now, if we fix {a mathematical formula}c∈C, it is easy to check whether there exists a c-dominant-strategy: we can protect the m groups in which c is most favored over υ, and check whether the attacker can have υ beat c by deleting k of the unprotected groups which favor c more than υ. Similar as previous definition of {a mathematical formula}tc−ω, let {a mathematical formula}tc−υ=〈tic−υ:i∈I〉 be a vector with {a mathematical formula}tic−υ=tic−tiυ, that is, the vote advantage of c over υ in group {a mathematical formula}i∈I.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In both cases, we take 60 attacker types (drawn from this distribution) to be the ground truth.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the case of destructive control, the attacker's goal is to prevent ω from winning.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Algorithm 4 presents the full heuristic procedure.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Optimal defense against election control</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, their focus is on manipulation, rather than control, and on designing rules which are NP-hard to manipulate, rather than using limited resources to reduce the likelihood of successful subversion of an election.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Surprisingly, we now show that the destructive variant of group-level control can still be computed in polynomial time, significantly generalizing the previous result of Hemaspaandra et al. [27].</a>
