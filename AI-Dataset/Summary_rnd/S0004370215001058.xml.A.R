<a href="#0" id="0">These results are also applicable to multi-stage problems, provided that a rolling horizon approach is adopted and that the aim is to characterise the probability that stage one decisions of a sampled SCSPs {a mathematical formula}PˆN over N scenarios are consistent with respect to the original SCSP {a mathematical formula}P.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An interesting property of confidence intervals related to the estimation of the “success” probability associated with a Bernoulli trial consists in the fact that, given a confidence probability, it is possible to derive mathematically, by performing a worst case analysis, the minimum number of samples that should be observed in order to produce a confidence interval of a given size.</a>
