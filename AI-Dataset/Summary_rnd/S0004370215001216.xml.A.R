<a href="#0" id="0">But unlike Extended-Powell, this one has a single solution.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For instance, Fig. 4d (page 110) shows {a mathematical formula}RC3([0,1]3), which is significantly different from {a mathematical formula}Fcˆ(C3) shown in Fig. 6d.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since {a mathematical formula}volH=0, {a mathematical formula}vol(LΣ(x)∩H)=0 and we obtain {a mathematical formula}volRΣ(x)≤volLΣ(x).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Specific PSBCs for NCSPs</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We can define the symmetry class of any point {a mathematical formula}x∈x as the set of the images {a mathematical formula}s(x) for all the symmetries s of the problem.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The coefficients in {a mathematical formula}cˆ induce a numerical instability in floating-point computations since adding {a mathematical formula}2n−1xn−1 and {a mathematical formula}x0 can yield cancellation when n is large, leading to inaccurate comparisons.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If {a mathematical formula}xσ1=xσ2 then, since the two symmetries are different, we have {a mathematical formula}|xΣ|<|Σ| and we have arrived to a contradiction.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We identify such symmetries with their associated permutations and denote both by σ in the following.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is in particular the case for problems Brown, Cyclohexane, Extended-Powell, Noon, Sparse and Wright, i.e., problems with very different minimal and maximal sets (typically n and {a mathematical formula}n2 inequalities, respectively) and for which the gain with maximal PSBCs over that with minimal PSBCs vary between {a mathematical formula}0% and {a mathematical formula}8%, sometimes in favor of the maximal set, sometimes in favor of the minimal set.</a>
