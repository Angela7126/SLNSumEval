<a href="#0" id="0">Nearly positive graphsLet {a mathematical formula}Eω− be the set of edges in E with negative weights.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We perform this step until there are k coalitions and we are done.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the other direction, assume that there exists a coalition structure P that is a member of the 3-coalitions-core.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, it would be interesting to consider additional task related aspects.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We then partition the nodes of G into {a mathematical formula}r+k−1 connected component, where the r connected components that do not contain the agents {a mathematical formula}x1,x2,..,xi−1,xi+1,..,xk are denoted by {a mathematical formula}CC1,...,CCr.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As an aside, note that the model described above can be understood as a special case of symmetric additively separable hedonic games[10].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The number of coalitions, k, was set to 3 or 4.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Related work</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Therefore, the graph is nearly positive.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let {a mathematical formula}(Gc,s) be an instance of Clique, where {a mathematical formula}Gc=(Vc,Ec) and {a mathematical formula}|Vc|=nc.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In contrast, Y contains replicas of agents for each subset of elements {a mathematical formula}di.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In each iteration the heuristic examines the two new coalitions that were created in the previous iteration (line 6), and their indexes are {a mathematical formula}partitioned and {a mathematical formula}k′.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Therefore, for every {a mathematical formula}1≤h≤r the utilities of all the agents in {a mathematical formula}CCh∩C′ are no lower than their utilities in {a mathematical formula}C′.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Intermediate cost: {a mathematical formula}0<α<2.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This will be the subject of discussion later on in this section.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Since finding a member of the k-coalitions-core is proven to be a hard problem, and {a mathematical formula}Gapmin is shown to be unbounded, we provide a heuristic for finding a member of the k-coalitions-core that also guarantees a social welfare within a factor of 1/2 of the optimal social welfare.</a>
