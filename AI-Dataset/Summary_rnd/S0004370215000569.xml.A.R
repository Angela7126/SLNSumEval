<a href="#0" id="0">In this sense, we call Γ a network of constraints, and denote by for example {a mathematical formula}Rij the constraint that relates {a mathematical formula}vi to {a mathematical formula}vj.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These are the five basic relations, and the following 7 relations (cf.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Write {a mathematical formula}(xTy) for the constraint between x and y in {a mathematical formula}Γp′, the a-closure of {a mathematical formula}Γ′.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For RCC8, we identify two maximal distributive subalgebras which are not contained in any other distributive subalgebras, one contains 41 relations and the other contains 64.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Several features are worth noting in Fig. 11:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is because, otherwise, we have {a mathematical formula}αd∈W∩O8⋄R∩R⋄O8 and hence by (A.1){a mathematical formula}αd∈R∩W⊆R.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that {a mathematical formula}(xCT(π)y) is entailed by those constraints in π.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By the above property, we have {a mathematical formula}EQ∈T−1⋄R and {a mathematical formula}EQ∈T−1⋄S.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We have a cubic time algorithm (Algorithm 1) for computing {a mathematical formula}Γc.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The redundancy problem (i.e., the problem of determining if a constraint is redundant in a network) is related to the minimal label problem (cf.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">[38], [8], [20], [36], [3]).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This implies that W is contained in R. The case for {a mathematical formula}R={TPP−1,EQ} is similar.In summary, we have {a mathematical formula}R⊇W in all cases.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In stark contrast the Tasmanian statistical areas are highly structured, made up of four levels of spatially contiguous and nested but non-overlapping regions.</a>
