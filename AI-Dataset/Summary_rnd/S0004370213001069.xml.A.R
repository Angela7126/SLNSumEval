<a href="#1" id="1">We will also apply the same idea for semi-stable and stage semantics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence we consider only mcf sets as candidates for stage extensions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the opposite direction, one could consider further fragments of Dung-style frameworks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Otherwise (line 16) we learn that we are not interested in extensions with range S. Finally, if all sets have been excluded from being the range of an extension satisfying q, the procedures rejects.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Conclusion</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Table 3 summarizes our results which are all negative in the sense that full second-level complexity is reached when fragments are parameterized in a “syntactic” way; only {a mathematical formula}acyc yields some positive results (due to [8]).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As before we have that {a mathematical formula}E∈cf(F) and {a mathematical formula}ER+=S.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">Such approaches fall under the general counter-example guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) approach originating from the field of model checking [12], [13].</a>
