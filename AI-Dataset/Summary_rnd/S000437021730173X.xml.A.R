<a href="#0" id="0">In our Scaling example, the histories for move{a mathematical formula}(l1,l2) are exactly the subsets of loaded objects.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, this is so for the three heuristic functions {a mathematical formula}hmax, {a mathematical formula}hLM-cut, and {a mathematical formula}hFF considered here.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For arbitrary leaf paths, we have that {a mathematical formula}cost(π)≥AugCost(πF), and hence that {a mathematical formula}h⁎(sL$)≥hF⁎(s) as desired.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider the Vanilla example (an object o and two trucks {a mathematical formula}tA,tB moving along a line of three locations {a mathematical formula}l1,l2,l3), and consider the fork factoring given by {a mathematical formula}FC={tA,tB} and {a mathematical formula}FL={{o}}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We decompose planning tasks into components identified by disjoint sets of state variables.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Star-topology decoupling eliminates both of these complexity sources by restricting the form of global interactions allowed.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The X strategy subsumes the F and IF ones in terms of the number of factorizable instances (this is not necessarily so as there could be cases with a single {a mathematical formula}IGΠ(FΠSCC) leaf SCC and several root SCCs all of which have an arc to the leaf).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Recall here that the center actions {a mathematical formula}AC are not disjoint from the leaf actions {a mathematical formula}AL[FL].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For each clause {a mathematical formula}Cj there is a center action {a mathematical formula}ajC which is applicable to the initial state, and which allows to generate a hypercube corresponding to the truth-value assignments disallowed by {a mathematical formula}cj.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We introduce the method in AI planning, where a planning task is given in terms of finite-domain state variables, an initial state, a goal condition, and a set of actions describing the possible transitions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">That wealth of factorings is, however, of unclear practical value, as they have only a single leaf.</a>
