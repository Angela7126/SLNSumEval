<a href="#0" id="0">But this is not always available, e.g. tag data extracted from some loosely structured meta-data source can only provide a rough hierarchy with potentially inaccurate relations, as the meta-data associated with videos in the TRECVID dataset.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For any random forest model, we repeated 10 folds and reported the average results.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Below we review several most related random forest variants.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Formally, we aim to predict the existence probability {a mathematical formula}p(x⁎,j) of a missing tag {a mathematical formula}j∈Z in a sample {a mathematical formula}x⁎.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Overall, our methods HML-RF(AM) outperforms all other baselines, including the state-of-the-art models LSR and TCMR, and contemporary deep-based multi-modal correlation learning methods DCCA and DCCAE.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our HML-RF can be considered as an extended hybrid model of classification and clustering forests.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This further indicates the positive restricting effect of global data structures over inferring local instance-level semantic concept structures.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">(10) Latent Maximum Margin Clustering (L-MMC) [3]: An extended MMC model that allows to accommodate latent variables, e.g. tag labels, during maximum cluster margin learning.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We randomly sampled 30 clusters, each of which contains over 500 images and a total of 17523 images were selected for the evaluation of both global image clustering and local tag concept completion.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Unlike the above supervised settings, we investigate both correlations in a structurally-constrained learning manner.</a>
