<a href="#3" id="3">Relational linear programs (RLPs), which we will introduce now, feature exactly this.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, we read off the characteristic matrix as per (4) (line 2).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">There are three cases.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If we recompute the c and b vector accordingly, our lifted LP becomes{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} having replaced {a mathematical formula}x+y by the supervariable {a mathematical formula}x.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our approach subsumes this method, as we replace the orbits with a coarser equivalence relation which, in contrast to the orbits, is computable in quasilinear time.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To illustrate AMPL, Fig. 2 shows the flow problems formulated in AMPL.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It is now easy to see that the marginalization constraints are logically parametrized as well.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Logically parameterized LP variables, par-vars for short, are values to be determined by the solver, and we follow AMPL's notation in lines 1–2:{a mathematical formula} The rest of the program specifies the objective (line 4) and the constraints (lines 5–17) of the flow problem.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The gridworld problem consists of an agent navigating within a grid of {a mathematical formula}n×n states.</a>
