<a href="#4" id="4">A polynomially DAG-filterable global cost function</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">On the largest instances, because of an exponential increase of the number of backtracks, the network-based approach becomes unable to solve all the instances in less than five minutes, but still outperforms the other two approaches.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}W_Grammarvar(S,G)is a polynomially DAG-filterable and thus tractable projection-safe global cost function.We adopt the dynamic programming approach similar to the modified CYK parser [38].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Each internal vertex {a mathematical formula}ωSi in V is associated with an aggregation function {a mathematical formula}fi that maps a multiset of costs {a mathematical formula}{αj|αj∈[0…⊤]} to {a mathematical formula}[0…⊤] and is based on an associative and commutative binary operator;</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">to an existing global constraint.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">When a cost function {a mathematical formula}WS is processed, all the cost functions whose minimum variable is larger than the minimum variable of S have already been processed, which guarantees that none of the established full supports will be broken in the future.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The constraint is satisfied if and only if {a mathematical formula}z=μ(S,A1,…,At).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For a tractable global cost function {a mathematical formula}WS=W_GCF(S,A1,…,At), the time complexity of computing {a mathematical formula}min⁡{WS} is bounded above by a polynomial function in the size of the input, including the scope, the corresponding domains, the other parameters of the global cost function, and {a mathematical formula}log⁡(m).</a>
