<a href="#0" id="0">Arguments are sorted such that they will be placed from the one who attacks the most to the one who attacks the less arguments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For a program π and an input database D, we write {a mathematical formula}π(D) instead of {a mathematical formula}D∪π.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Indeed, labeling-based and extension-based semantics are equivalent [21] through the following transformations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Already computed extensions are excluded from subsequent search steps.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Despite the exception from above, it can be seen that solvers that rely on a reduction to other established formalisms, such as SAT solving, constraint satisfaction problems, or, as mentioned, answer set programming, performed better than solvers implementing a direct algorithm for abstract argumentation.</a>
