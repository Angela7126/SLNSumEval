<a href="#0" id="0">At this point, it may be interesting to discuss what is actually meant by ‘a large number of constraints’.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let F be the forest containing all oriented, finite trees where the indegree of each node is at most one and let {a mathematical formula}DF be the nodes in F. We then define the following four relations on F. Arbitrarily choose {a mathematical formula}x,y∈DF.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that the problem {a mathematical formula}CSP(B∨=) is different in this respect since it can be seen as an alternative formulation of 1-SAT, i.e., SAT restricted to unary clauses.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This reduction can be done in polynomial time since a clause with {a mathematical formula}n′ literals is replaced by a disjunctive constraint with {a mathematical formula}n′2K−1 disjuncts (since K is a constant depending only on c).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We avoid tedious technicalities by ignoring this issue and view constraint languages as multisets.</a>
