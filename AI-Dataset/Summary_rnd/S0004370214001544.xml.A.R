<a href="#0" id="0">Robots should be able to extract information about an object's position, its contacts, and its spatial relations to other objects from its environment in order to reason about a task.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thereby, the robustness of a single parameterized plan can be evaluated on the basis of the set of resulting timelines.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Others describe the context of the scenario.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Properly performed, the mix is poured into the center of the pancake maker (without spilling) where it forms a round shape.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the query above, we used the overlaps relations as the temporal relation between the fluents and the flipping action.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For instance, a robot has to recognize task-related objects and it has to estimate their poses in order to assert and instantiate a new scenario within the framework.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The rate of change depends on the diffusion coefficient and its respective change.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given the principle of inheritance, properties of a concept are derived from their super-concepts.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If the specified event is found in the timeline the predicate evaluates to true.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Based on a logical axiomatization (i.e., a description of a manipulation scenario and a fully instantiated robot plan) a physics-based simulation is parameterized.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Eventually, step (5) evaluates which timelines represent successful trials.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Hence, we believe that the underlying idea and the developed methods of this work can have a broad impact in field of robotics.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Fluents</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">However, for robots these instructions are highly underspecified and therefore they need other means to acquire the relevant knowledge which enables them to perform the task.</a>
