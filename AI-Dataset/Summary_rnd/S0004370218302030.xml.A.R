<a href="#0" id="0">The revenue obtained on assigning a server to the request is marked on the edge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">More details about the multi-stage model is provided in the Section 5.1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">τ: It represents the maximum time within which the taxi should reach the pickup point.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The competitive ratio of MSS and BD in this setting is constantly less than the myopic approaches even after providing multiple samples as shown in Fig. 17.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While this seems to have provided good results in the truck fleet optimization problems, it is not a good approximation in the taxi fleet optimization.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The variable {a mathematical formula}xijt,k,t>1 denotes the number of zone i servers assigned to element j of {a mathematical formula}ξtD,k.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We employ MSS{a mathematical formula}(Δ=x,Q=y) and BD{a mathematical formula}(Δ=x,Q=y) to refer to our approaches when the time interval Δ is set to x and the look ahead duration Q is set to y. We compare different approaches with respect to (i) Revenue earned by taxis; (ii) Number of requests satisfied; and (iii) Run-time to compute the assignment.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If the zone {a mathematical formula}Zi server is assigned to the request having destination in zone {a mathematical formula}Zi then the variable {a mathematical formula}xi is true else if it is assigned to the request having destination in the zone {a mathematical formula}Zi′ then {a mathematical formula}xi is false.</a>
