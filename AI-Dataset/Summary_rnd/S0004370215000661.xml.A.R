<a href="#1" id="1">Another possible outcome for the planner is that no plan is found due to some missing operators.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, the strategy employed for teacher interaction is similar to that proposed in [18].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The first was implemented in a scenario that comprised a {a mathematical formula}3×3 grid world with eight black counters placed in the cells (Fig. 12).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The second refinement involves specializing the precondition of {a mathematical formula}ri using the descriptors of the preconditions of the other POs in {a mathematical formula}Rcomb,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Ri[2] is the set of POs generated from this refinement and {a mathematical formula}pk is the precondition of any other PO {a mathematical formula}rk∈Rcomb.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this manner, we consider that our framework can facilitate the integration of robots into human society, at least by helping us with simple everyday chores.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The action provided by the planner or the teacher was sent to the action module for its actual execution.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This may result in a drastic reduction in the search space size compared with traditional dynamic programming methods.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To make this possible, the iDMF interleaves planning and learning to improve the capability of the planner progressively as more operators are learned, thereby allowing the robot to make immediate use of any improvement in the set of POs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we evaluated the sensitivity of the system to the learning parameters, n and m, which regulate the number of POs generated in parallel, and thus the speed of learning (Section 4.2.2).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A major feature of the proposed method that allows correct POs to be found is our development of an efficient approach that permits the robot to determine unchanged causative conditions as well as the actions that lead to the observed changes.</a>
