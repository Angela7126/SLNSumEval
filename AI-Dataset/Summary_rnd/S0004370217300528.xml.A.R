<a href="#1" id="1">If {a mathematical formula}X′∈F and {a mathematical formula}X″⊂X′, then {a mathematical formula}X″∈F holds,</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">At Step 2, {a mathematical formula}C3 is {a mathematical formula}{(s5,c2),(sd,c3)}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This example also shows that there exists no stable mechanism.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">[2], who considered a setting that resembles ours, modified TTC to a setting where some houses are initially owned by tenants, while others are not.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We assume {a mathematical formula}∑c∈Cpc≤n≤∑c∈Cqc holds.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Next, assume {a mathematical formula}(s,c)∈Ck+1 for some s. It is clear that {a mathematical formula}c∉Cmaxk+1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We assume f is unique-selecting, i.e., for all {a mathematical formula}X′⊆X, there exists a unique {a mathematical formula}X″⊆X′ that maximizes {a mathematical formula}f(X″).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Assume first that it does not contain any contract related to a dummy student.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore, the time complexity of TTCR-SS is {a mathematical formula}O(|S|⋅|C|).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Priority-list based DA with minimum quotas</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">group strategy-proofnessWe say mechanism φ is group strategy-proof if ∀ {a mathematical formula}≻S, there is no {a mathematical formula}S′⊆S and {a mathematical formula}≻S′′ such that {a mathematical formula}φs(≻S′′,≻−S′)⪰sφs(≻S′,≻−S′){a mathematical formula}∀s∈S′ and for some {a mathematical formula}s∈S′, {a mathematical formula}φs(≻S′′,≻−S′)≻sφs(≻S′,≻−S′).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">On the other hand, {a mathematical formula}sˆℓ+1 has the highest priority in {a mathematical formula}≻ML to represent {a mathematical formula}cˆℓ+1 among those whose assignments are not fixed by the supposition.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">One direction is to design the priority structure of students for a given mechanism [18], [25].</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In particular, {a mathematical formula}(i,i), where {a mathematical formula}(i,i)∈E, is called a self-loop cycle.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">School choice programs have also been identified as an important application domain of TTC [3].</a>
