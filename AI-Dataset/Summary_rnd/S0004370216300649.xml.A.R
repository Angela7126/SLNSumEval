<a href="#0" id="0">Notice that the generated formulas with a high modularity are hard, compared to industrial formulas.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This feature is very characteristic in real-world instances, but it is not a sufficient condition to guarantee community structure.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that this model works appropriately for different input values of number of variables n and clauses m. We also show that, if there exists a phase transition point SAT-UNSAT when the ratio clause/variable is increased, then it does not depend on the modularity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, we observe that the variables belonging to the learnt clause correspond in fact to the variables of the communities where the solver was focused at the beginning of the search.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As for the 1-UIP schema, we represent the decision variables (top), the assigned variables (center), and the variables belonging to the learnt clause (bottom), for the first 2000 conflicts.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In fact, when the value of the number of communities c is high enough (as actual industrial SAT instances have), its relevance in our model is very small, as expressed by Equation (2).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Generating SAT instances with community structure.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We validate the adequacy of this model checking that (i) the community structure of the resulting formulas is the expected, (ii) if there exists a phase transition point dependent on the clause/variable ratio, then it is independent on the modularity, and (iii) the SAT solvers performances are consistent to the structure of the formulas generated by our model, i.e. SAT solvers specialized in industrial (random) problems perform better in high modular (low modular) instances.</a>
