<a href="#2" id="2">Given the ample impact of power in people's decisions, which may be observed in scenarios ranging from simple social interactions [45] to social dilemma situations [3], [78], the ability to understand power-based social dynamics and emulate them in cognitive agents is of fundamental importance for improving such agents' interactive capabilities [14].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Resistance/Control measured the user's control over the agent and the ability to overcome resistance to the user's decisions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Third, the effects on the liking social relation occur in different phases{sup:14} of the social power interaction and are affected by different conditions (e.g., the negative effects of coercion can be nullified).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We argue that by using this model, general social power dynamics are granted to the agents, empowering them with intelligent social power behavior that is independent of the context, thereby facilitating the adaptation of the agents to different situations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Considering the underlying inspiration provided by the typical BDI architecture [8], [65], in the following sections, several components are discussed in further detail, with a focus on their relations to social power processes.</a>
