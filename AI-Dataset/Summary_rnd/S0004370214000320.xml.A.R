<a href="#0" id="0">As the third instantiation, we use both transfer phases, as is described by Algorithm 1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We formulate this constraint as follows.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">After that, we empirically evaluate TRAMP in different settings to see their advantages and disadvantages.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In Fig. 8, we show the learning accuracy of the depots domain with different values of δ. From the figure we can see that accuracies of both TRAMP and ARMS generally increase when the number of plan traces becomes larger in all three values of δ. This is consistent with our intuition, since the larger the number of plan traces is, the more information can be used to help improve the learning accuracy.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Web search also mines data available in databases or open directories, and maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a Web crawler.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the experiment we compared TRAMP to LAWS[73] and t-LAMP[70], to see the advantage or disadvantage of transferring knowledge based on plan traces or the Web or both.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Furthermore, we denote the total number of all the possible preconditions and effects of action models as {a mathematical formula}T(pre) and {a mathematical formula}T(eff), respectively.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We also would like to evaluate if TRAMP functions well when there is no source domain available.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Transferring feature representations aims to find better feature representations to minimize domain divergence and classification or regression model error.</a>
