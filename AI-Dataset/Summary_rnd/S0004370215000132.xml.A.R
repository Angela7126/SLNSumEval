<a href="#0" id="0">In this section we describe this more general view.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our results</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We provide pseudocode for Algorithm C in Fig. 5.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Movie Preferences.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In both cases the goal is to find an optimal assignment, where the optimality is relative to one of the total dissatisfaction or satisfaction functions that we have just introduced.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We claim that for each i, {a mathematical formula}0≤i≤K, it holds that:{a mathematical formula} Why is this so?</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The comparison of various axiomatic properties of multiwinner rules conducted by Elkind et al. [19] shows that variants of STV have many nice properties and, in particular, are rather strong on proportionality.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For other settings we only have hardness results and this notation would not be useful.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Similarly, if K divides {a mathematical formula}‖N‖ and we set the all the capacities to {a mathematical formula}‖N‖K, then we obtain the variants of the problem for the Monroe rule.</a>
