<a href="#0" id="0">But it fails because the grammar for signed number can only build the parse trees for some subsequence (e.g. -3 in -3x).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If {a mathematical formula}S2 contains {a mathematical formula}n2 non-terminal symbols in {a mathematical formula}S2, the number of testing sequences is {a mathematical formula}10n2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Traditional ways to construct models include structured interviews, think-aloud protocols, rational analysis, and so on.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Perceptual processing is modeled by parsing stimuli using this grammar, with the result being a parse tree that organizes their constituents.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The precondition (just before “⇒” in Fig. 3) includes a set of feature tests representing desired conditions in which to apply the production rule.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the first step, the algorithm computes the most probable parse tree for each observation example using the current rules.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Each training record contains a full observation sequence and a set of subsequences (usually just one) associated with the feature.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We then present the deep feature learning algorithm together with its evaluation results.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In order to evaluate whether the extended SimStudent is able to acquire correct knowledge with reduced prior knowledge engineering, we carried out an experiment in the algebra domain.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We also calculated the mean of the predicted error rates for each problem type for both the human-generated model and the SimStudent model.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The acquired preconditions should contain information about both applicability (e.g., getting a coefficient is not applicable to the term 3x+5) and search control (e.g., it is not preferred to add 5 to both sides for problem -3x=6).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This bias appears to be a limitation of SimStudent as a model of student learning.</a>
