<a href="#0" id="0">Several of the existing models of contraction for beliefs sets have been adapted to the case when belief states are represented by belief bases: the partial meet contractions for belief bases were presented in [19], [20], [17]; the kernel contractions—which can be seen as a generalization of safe contractions—were introduced in [21]; and, in [29], Mary-Anne Williams introduced the ensconcement-based contractions (of belief bases), which can be seen as adaptations to the case of belief bases of the epistemic entrenchment-based contractions.</a>

<a href="#2" id="2">Then R satisfies non-retractability of tautology and non-retractability upper bounding if and only if{a mathematical formula}R={α:A∼α⊬α}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In Section 3 we presented several results highlighting some direct relations among the postulates satisfied by a shielded contraction function ∼ induced by a standard contraction ÷ and a set of retractable sentences R and the postulates satisfied by ÷ and the properties of the set R. From the conclusions that can be drawn from those results we highlight the two following ones, concerning the postulates of relative success and persistence:</a>
