<a href="#0" id="0">Thus, b can start anytime after t. However, by applying the compilation on this disjunctive condition we replace b with two actions {a mathematical formula}b1 and {a mathematical formula}b2, one with an at-start condition {a mathematical formula}p1 and the other with an at-start condition {a mathematical formula}p2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If {a mathematical formula}χ=〈⋯,sjbet,⋯,siaet,⋯〉, then the situation is reversed and again the STNU is not strongly controllable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, to strengthen the mutual exclusion predicate we manually checked for all the domains that all the uncontrollable actions were mutually exclusive with themselves, and we forced this information in the mutual-exclusion generator.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Suppose that the duration of a is uncertain in {a mathematical formula}[10,15] (because different matches burn differently), and suppose that b has an overall condition of having light (hence b must be contained in a).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We call the derived technique S-FSSTP.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The general idea we pursue is to substitute the scheduling steps of Algorithm 1 to solve a strong controllability problem for a TNU instead of consistency for a TN.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, we must be careful to not over-constrain the TNU, otherwise we may discard valid plans.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Similarly for case (3).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The only framework available for planning with uncertain duration is probabilistic, while here we focus on exact techniques for Strong planning with interval durations.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The VBS line in the plot solves far more instances than any actual solver; hence, the various solvers that contribute to the VBS are able to solve different sets of instances.</a>
