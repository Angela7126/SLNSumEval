<a href="#0" id="0">For instance what is the meaning of the formula {a mathematical formula}□P(a) when a denotes, in the current world, an object which does not exist in one of the accessible worlds?</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">a set of bridge rules {a mathematical formula}BR, in symbols {a mathematical formula}Γ⊨BRi:ϕ, if for every {a mathematical formula}BR-model {a mathematical formula}M and for every assignment a strictly admissible for Γ, the following holds:{a mathematical formula} DFOL logical consequence bears similarities and differences w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore we can easily build a deduction {a mathematical formula}Πk of {a mathematical formula}ψk from {a mathematical formula}cl(Γ),i:ϕ1∨…∨ϕn.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Assuming that we have a complete description of the box we can build the agents' local knowledge (bases) as views over this complete description.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As we can see from its construction, the resulting model {a mathematical formula}RL(M(2)) satisfies only {a mathematical formula}2:r, {a mathematical formula}1:¬p and {a mathematical formula}2:¬q.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A consequence of this is that the domain relations must be one the inverse of the other.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We illustrate the difference between the closure of Γ and the closure of Γ w.r.t.</a>
