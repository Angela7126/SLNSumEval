<a href="#2" id="2">Indeed, in the proof of Lemma 16, we use that if {a mathematical formula}(∃r.⊤)I(x)=1 for some model {a mathematical formula}I and {a mathematical formula}x∈ΔI, then there must exist a {a mathematical formula}y∈ΔI such that {a mathematical formula}rI(x,y)=1, which cannot be guaranteed for general models.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The precise form of this axiom depends on the expressivity of the logic used.In {a mathematical formula}⊗-AL, we can use the axiom {a mathematical formula}〈C⊑∀r.D〉 to restrict {a mathematical formula}I to satisfy{a mathematical formula} and thus also {a mathematical formula}DI(y)≥CI(x)≥b if {a mathematical formula}u∈{0}⁎.In the case of {a mathematical formula}⊗-ELC, if {a mathematical formula}I is a model of {a mathematical formula}〈∃r.¬D⊑¬C〉, then{a mathematical formula} and thus {a mathematical formula}CI(x)≤DI(y) as in the previous case.Finally, for {a mathematical formula}Ł(0,b)-NEL, we use the axiom {a mathematical formula}〈∃r.⊟D⊑⊟C〉, similar to the one for {a mathematical formula}⊗-ELC.</a>
