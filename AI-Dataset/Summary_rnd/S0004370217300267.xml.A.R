<a href="#0" id="0">Conclusions</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">With no conflicts, abstract arguments corresponding to c and l are guaranteed to have no attacking arguments, and therefore to be in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: in Sections 2–3 we outline our theoretical model, in which we introduce theoretical foundations and develop a formal dialogue system from Lakatos's model of mathematical discourse.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}MonsterReject-ing allows Opponent the same freedom as Proponent in offering a reason for thinking the counterexample does, indeed hold.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Structured argumentation aims to “give a general structured account of argumentation that is intermediate in its level of abstraction between concrete logics and the fully abstract level, providing guidance on the structure of arguments, the nature of attacks, and the use of preferences, while at the same time accommodating a broad range of instantiating logics and allowing for the study of conditions under which the various desirable properties are satisfied by these instantiations” [66, p.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Summary</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A is {a mathematical formula}A1,…,An⇒ψ iff {a mathematical formula}A1,…,An are arguments and there exists a rule{a mathematical formula} in {a mathematical formula}R, and in this case,{a mathematical formula} and {a mathematical formula}TopRule(A)=Conc(A1),…,Conc(An)⇒ψ.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Lastly, ODefinition, which is only used as Opponent's substantiation of their MonsterReject, introduces a new definition, e and symmetrical conflict between that and d. Again, with no resolution between d and e, neither are in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The specific ‘pipeline’ detailed in the later sections of this paper is outlined in Fig. 1c.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We describe updates in three steps.</a>
