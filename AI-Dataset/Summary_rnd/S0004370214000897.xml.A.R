<a href="#0" id="0">However, the VCG mechanism is not strongly budget balanced, that is, the agents' payments do not sum to 0.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The burning allocation mechanisms are mixtures over VCG mechanisms for different numbers of units, and under a partitioning allocation mechanism, for each subgroup of agents that results from partitioning, we use the VCG mechanism to allocate the units assigned to this subgroup.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We note that Example Mechanisms 1 and 2 are the {a mathematical formula}(1,1)-partition mechanism and the {a mathematical formula}(1,0)-partition mechanism, respectively.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Even without redistribution, every agent's utility is at least 0.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For this type profile, burning more than one unit results in a welfare of 0, and as we have proved, the probability of burning one unit is less than {a mathematical formula}1n.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The intuition behind the proposed mechanism is as follows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Transfer all the VCG revenue to the excluded agent.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We conclude that the mechanism is feasible.Now we show that the mechanism has competitive ratio {a mathematical formula}mn−nmn−m.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">So, ironically, in some cases, the agents are happier if one unit is burned.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The individual rationality constraint is that for all type profiles V in which the elements are the {a mathematical formula}vi,j, we must have {a mathematical formula}R⁎(v−i)≥0 for all i and all {a mathematical formula}v−i.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the {a mathematical formula}(n1,m1)-partition mechanism, {a mathematical formula}n1 agents are randomly picked to form one group, and the remaining {a mathematical formula}n−n1 agents form a second group.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We focus on settings where the resource consists of multiple indistinguishable units.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let S be the maximal order consistent class containing V. When we focus only on type profiles in S, for any type profile/matrix V, the i-th highest element is always in a fixed position {a mathematical formula}(j,k).</a>
