<a href="#0" id="0">However, there are some notable differences.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since the non-halting Turing machines are not recursively enumerable, neither are the validities of sopml{sup:⁎} with respect to modal models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, {a mathematical formula}(F,w)⊭⊡(a→), and therefore {a mathematical formula}(F,w)⊭Θ(a→,x).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then there exists a saturated set of formulas Φ over{a mathematical formula}AP∪Y, such that{a mathematical formula}Δ⊂Φ, where Y is an infinite set of new atoms (i.e., disjoint from AP).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">So, for instance, we can have {a mathematical formula}⊡(a)=Refl(a) for {a mathematical formula}Θ⊡(a,x)=Ra(x,x), or {a mathematical formula}⊡(b,c)=Sup(b,c) for {a mathematical formula}Θ⊡(b,c,x)=∀y(Rc(x,y)→Rb(x,y)) (for more examples, see Table 1).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hereafter we do not consider such extensions and keep on a purely epistemic setting.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The formula {a mathematical formula}ψsane imposes a number of sanity constraints: if {a mathematical formula}(M,w) satisfies both {a mathematical formula}ψgrid and {a mathematical formula}ψsane, then {a mathematical formula}M can almost be seen as the execution of a Turing machine.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The validity of axioms Exx in each corresponding class of frames follows by Lemma 11.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is in line with the situation in pml.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A first example of such formulas is {a mathematical formula}∃p¬δ for {a mathematical formula}δ=(◇p∧◇□¬p)→◇(□−1◇p∧□¬p) (here {a mathematical formula}□−1 is interpreted as the converse of relation R for □).</a>
