<a href="#0" id="0">Section 7 concludes this study, with a discussion of future work.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Empirical experiments report three advantages of our proposed competence-based change detection method: 1) a high achieved detection rate, 2) robustness on small sample size, and 3) ability to quantify and describe the changes it detects, which makes it highly suitable for handling local concept drift problems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, the competence closure model is able to uniquely model the entire case-base.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">‘EDDM performs well for gradual changes; however, it is not good at detecting drift in noisy examples’ [48].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, we both resort to a similar approach for concept drift detection: that is, adopting a distance metric and then performing a hypothesis test.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this sense, we propose another competence model – related closure (Definition 7) to represent the problem space with relation to a certain case or a group of cases, in terms of related sets.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, the kdq-tree does not guarantee that a partition will coincide with the real interesting concepts.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The definitions are shown as follows.</a>
