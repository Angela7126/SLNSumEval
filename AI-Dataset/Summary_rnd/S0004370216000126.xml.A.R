<a href="#0" id="0">Several Machine Learning techniques have been used for predicting the run time of optimization algorithms, once again with the aim to perform algorithm selection (e.g. [13], [14]).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Constraint Programming (CP, see [36]) is an Artificial Intelligence technique designed to solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) and Constraint Optimization Problems (COP).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This can lead to a trade-off between model size and accuracy, which may be critical if the final optimization system operates under tight time constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The difference in performance stems from two main reasons: first, the propagation of Neuron Constraints often allows the CP solver to quickly terminate many iterations of the decomposition method.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In EML, a training set can be obtained either by collecting historical data or by running ad-hoc experiments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Analogously, the LS model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax is:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The results for this experimentation are reported in Table 6.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For these reasons, embedding a Machine Learning model requires simply to implement a function evaluator.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A thermal controller that dramatically lowers the core frequency if the temperature exceeds a safety threshold.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We defined our MINLP model in GAMS [46] and we solved it using BARON, via the Neos Servers for Optimization [47].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let us introduce a set of binary variables {a mathematical formula}xik such that {a mathematical formula}xik=1 iff job i is mapped on core k and 0 otherwise.</a>
