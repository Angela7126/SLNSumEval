<a href="#0" id="0">Expansion of universal variables is another successful approach to QBF solving, in addition to backtracking search and Q-resolution.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Based on this observation, we ran the sequence ABCD on the other benchmark sets for at most six rounds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">All experiments were run on a 64-bit Linux Ubuntu 12.04 system with an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550@2.83 GHz and 8 GB of memory.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We describe the four different showcases that we considered in our experiments: the solving showcase is presented in Section 3.1, followed by the preprocessing showcase in Section 3.2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">All experiments were run using a wall-clock time limit of 600 seconds and a memory limit of 3 GB separately for solving (second column in Table 18) and the checking of proofs and the extraction and checking of the certificates (third column in Table 18).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Participating systems and benchmarks</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We carried out separate runs with and without preprocessing using the preprocessor Bloqqer.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the workflows that involve the extraction of Q-resolution proofs, we observed that not only run time but also memory is critical.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this case, a fixpoint has been reached and hence preprocessing can be stopped.</a>
