<a href="#0" id="0">If G does contain an optimal path, then the search graph must always contain either the optimal path, or an unexplored path which costs no more than the optimal path (Lemma 7), which implies that then {a mathematical formula}M⁎ will find the optimal path in finite time (Lemma 2).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, it is effective only when robots are packed densely enough that only a few robots can move at any time [14].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In {a mathematical formula}ODM⁎, {a mathematical formula}A⁎ is replaced as the underlying planner by Operator Decomposition, a variant of {a mathematical formula}A⁎ developed explicitly for multirobot path planning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Four variants of {a mathematical formula}M⁎ are used as points of comparison, {a mathematical formula}MA-CBS(1000)+EPErM⁎, which produces optimal paths, and inflated {a mathematical formula}EPErM⁎ with inflation factors of 1.1, 3, and 10.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The symbols {a mathematical formula}xki and {a mathematical formula}xkj refer to the components of {a mathematical formula}xk describing robots i and j respectively.</a>
