<a href="#0" id="0">The results demonstrate that on random uniform problems, fixed probabilities for both decisions are enough to produce similar results to the results we obtain when using DSA-SDP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In our experiments we considered problems with {a mathematical formula}n=120 agents, {a mathematical formula}k=10 values in each domain, and costs chosen from the range {a mathematical formula}{1,2,…,10}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Agents in Max-Sum perform the roles of different nodes in the factor graph.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The costs in the figure are the local (private) costs calculated for each agent in its state at step i. In the next step, all the leaf agents in the BFS-tree (agents 3, 4, and 5) send their local costs to their parents in the tree and the parents add their private costs to the costs they receive from their children.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In each step (or iteration) of the algorithm an agent sends its assignment to all its neighbors in the constraint graph and receives the assignments of all its neighbors.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">On these denser problems convergence was especially problematic for DisPeL, which took hundreds of steps to build its tree, and MGM-2, which was not even able to find a solution of equal quality to that found by MGM before termination.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Local search algorithms require different amounts of information to be passed between the agents.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Once the root agent receives all the information from its children, it identifies the value assignment that is a part of the optimal solution and propagates it down the pseudo-tree to the rest of the agents, allowing them to find their own value assignment and thus, produce the optimal solution.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Each agent {a mathematical formula}Ai holds a private variable {a mathematical formula}δi which is initially set to ∞.</a>
