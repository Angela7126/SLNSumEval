<a href="#0" id="0">If {a mathematical formula}η(i)=o(i), we use the fact that vendor {a mathematical formula}o(i) attracts (at least) the buyers of type i at equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Finally, assume that {a mathematical formula}q¯j<pj.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We use a reduction from the well-known NP-hard Exact-3-Cover problem (X3C) which is formally described as follows.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Another set of open problems comes from introducing constraints to price competition games such as supply limitations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The (apparently non-exhaustive) list also includes their use in cooperative game theory in order to encourage coalitions of players to reach stability [5] and as a means to stabilize normal form games [19].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We can interpret such an assignment as maximizing the utility of buyers given the price vector p. We will denote by{a mathematical formula} the total utility of buyers of type i given a price vector p and a consistent assignment x.</a>
