<a href="#0" id="0">The examples of Section 6.2 can be transformed into analogous examples for MKNF by replacing each default rule{a mathematical formula} with the MKNF inclusion {a mathematical formula}Kα⊓¬A¬β⊑Kβ, where K is an epistemic operator and the modality {a mathematical formula}¬A is essentially negation as failure.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, the reduction is able to reconstruct the nonmonotonic inferences outlined in Example 9, as stated by Theorem 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Low complexity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A {a mathematical formula}DLN model of a set of {a mathematical formula}DLN axioms {a mathematical formula}S (that may possibly comprise both inclusions and assertions) is a {a mathematical formula}DLN interpretation that satisfies all the axioms in {a mathematical formula}S. As usual, if {a mathematical formula}I is a {a mathematical formula}DLN model of {a mathematical formula}S then we write {a mathematical formula}I⊨S, and if a sentence α is satisfied by all the {a mathematical formula}DLN models of {a mathematical formula}S then we say that α is a logical consequence of {a mathematical formula}S and write {a mathematical formula}S⊨α.</a>
