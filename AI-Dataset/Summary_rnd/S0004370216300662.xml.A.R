<a href="#0" id="0">Note that every answer set of {a mathematical formula}Πˆ resp.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In {a mathematical formula}DL-LiteA, concepts C, denoting sets of objects, and roles R, denoting binary relations between objects, obey the following syntax, where {a mathematical formula}A∈C is an atomic concept and {a mathematical formula}P∈R an atomic role:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}DL-LiteA TBox axioms are then of the form:{a mathematical formula} Axioms where {a mathematical formula}D=C resp.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let now RepAnsSet (Algorithm 3) be the algorithm that iteratively calls RepAns for every {a mathematical formula}Iˆ∈AS(Πˆ), and outputs any {a mathematical formula}Iˆ, where the result of RepAns is nonempty, i.e. some repair {a mathematical formula}A′ was computed.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This happens in case of cyclic support, i.e. recursion through a DL-atom that makes an atom true [37].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence {a mathematical formula}I′ must satisfy {a mathematical formula}B(rk); but since {a mathematical formula}w(b)∉I′, we have that {a mathematical formula}I′⊭rk, leading to a contradiction.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Rules (6*) and (7*) check whether none of the {a mathematical formula}domain nodes is isolated, i.e. does not have a connection to any other node via a route.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">until some {a mathematical formula}A0=μ(O)⊆A results that satisfies Definition 26 (iii).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In abuse of notation, we also write {a mathematical formula}O=T∪A viewing {a mathematical formula}O as a set of formulas.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">(ii) {a mathematical formula}Σ2P-completeness result for arbitrary Π and {a mathematical formula}x=weak.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}Xi(b)∈A′, if {a mathematical formula}ν(xj)=true, and {a mathematical formula}X¯j(b)∈A′, if {a mathematical formula}ν(xj)=false.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Most DL ontologies are fragments of classical first-order logic, and as such lack sufficient expressiveness for the requirements of certain problems; for instance, they cannot model closed-world reasoning, nor can they express nonmonotonicity; these features are often essential in practical application scenarios.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Since the number of districts increased compared to the previous setting, apart from the information about drivers of e-cars, one needs to expand the working area of the drivers too; thus removal of notworksIn facts should again increase the number of obtained repairs.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Our ideas on domain-dependent restrictions on repairs are related to the inconsistency policy for databases discussed e.g. in [78], [63], where the authors presented preference-based techniques for repairing databases.</a>
