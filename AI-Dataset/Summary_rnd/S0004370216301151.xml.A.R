<a href="#1" id="1">The learner's comprehension of teacher utterances improves as more information about words and predicates accumulates in the co-occurrence graph.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the framework of data mining, semantic information might allow us to tackle the problem of scalability by reducing the amount of data the algorithms must consider.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In our example, this includes utterances like the star or the triangle to the right of the purple circle but not star of circle small the green.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our model also accommodates comprehension and production tasks, but we use a different representation of word meaning, that is not based on Frege's principle of compositionality; this (sometimes) allows us to assign a correct meaning to a sentence even if the sentence is not grammatically correct.</a>
