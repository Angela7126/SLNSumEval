<a href="#0" id="0">Covering routeA covering route is a route r where {a mathematical formula}Ar(t)≤d(t) for any {a mathematical formula}t∈T(r).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although the ratios increase as RandRes increases, it is worth noting that the increase is not very significant, being of the order of 0.05 between 10 RandRes and 50 RandRes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This pruning rule is safe since by definition if {a mathematical formula}r′∈CLmin, then all the possible expansions of {a mathematical formula}r′ are unfeasible and if {a mathematical formula}r′⊆r then r can be obtained by expanding from {a mathematical formula}r′.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}C1 denotes the set of all the branches visited according to this form.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is because the branch-and-bound algorithm has a complexity {a mathematical formula}O(|T||T|), while the dynamic programming algorithm has a complexity {a mathematical formula}O(2|T|).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As is customary in the Artificial Intelligence literature [9], [14], we deal with discrete, both in terms of space and time, patrolling settings, representing an approximation of a continuous environment.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">With annotations of dominances and routes generation the whole algorithm yields a worst-case complexity of{a mathematical formula}O(|T(s)|52|T(s)|).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The first result we provide implies that such a representation is very unlikely to exist or that, if it exists, it unlikely can be computed in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Consider a modified version of Algorithm 1 where, when deciding on admissible expansions, we add to Conditions 1–3 the following one: the cost of the newly formed covering set must be smaller than or equal to the penetration time of any target not included in such set.</a>
