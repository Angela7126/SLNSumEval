<a href="#0" id="0">While standard EM, a.k.a.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The statistics are shown in Table 6.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is capable of handling data with only dozens of observed variables and is hence not suitable for text analysis.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One example is shown in Fig. 1(c).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Here one cannot talk about conditional independence between words because the probabilities of all words must sum to 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The result is an HLTM with 5 levels of latent variables and 21 latent variables at the top level.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It calls two subroutines.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">HLTA also differs from the LDA-based methods in several other ways.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Table 4 shows some of the topics from the resulting topic hierarchy.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The first step (line 3) yields the model shown in Fig. 3(a).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then the LTM defines a joint distribution over all observed and latent variables as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We conclude that {a mathematical formula}S is uni-dimensional if the following inequality holds:{a mathematical formula} where Î´ is a user-specified threshold.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Complexity analysis</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The objective of the second step (line 9) is to turn the level 1 latent variables into observed variables through data completion.</a>
