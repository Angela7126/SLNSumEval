<a href="#0" id="0">First, note that by Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, {a mathematical formula}m1 can win the tournament if and only if all players from the set M reach the fifth round.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is therefore no longer available elsewhere.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using the rule of thumb that for current computing architectures, the space requirements of an algorithm become a bottleneck if they exceed the square root of the time requirements, the analyses for {a mathematical formula}y=2 and {a mathematical formula}y=3 currently seem the most relevant.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For PTFP and {a mathematical formula}α≥1, an algorithm is called an α-approximation algorithm for the maximum winning probability if it can find a draw in which the winning probability of the given player i is at least {a mathematical formula}mwp(i,N,P)/α.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Another related problem is checking whether a sports team can still win a round-robin competition when all the matches have not yet been completed [11], [15].</a>
