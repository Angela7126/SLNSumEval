<a href="#0" id="0">A simple (unrealistic) example is if η consists of the two rules{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Tη(DB)≠DB for any database DB.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show that {a mathematical formula}Tη(U′)(α)≥pTη(U)(α) by a case analysis on the definition of {a mathematical formula}Tη(U)(α).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the notion of grounded repair is strictly stronger than both of these: Example 2.6, presented earlier, also shows that some forms of circular justifications are avoided by grounded repairs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}The intended meaning of this rule is: if all the literals in the lefthandside (body) of the rule are true in some state of the database, for particular values of x, y and z, then the database is inconsistent, and this inconsistency can be solved by performing the action on the right.Suppose that the database is{a mathematical formula} This database is inconsistent, and applying our AIC with {a mathematical formula}x=john, {a mathematical formula}y=finance and {a mathematical formula}z=hr gives us a possible fix consisting of the action “remove {a mathematical formula}dept(john,finance)”.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It can be seen from the previous example that for AICs, the Kripke–Kleene semantics is very bad at deriving that something does not need to be changed.</a>
