<a href="#4" id="4">Suppose there is a weakening {a mathematical formula}B′ of B such that {a mathematical formula}(A,B′)∈πi(K).From the induction hypothesis, for each basic defeasible subargument Y of {a mathematical formula}B′, if A rebuts Y then {a mathematical formula}(A,Y)∈πi(K).Let X be a basic defeasible subargument of B such that A rebuts X. Therefore there is a basic defeasible subargument Y of {a mathematical formula}B′ that is a weakening of X. Therefore A rebuts Y. From {a mathematical formula}(A,Y)∈πi(K), it follows that {a mathematical formula}(A,X)∈FAM(πi)(K).</a>
