<a href="#0" id="0">Given a weighted partial CNF formula F, the weighted partial maximum satisfiability (WPMS) problem is to find such a complete assignment which satisfies all hard clauses in F and maximizes the total weight of all satisfied soft clauses in F.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Also, we conduct empirical evaluations to study the combination of CCEHC and the unit propagation initialization and the related experiments show that CCEHC is able to cooperate well with the unit propagation initialization.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When the biased random walk component is called, if there exist any unsatisfied hard clauses, the SLS algorithm first tries to choose an unsatisfied hard clause randomly; otherwise, an unsatisfied soft clause is selected randomly.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The rules of the MAX-SAT Evaluation 2014 establish that the winner is the solver which finds the best solution for the most instances among all competing solvers in the related experiment, breaking ties by preferring the solver with the least averaged time.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the WPMS problem, hard clauses are much more important than soft clauses, as hard clauses are forced to be satisfied in feasible solutions, so we propose a new forbidding strategy of configuration checking, which is based only on the states of hard clauses, named HCSCC (Hard Clauses' States based Configuration Checking).</a>
