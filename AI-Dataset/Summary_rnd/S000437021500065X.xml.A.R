<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}CP+Sky builds dynamically a more concise set by pruning unpromising patterns (the set of representative patterns of {a mathematical formula}CP+Sky is included in the set of representative patterns of Aetheris) (cf.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our study is interesting for several reasons.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To the best of our knowledge, only certain types of pattern in sequence mining have been successfully studied [62], [63].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Fig. 5c.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The dual approach is used to maximize a measure.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A major issue in chemoinformatics is to establish relationships between chemicals and their activity in (eco)toxicity.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, the order in which candidates are produced in the first step influences the way the dominated area is enlarged, and therefore the effectiveness of {a mathematical formula}CP+Sky.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let {a mathematical formula}I be a set of distinct literals called items, an itemset (or pattern) corresponds to a non-empty subset of {a mathematical formula}I. These patterns are gathered together in the language {a mathematical formula}L: {a mathematical formula}L=2I\∅.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The end-user can either output this concise representation or the entire list of skypatterns as a final step depending on the application needs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For instance, from our running example, {a mathematical formula}Dis⊂(L,{freq})={A,B,C,D,E,F,AD,AE,BC,BD,BE,CD,CE,DE} and {a mathematical formula}Dis⊃(L,{freq})={A,D,E,AB,AC,ABCDEF}.</a>

<a href="#11" id="11">This process stops when we cannot enlarge the dominated area further, i.e. there exists n s.t.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The second (i.e. the post-processing) step is the same for both methods and is performed using the same classical algorithm: the BNL approach [21].</a>
