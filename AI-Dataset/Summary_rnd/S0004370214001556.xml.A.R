<a href="#0" id="0">However, the intuition behind these properties depends heavily on the assumption of public actions and on the separation of actions into two classes: knowledge-producing actions that only return sensing information, and ordinary actions that only affect the state of the world.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The idea is to reduce a query about some future situation to a query about the current situation only.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our use of Poss in the axioms for knowledge could easily be replaced with predicates axiomatising actions that are, for example, Permissable or Motivated.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In such theories successor state axioms have the following form:{a mathematical formula} The effects of an action are thus independent of the situation in which it is performed.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is similar to the “fluent change” actions proposed by De Giacomo et al. [6], but embedded in the theory itself rather than generated by the agent when it discovers that it must update its beliefs.</a>
