<a href="#1" id="1">Without loss of generality, we give the proof only for the case of filters that are atomic {a mathematical formula}L-constraints (Definition 6.16).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Subsumption of mappings [75]Let {a mathematical formula}μ1,μ2 be mappings.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Now, to see why {a mathematical formula}⋂G∈G〚q〛HG⊇⋂H∈H〚q〛H, notice that the relation can be written as {a mathematical formula}⋂〚q〛HG⊇⋂〚q〛H where {a mathematical formula}HG≡{H∈H|H⊆G for some G∈G}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In stRDF, such combinations of constraints are given as literals of type SemiLinearPointSet.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, there exist PCL-constraints {a mathematical formula}R(u,v) for all possible pairs of the terms {a mathematical formula}u,v appearing in Ψ such that {a mathematical formula}Ψ′≡⋀u,v∈terms(Φ)R(u,v) is satisfiable and in agreement with σ. By construction, there exists {a mathematical formula}DNFi(Φ) such that {a mathematical formula}σ(DNFi(Φ)) is true, and therefore, {a mathematical formula}DNFi(Φ) should be consistent as a subformula of {a mathematical formula}Ψ′.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The intended structure for this language, {a mathematical formula}MECL, interprets symbol EQ as equality and constants as “themselves”.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, a renaming function used in formula (1) could have possibly renamed a blank node to a fresh one regarding G, but not a fresh one regarding H, i.e., that blank node could have been already in H.d) Consider a query {a mathematical formula}q=(E,P)∈QWDC′ and let {a mathematical formula}G,H be two RDF graphs such that {a mathematical formula}G⊆H.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The same knowledge can be represented by a (possibly infinite) set of possible RDF graphs, one for each rectangle inside P. Two of these graphs are:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Hence, we showed that every triple of H is a triple of {a mathematical formula}v(D′).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Following ideas from the incomplete information literature [41], [30], we develop a semantics for {a mathematical formula}RDFi databases and SPARQL query evaluation.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">An important property of monotone SPARQL queries is that they preserve coinitiality.</a>
