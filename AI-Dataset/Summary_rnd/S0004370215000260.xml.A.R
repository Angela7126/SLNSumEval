<a href="#0" id="0">As in the Control-based approach, Scalability and Robustness are again two major issues in this approach; in fact, achieving Scalability and Robustness remains a challenge even in real-world single-agent Reinforcement Learning problems, let alone in multi-agent problems like SRP [19].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As an integral part of classical AI planning methods, search techniques are widely used in solving constraint satisfaction and optimization problems, where all possible solutions to a problem can be represented in the form of a graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) called Search Space in which each node {a mathematical formula}v∈V represents a solution to the problem and each edge {a mathematical formula}e(v,w)∈E corresponds to the total cost of transition from node v to node w[128].</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">In other words, the reconfigurability of modular robots can be utilized for developing versatile grippers able to grasp objects with unknown sizes or shapes.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It also has been utilized in an XML-based scripting language to define complex and scalable gaits of modular robots with many degrees of freedom [203].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, the solution methods of the Flow operation slightly vary from the SRP solution methods.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Another study on creating a ‘flexible surface’ with supporting legs was conducted by Yu et al. [201] in which a distributed feedback control algorithm continuously iterates between two steps: (i) collecting tilt sensor information from neighboring surfaces and computing an aggregation feedback in ‘pivot’ modules (those that connect legs to the surface), and (ii) controlling actuation of each module in the legs according to the received aggregated feedback.</a>
