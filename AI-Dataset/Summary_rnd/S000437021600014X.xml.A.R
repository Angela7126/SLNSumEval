<a href="#0" id="0">When the rover reaches the exit location it receives a cost proportional to the number of good rocks that remain unsampled.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Other approaches such as SARSOP [28], anytime POMDP [41], ZMDP [45] are only for discounted setting, and hence are different from our approach.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We start with an upper bound on the optimal cost and the qualitative problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Exact optimal cost problems: The problem {a mathematical formula}ExOptCost (resp., {a mathematical formula}ExOptAsCost) asks whether there exists a strategy {a mathematical formula}σ∈Σ (resp., {a mathematical formula}σ∈AlmostG(T)) such that {a mathematical formula}Val(σ)≤λ.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given a belief support {a mathematical formula}U∈BeliefWin(G,T) and a state {a mathematical formula}s∈U let {a mathematical formula}TAllow(s,U) denote the expected total cost of the strategy {a mathematical formula}σAllow starting in the state s with the initial belief support U. Then the upper bound is defined as {a mathematical formula}UAllow=maxU∈BeliefWin(G,T),s∈U⁡TAllow(s,U).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus our lower bound shows a strongly double exponential lower bound (which does not depend on the representation of the costs) on the number of steps.</a>
