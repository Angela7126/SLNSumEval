<a href="#0" id="0">We construct a winning coalition that covers exactly m tasks from the truth assignment A as follows: each clause {a mathematical formula}cj is satisfied through at least one of the literals, say literal x in {a mathematical formula}cj, denoted {a mathematical formula}lj,x.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If the core is empty, then any division of the payoffs is unstable and it is typical to consider relaxed solutions such as the least-core, which seeks to find an allocation of gains to agents in order to minimize the maximum possible gain that any coalition could achieve by breaking away.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the other hand, for some CSG forms, even testing whether the core is empty is computationally hard, whereas a core imputation always exists in a linear production game, and can be found in polynomial time.</a>
