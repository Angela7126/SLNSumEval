<a href="#1" id="1">Without going into details, one can already see that unlike Hoare's logic, our axiomatization does not make use of loop invariants.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, we say that a structure I of {a mathematical formula}LX→ is the primed-projection of M if for any symbol τ in {a mathematical formula}LX→, if τ does not have a primed version in {a mathematical formula}ΠPX→, then its interpretation in I is the same as its in M, but if τ has a primed version, then its interpretation in I is according to {a mathematical formula}τ′ in M. We have If M is a model of{a mathematical formula}ΠPX→, then there is a model{a mathematical formula}[M1,...,Mk]of P such that{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}Conversely, if{a mathematical formula}[M1,...,Mk]is a model of P, then there is a model M of{a mathematical formula}ΠPX→such that(A.1)and(A.2)hold.We prove the first half of the proposition.</a>
