<a href="#0" id="0">Standard backpropagation (BP)</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that the parabolic trajectories contained in the upper half plane intersect the critical hyperbola in only one point and therefore the equation has a single real root.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a result, the matrix {a mathematical formula}AT, hence A, has two identical eigenvalues.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Overall they are very similar to those obtained on the MNIST dataset.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}ΣII=E(IIt) and {a mathematical formula}ΣTI=E(TIt) are {a mathematical formula}N×N matrices associated with the data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">So an ingredient that seems to matter is to let the synapses of neurons that are not saturated change more than the synapses of neurons that are saturated ({a mathematical formula}f′ close to 0).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, for comparison, in the case of gradient descent, the system is given by:{a mathematical formula} Except for trivial cases, the critical points are again given by Equation (116), and the system always converges to a critical point.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Otherwise, if{a mathematical formula}Q>0in the corresponding interval, there is no long time solution and{a mathematical formula}x(t)diverges to +∞ within a finite horizon.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To find its leading term we have:{a mathematical formula} and thus the leading term of Q is given by {a mathematical formula}Ka13 where:{a mathematical formula} Thus the leading term of Q has a negative coefficient, and therefore {a mathematical formula}a1 always converges to a finite fixed point, and so do all the other variables.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, using the learning channel, we are interested in local learning rules of the form:{a mathematical formula} In fact, here we shall focus exclusively on learning rules with the multiplicative form:{a mathematical formula} corresponding to a product of the presynaptic activity with some kind of backpropagated error information, with standard BP and RBP as a special cases.</a>
