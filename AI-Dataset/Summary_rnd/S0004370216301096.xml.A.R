<a href="#0" id="0">From Theorem 30 we know that such an algorithm exists.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Remarks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since {a mathematical formula}f(K) is {a mathematical formula}o(K), there is some value {a mathematical formula}Kϵ such that for each {a mathematical formula}K≥Kϵ it holds that {a mathematical formula}K−f(K)K≥ϵ.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We believe that our model is very general.</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">Introduction</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This completes the proof.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First, such OWAs yield utility functions that are not necessarily submodular and, so, it is impossible to apply the result of Nemhauser et al. [46].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The idea behind the algorithm is as follows: To pick K items, it proceeds in K iterations and in each iteration it introduces one new item into the winner set.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">With similar motivations, Swamy and Shmoys [57] studied the facility location problem with facilities vulnerable to failures.</a>

<a href="#11" id="11">If some of the items are unavailable, an agent chooses to use the best yet available one.</a>
