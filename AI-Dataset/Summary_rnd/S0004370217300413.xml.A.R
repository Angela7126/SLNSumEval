<a href="#0" id="0">The aim of the present article is to formulate and investigate the main computational questions relating to equilibrium checking.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Finally, the definitions of outcome (that is, of {a mathematical formula}Kσ→), consistency, and Nash equilibrium with respect to profiles {a mathematical formula}σ→ of consistent non-deterministic strategies are straightforwardly extended.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Lines (8)–(18) then extend these initial states to compute all reachable states of the system.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Having such an arena to play the game informally means that, in an iBG, it is assumed that in every state all agents can update the values of all the variables they control; note that, in contrast, in an LTL RMG only the variables that are in the scope of enabled guarded commands can be updated.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Fig. 6 further illustrates the transitions between valuations that are induced by enabled guarded commands.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If {a mathematical formula}(ρ,0)⊨φ, we write {a mathematical formula}ρ⊨φ and say that ρ satisfies φ. We say that φ and ψ are equivalent if for all ρ we have {a mathematical formula}ρ⊨φ if and only if {a mathematical formula}ρ⊨ψ.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}Tα is the set of propositions that must be true in order for α to be executed; {a mathematical formula}Fα is the set of propositions that must be false in order for α to be executed; {a mathematical formula}Dα is the set of propositions that characterise those facts made false by the performance of α (the delete list); and {a mathematical formula}Aα is the set of propositions that characterise those facts made true by the performance of α (the add list).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{sup:1}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The behaviour of the system is described by the modules' specifications.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We will analyse all possible cases and show that in each instance at least one of the players has a beneficial deviation.</a>
