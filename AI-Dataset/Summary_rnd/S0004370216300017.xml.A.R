<a href="#0" id="0">Therefore, player 1 has a response {a mathematical formula}σ′ to the challenge {a mathematical formula}tail(σk−1)↝2Σtail(σk).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then {a mathematical formula}a↝([R],τ) and, by the construction of {a mathematical formula}G and {a mathematical formula}M, {a mathematical formula}(a,a⋅([R],τ))∈RM and, by item 1, {a mathematical formula}a⋅([R],τ)∈BM, whence {a mathematical formula}a∈(∃R.B)M.Now, suppose {a mathematical formula}σ∈(∃R.B)M. Then there is {a mathematical formula}σ′ such that {a mathematical formula}(σ,σ′)∈RM and {a mathematical formula}σ′∈BM.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Observe first that {a mathematical formula}Ke is also a universal CQ-solution with nulls.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This gives us the graph {a mathematical formula}T1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Using the map h, one can now construct the required starting states satisfying (6), and ω-winning strategies in {a mathematical formula}GΣg(G2,G1X) in exactly the same way as in the proof of {a mathematical formula}(a)⇒(b) in Lemma 30.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If {a mathematical formula}K⊨q(a) then, by Lemma 10, {a mathematical formula}M⊨q(a).</a>
