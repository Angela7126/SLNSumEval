<a href="#0" id="0">(⊇) Assume we have an {a mathematical formula}ωV, which is element of the right-hand set, i.e. for which there is a Φ, such that {a mathematical formula}ML[Φ]⊨q and {a mathematical formula}⋀φ∈Φφ(ωV).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We consider the theoretical properties in terms of complexity of the proposed algorithm as key result for showing its potential and discuss those results in Section 7.3.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Relaxing the exact inference conditions using credal sets</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Constraint primal graphThe constraint primal graph of a CNF including constraints, is the undirected graph with all random variables occurring in the CNF as nodes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to reach the second compartment the fire in the first one has to be extinguished.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Tree decomposition(See [54].)</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As discussed before, the basic idea is to assign probability masses to sets of values.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Exact inference algorithms have also been developed for the imprecise case.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Based on this semantics we introduce a new probabilistic constraint logic programming (PCLP) language, in which independent probability distributions of random variables are defined by means of a set of probability-constraint pairs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To do that one can divide the sample space of a single variable {a mathematical formula}Vi in n intervals {a mathematical formula}(l1,u1),…,(ln,un) where for all j: {a mathematical formula}lj≤uj, {a mathematical formula}lj may be a real number or −∞ and {a mathematical formula}ui may be a real number or ∞.</a>
