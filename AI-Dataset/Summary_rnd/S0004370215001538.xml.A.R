<a href="#0" id="0">In other words, can a system receive RPM instances and letter series problems in any order, without being notified that the task has changed?</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First, there is a possibility that AI techniques are not appropriate (or too specific) to solve these problems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Recent explosion: 2010â€“today A surge of new systems has taken place since 2010.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">All these techniques, computationally infeasible in previous decades (due to the hardware and software requirements), have shown that they perform surprisingly well in those kind of tasks and, thus, are valid alternatives to the verbal representations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In 2011 IBM's program Watson [4], [5] was the winner of the Jeopardy!</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this regard, one important notion is the distinction between fluid and crystallised intelligence [45].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Third, matrix completion problems were arranged [129, Chapter 6].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A different attempt to address a psychometric test with the aim of understanding humans' cognitive mechanisms was Phaeaco [101], which focussed on Bongard problems [102].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">What is the correspondence between the areas in AI and the abilities covered in intelligence tests?</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It would be very useful for AI to arrange these problems, record the results of computer models and humans over them and organise competitions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The rest of the paper is organised as follows.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In February 2011, Douglas K. Detterman, the editor-in-chief of Intelligence wrote an editorial after seeing how successful IBM's program Watson [4] (the recent winner of the Jeopardy!</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Typically, problems are carefully constructed in such a way that there is a unique solution.</a>
