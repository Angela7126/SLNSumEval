<a href="#0" id="0">A lazy decomposition{a mathematical formula}ψ={ψ1,…,ψk} is a partition of {a mathematical formula}{ϕ1,…,ϕn} into k disjoint subsets of clauses.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Admittedly, PZ3 cannot outperform Z3 on all kinds of problems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider two sets of formulae {a mathematical formula}FM={ϕ|ϕM=true} and {a mathematical formula}FM¯={ϕ|ϕM=false}, then we have {a mathematical formula}F=(⋀ϕ∈FMϕ)∧(⋀ρ∈FM¯¬ρ) such that {a mathematical formula}M▷F holds.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The second one is to measure PZ3's parallel efficiency on a set of randomly generated problems in order to validate our hypothesis on the relationship between problem structure and PZ3's parallel efficiency.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence {a mathematical formula}h−1 is also an isomorphism of {a mathematical formula}M2 into {a mathematical formula}M1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is because Ackermann's reduction introduces auxiliary constants along with additional constraints of function congruence for a large number of applications of uninterpreted functions, and thus the equality graph becomes dense.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For each n-ary function {a mathematical formula}f∈Σ and {a mathematical formula}d1,…,dn∈D1, we have {a mathematical formula}h(fM1(d1,…,dn))=hb(fM2(ha(d1),…,ha(dn))=fM3(h(d1),…,h(dn).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">RefineSharedInterp: refine the shared interpretation RefineSharedInterp refines the valuations of shared function symbols in {a mathematical formula}MS in order to make {a mathematical formula}MS have valuations on all the shared function applications over {a mathematical formula}M1,…,Mk.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Solving subformulae We check the satisfiability of {a mathematical formula}ψ1 on thread {a mathematical formula}T1 and {a mathematical formula}ψ2 on thread {a mathematical formula}T2.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Experimental evaluation</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The work stealing mechanism could be integrated to improve the parallel efficiency.</a>
