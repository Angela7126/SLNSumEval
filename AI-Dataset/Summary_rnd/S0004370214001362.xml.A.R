<a href="#1" id="1">Using this generalisation we were able to increase the cold-start discovery of tracks, while maintaining a recommendation quality comparable to a tag-based recommender system.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For each query in our test set, we make 10 recommendations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">During the past decade a massive shift has occurred in the way that people store, listen to and discover music.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The horizontal axis shows the number of tags the query track has, and the vertical axis shows the mean association score achieved for these tracks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These lines are the two extreme scenarios of cold-start and well-tagged in our system.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">One of the most widely-used descriptors for music recommendation however is texture, also known as timbre [6].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The reason for this is that a tag-based representation will tend to have a few strong tags, and a moderate number of weak tags.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We take inspiration for our work from a more simple approach, which has been used for style and mood annotation [22], [23], and for propagating semantic information [24].</a>
