<a href="#0" id="0">the realizations of the random component of the mechanism, such integral can be easily estimated by using samples [37].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The plot in Fig. 12 represents the dependency of the relative regret w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">the general case described in Section 3.1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The boundUp to numerical constants and logarithmic factors, the previous bound on {a mathematical formula}RT=O˜(T23KN13).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">τ leads to{a mathematical formula} which leads to{a mathematical formula}Once replaced τ in the bound, we obtain{a mathematical formula}Finally, we choose δ and μ to optimize the asymptotic order by setting{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The final bound is{a mathematical formula} Given that {a mathematical formula}δ<1 this implies that {a mathematical formula}T>N and, given that {a mathematical formula}μ<1 we have that {a mathematical formula}T>NK3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Despite the noise, the ratio seems not to be affected by the variation of T, confirming our bound.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We conclude the analysis of the position-dependent model studying, in Section 4.3, the case where both {a mathematical formula}{Λm}m∈K and {a mathematical formula}{qi}i∈N are unknown by the auctioneer, showing that it is possible to obtain DSIC in expectation w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">On the one hand, it is important to gather information about the effectiveness of the two treatments by repeatedly providing them at different patients (exploration).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For specific cases, in which some parameters are known to the auctioneer, we obtained better results in terms of either incentive compatibility, obtaining dominant strategy truthfulness, or regret, obtaining a regret of zero.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The critical issue here is that the samples from slots below the first are drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with parameter obtained by the product of {a mathematical formula}Λm and {a mathematical formula}qi, and it is not trivial to find a method to use these samples to improve the estimates.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The proof is by counterexample.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let{a mathematical formula}Gbe an arbitrary space of allocation functions, then for any{a mathematical formula}g∈G, when{a mathematical formula}|qi−q˜i+|≤ηwith probability{a mathematical formula}1−δ, then for any{a mathematical formula}vˆwe have{a mathematical formula}with probability{a mathematical formula}1−δ.</a>
