<a href="#0" id="0">More formally, {a mathematical formula}Ci is the subgraph that is induced by the edges of C by which {a mathematical formula}xi is reachable.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This longest conjunction is unique and thus well-defined, since the solution space is closed under conjunction by Theorem 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That means {a mathematical formula}H(π1,…,πn)=Hj(π1,…,πn) for some {a mathematical formula}j∈{1,2}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, such an extension of {a mathematical formula}H|D(S) with 0 for all undefined arguments produces exactly the minimal solution {a mathematical formula}(Hmin)|D(S).</a>
