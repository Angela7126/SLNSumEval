<a href="#0" id="0">Depending on the value of k (the length of the chain in {a mathematical formula}S) and the heuristic H used, Optimal-SSP-Solver can return either {a mathematical formula}π0 or {a mathematical formula}π1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By assumption, {a mathematical formula}Ss,t has unavoidable loops, so the maximum size of a trajectory generated by {a mathematical formula}πs,t⁎ is unbounded.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For instance, for the SSP depicted in Fig. 1, the trajectories generated by the closed and improper policy {a mathematical formula}π2={(s0,a1),(s1,a0)} have infinite size, and at each time step, a strictly positive immediate cost is incurred; therefore, {a mathematical formula}Vπ2(s0)=Vπ2(s1)=∞.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the triangle tire world problems 3 and 4, {a mathematical formula}t=32 is large enough that an ϵ-consistent solution is found using a single short-sighted SSP, so the performance of SSiPP and Labeled-SSiPP for {a mathematical formula}t=32 is equivalent to the LRTDP performance.</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">And to avoid generating large short-sighted SSPs, we stop Generate-Short-Sighted-SSP after 15 seconds or if {a mathematical formula}|Ss,t|>105.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This probabilistic version of blocks world also contains three new actions that allow towers of two blocks to be manipulated: pick-tower, put-tower-on-block, and put-tower-down.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the task of quickly finding a suboptimal solution to an SSP, our results indicate that SSiPP-FF successfully combines the behavior of SSiPP and FF-Replan: for problems without dead ends, SSiPP-FF performance is similar to FF-Replan performance (the best planner for problems without dead ends); and for problems with dead ends, SSiPP-FF performs better than FF-Replan and similarly to SSiPP.</a>
