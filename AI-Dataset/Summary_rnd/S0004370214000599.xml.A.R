<a href="#0" id="0">That is each {a mathematical formula}Δl describes a different set of channel relationships.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In addition, given fixed model parameters, our model can fit the channel and event state sequences of an hour's worth of 64-channel EEG data in a matter of minutes on a single 8-core machine, possibly facilitating epileptologist EEG annotation of long-term monitoring records.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Recall that our formulation involves {a mathematical formula}N+1 independently evolving Markov chains: N chains for the channel states {a mathematical formula}zt(i) plus one for the event state sequence {a mathematical formula}Zt.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We compared a dense factorial BP-AR-HMM (entailing a fully-connected spatial graph) and a sparse factorial BP-AR-HMM on five datasets of 8, 16, 32, 64, and 96 channels (from three 32-channel electrodes) from the same seizure used previously.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, we use the superscript indexing on these two sets of indices to select the corresponding portions of the {a mathematical formula}yt vector and the {a mathematical formula}Azt, {a mathematical formula}Y˜T, and {a mathematical formula}ΔZt−1 matrices.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have aligned the three events relative to the beginnings of the red event state common to all three, which we treat as the start of the epileptic activity.</a>
