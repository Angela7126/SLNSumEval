<a href="#0" id="0">In this section, we define social networks (SNs), illustrate generalized annotated programs (GAPs) from [35], and show how diffusion models can be expressed with GAPs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The basic idea is to coarsen the original social network {a mathematical formula}S into a smaller network {a mathematical formula}S′ which tries to preserve the “diffusive behavior” of {a mathematical formula}S. The top-k vertices are then computed over {a mathematical formula}S′ and the solution is mapped back to a subgraph of {a mathematical formula}S on which we again compute the top-k vertices.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The time ratio (denoted {a mathematical formula}ratiotime) is simply the ratio of time taken by CBAF vs. HyperDC.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By leveraging Proposition 1, the HyperDC algorithm computes one least fix point for each vertex, so its worst-case time complexity is given by the number of vertices ({a mathematical formula}|V|) times the worst-case time complexity of the HyperLFP algorithm (which is {a mathematical formula}O(|N|+1α⋅|H|⋅(log⁡|H|+Umax⋅(Smax+log⁡|H|)))) called at line 17.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Suppose d is male and everyone else is female; initially nobody is an {a mathematical formula}adopter.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We conduct a very detailed experimental study on several real-world social networks.</a>
