<a href="#0" id="0">We use {a mathematical formula}dependT(A) to denote the set of all symbols X such that A depends on X. We can now make precise what it means for {a mathematical formula}T to contain no cyclic definitions: {a mathematical formula}A∉dependT(A), for all {a mathematical formula}A∈NC.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As {a mathematical formula}di′ is reachable from x, we obtain {a mathematical formula}x∈NiJ due to (B.5).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It thus remains to note that we can use a small variation of the reduction from Σ-entailment to Σ-inseparability given in the proof of Lemma 3, replacing Σ-inseparability with checking self-contained modules.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that many A that have a direct Σ-dependency also have an indirect Σ-dependency.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This suggests that the subset signatures are highly non-random and can ‘hit’ the part of Snomed ct where terms are not fully defined.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, we report on the resource consumption by both methods.</a>
