<a href="#0" id="0">Thus, the expected steps for a success when starting from a population containing {a mathematical formula}i+1 Pareto optimal solutions is at most {a mathematical formula}4(n−1)2(i+1)(n−i).Because two offspring solutions need to be evaluated in one reproduction step, the running time of one step is counted as 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We give some examples to show that {a mathematical formula}Ngc is usually larger than 0.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For two solutions x and {a mathematical formula}x′∈X:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Because the solutions in the population are non-dominated, the corresponding values on the second dimension must decrease, i.e., they are {a mathematical formula}∑i=1n2n+1−ivi,∑i=2n2n+1−ivi,…,2vn,0, respectively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For {a mathematical formula}1n20n2, if the 0 bit is mutated, the offspring solution will be accepted.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">□</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Some running time bounds in Table 2 are not tight, which makes the comparison of performance between MOEAs not strict.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The remaining {a mathematical formula}m−|Ps1| solutions are randomly chosen from the population excluding {a mathematical formula}Ps1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Section 6 concludes.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Letʼs look at the path of Example 1.</a>

<a href="#11" id="11">By replacing the one-bit mutation operator which searches locally in SEMO with the bit-wise mutation operator which searches globally, the global SEMO (GSEMO) algorithm [18] was proposed and analyzed.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">After the initialization, the two Pareto optimal solutions {a mathematical formula}1n and {a mathematical formula}1n20n2 have been found.</a>
