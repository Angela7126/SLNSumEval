<a href="#0" id="0">Again, by setting NEFCS as the control classifier, the Bonferroni–Dunn test reports a significant improvement in LP over ENN {a mathematical formula}(z>10), IB3 {a mathematical formula}(z>10), Full CB {a mathematical formula}(z=7.9), and PECS {a mathematical formula}(z=3.7) at a confidence level of 95%, and a significant improvement in LR over IB3 {a mathematical formula}(z=4.6) at a confidence level of 95%.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have made a minor modification to the original BBNR algorithm [5] in line-5 to ensure that no previously removed cases will be taken into coverage consideration.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Because the problem space is very sparse, starting with an extremely small training size {a mathematical formula}N=k makes the original FISH2 quite unsuitable for the spam filtering domain.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These instances can be weighted according to their “age”, or their competence with regard to the current concept [13].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Although the FISH family is reported to be capable of cooperating with any base classifier, the validation set is chosen based on nearest neighbors to the current target instance.</a>
