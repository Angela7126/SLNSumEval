<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}β=A⊑B∈G, then {a mathematical formula}M⊨subClass(A,B,g).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, such assumptions of exceptions must be justified: the instance of α for e must be provable to be unsatisfiable at the local context.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The datalog engine that we used to test the computation of the answer sets of the translated programs (and in the computation of the global context structure) is the latest DLV solver.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For model checking of CAS-semantics, we then obtain the following result.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This however contradicts that S is a clashing set for {a mathematical formula}〈α,e〉, as {a mathematical formula}S∪{α(e)} would be satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">proof of Lemma 4); as there are polynomially many {a mathematical formula}ϕi, the test {a mathematical formula}ϕK″⊨ψα is feasible in polynomial time.The proof for global entailment {a mathematical formula}K⊨α is similar; this proves the result.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Formally, a regular order is a strict partial order ≺ on roles such that, for any roles {a mathematical formula}R,S, {a mathematical formula}R≺S iff {a mathematical formula}R−≺S.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence the inheritance rule prop-subc is not applicable and {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD)⊭instd(fbmatch,Interesting,cultural_tourist,main).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">By construction of {a mathematical formula}I(Iˆ(χ)) this implies that {a mathematical formula}unsat(nlit(a,B,c))∈I(Iˆ(χ)), meaning that {a mathematical formula}I(c)⊨¬B(a).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula}A∈NCΣ‾.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We describe in the following the “translation process” to produce, given a CKR {a mathematical formula}K=〈G,{Km}m∈M〉 in {a mathematical formula}SROIQ-RLD normal form, a program {a mathematical formula}PK(K) that encodes query answering from the CKR-models of {a mathematical formula}K:</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In the previous definition, conditions (i) and (ii) verify that the global interpretation {a mathematical formula}M satisfies the (strict and defeasible) axioms in {a mathematical formula}G. Condition (iii) states that each local interpretation {a mathematical formula}I(x) satisfies all local modules {a mathematical formula}Km that are associated with context x. Moreover, by condition (iv), all strict axioms from global object knowledge in {a mathematical formula}G need to be satisfied in local interpretations.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Complex concepts (complex roles) are recursively defined as the smallest sets containing all concepts and roles that can be inductively constructed using the usual concept constructors ¬, ⊓, ⊔, ∃, ∀ etc.</a>
