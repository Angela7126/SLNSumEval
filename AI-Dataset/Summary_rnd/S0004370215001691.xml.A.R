<a href="#1" id="1">The first column mentions the name of the considered data instance.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}I be a set of items, {a mathematical formula}D={(0,ti),…,(n−1,tn−1)} a transaction database over {a mathematical formula}I, and k and min strictly positive integers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Closed patterns</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">All primitive constraints of the language are modeled and solved using the SAT framework.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, on Top-k sequence mining, MaxMotif (in two steps) is several orders of magnitude better.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this section, our aim is to illustrate the nice declarative aspects of our proposed framework.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Secondly, we introduce our first application of our declarative framework to data mining.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We first propose a constraint allowing to consider only the itemsets of length at least min.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">I is closed if, for all itemset J with {a mathematical formula}I⊂J, {a mathematical formula}S(J,D)<S(I,D).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">One direction is the study of (preferred/Top-k) model enumeration algorithm so as to achieve a further speedup of the runtime.</a>
