<a href="#0" id="0">This means that there are some hypotheses that are not strongly equivalent (when combined with the background knowledge), but {a mathematical formula}ILPLOAS cannot distinguish one from the other.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A hypothesis {a mathematical formula}H⊆SM is said to be an inductive solution of {a mathematical formula}Tb (written {a mathematical formula}H∈ILPb(Tb)) if and only if {a mathematical formula}∃A∈AS(B∪H) such that {a mathematical formula}E+⊆A and {a mathematical formula}E−∩A=∅.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We would argue that this level of one-to-one-distinguishability is unnecessary as in ILP, we aim to learn programs whose output explains the examples.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider the {a mathematical formula}ILPb task {a mathematical formula}Tb=〈P,∅,〈∅,∅〉〉.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, we present a new notion of the generality of a learning framework.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this paper, we explore both the expressive power and the computational complexity of each framework.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Deciding both verification and satisfiability for{a mathematical formula}ILPbreduces polynomially to the corresponding{a mathematical formula}ILPsmdecision problem.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">}, with the task {a mathematical formula}〈{0{p}1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">So {a mathematical formula}〈B,H1,H2〉∈D11(ILPb).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let {a mathematical formula}〈B,H,S1〉,…,〈B,H,Sn〉∈Dm1(F).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This is the case if and only if {a mathematical formula}(E1+∪E2+)⊆A, and {a mathematical formula}(E1−∪E2−)∩A=∅ which holds if an only if {a mathematical formula}H∈ILPc(Tc3).Hence, by Lemma 2, {a mathematical formula}ILPc has closed one-to-many-distinguishability.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To tackle this aspect of learning ASP programs, we have extended the Learning from Answer Sets framework to Learning from Ordered Answer Sets ({a mathematical formula}ILPLOAS) [23] and demonstrated that our algorithm{sup:1} is able to learn preferences in a scheduling domain.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This can be seen from the first section of the table, as equal many-to-many-distinguishability implies equal one-to-many-distinguishability, which implies equal one-to-one-distinguishability, but the converse implications do not hold in general.</a>
