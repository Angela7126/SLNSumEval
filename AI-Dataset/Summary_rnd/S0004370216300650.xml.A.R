<a href="#1" id="1">Lemma 4.2 shows that for a given P, the strongest possible {a mathematical formula}φ(y→) is {a mathematical formula}∃x′∈P.c1∧2(x′,y→).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">So the expression becomes{a mathematical formula} We propose the following consequent:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Note that {a mathematical formula}c⁎ still follows our general pattern, by which the pivot is separated and not referred-to by the other disjunct.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Learning in a limited form was present in early CSP solvers, where it was called nogood learning[7].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The reason that this is possible is that the domain reduction by {a mathematical formula}c2 is redundant in the current state, because when {a mathematical formula}u=0, {a mathematical formula}c3 is capable of removing this value by itself.</a>
