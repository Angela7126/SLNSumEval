<a href="#0" id="0">Therefore, fragments of a phrase are also informative in Chinese.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proposed method is an extension of that reported in [9].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A comparison of {a mathematical formula}F(PH_M) and {a mathematical formula}F(PE_M) shows that increasing “Par” degraded the performance for {a mathematical formula}F(PH_M).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To extract relations at the sentence level, a limited number of words is often involved, which yields a sparse feature representation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The F-score is computed as follows.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Table 6 shows the feature assembly performance when all of the candidate features were used, where {a mathematical formula}F(Seg_B) is the segmentation-based method with bin constraint.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Based on the “addition rule”, the collection constraint can reduce the data sparseness.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A more effective approach to using the syntax constraint is to utilize accurate linguistic units in a sentence and to assemble these linguistic units with syntactic information, thereby reducing the errors caused by parsing or tagging.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">At present, relation extraction is often formulated as a classification problem, where a relation takes two entities as arguments (referred to as E1 and E2).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, if “saurus” occurs, then it indicates some species of dinosaur.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Based on this paradigm, various techniques have been proposed, e.g., distant supervision [37], [56], [53] and bootstrapping algorithms [25], [34], [54], matrix factorization [46], and tree kernels [57].</a>
