<a href="#0" id="0">This is done by splitting the original set of states into subsets as the successor tree is traversed.</a>

<a href="#2" id="2">Table 5 evaluates our symbolic search enhancements in {a mathematical formula}BDDA⁎ with symbolic PDBs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The fastest planner receives 1 point, and others receive less points according to a logarithmic scale:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A prominent method for cost-optimal planning is state-space search.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">With this encoding, the image is computed as {a mathematical formula}image(S,To)=(∃xo(S∧To))[xo′/xo].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In most domains, the time score of {a mathematical formula}CT20 is just the maximum of {a mathematical formula}TR1+ and {a mathematical formula}CT, so the parameter is successfully able to control when it is useful to use the conjunction tree approach.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">There is no doubt that symbolic search has the effectiveness to explore large state sets, while the explicit-state heuristics are often more informed.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Uniform-cost search always expands a reachable state with least cost among those yet unexpanded, thus guaranteeing an optimal solution when a goal state is expanded.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In particular, we propose creating a BDD that represents in a succinct way all the states that are valid according to the state invariants.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}f1,f2∈s and the rest of facts are compatible with {a mathematical formula}pre(o).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">All planners used in our experiment use the {a mathematical formula}h2 invariant analysis to remove operators and simplify the planning task before starting the search [57].</a>
