<a href="#0" id="0">When the weak ε-core{sup:+} is non-empty, if the greedy algorithm finds a coalition structure whose value exceeds {a mathematical formula}ECore+(ε), we share the value of the coalition structure so that the payoff vector is in the weak ε-core for the obtained coalition structure.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In these experiments, we set {a mathematical formula}#agents=1000 and vary the number of elements in AC, i.e., {a mathematical formula}|AC| from 1000 to 10 000 (the x-axis).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, we proposed a new solution concept called the weak ε-core{sup:+}, which is based on the weak ε-core for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS⁎.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Check whether {a mathematical formula}y⁎ satisfies the efficiency condition by solving IP-EFF with {a mathematical formula}V⁎=∑i∈Ayi⁎.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This paper is organized as follows.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The algorithm checks whether {a mathematical formula}V(CS⁎) can be divided without making a blocking (dissatisfied) coalition by solving a linear programming (LP) problem [8].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, as long as finding {a mathematical formula}CS⁎ is hard, the least value is difficult to obtain in practice.</a>
