<a href="#0" id="0">A different approach based on Situation Calculus was developed by the AllemaniACs team.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A more detailed description of the competition is available [14], and additional information about it (including photos and videos of the execution of many tests over the years) are in the RoboCup@Home website.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These achievements are critical not only for RoboCup@Home competitions but also for research that integrates AI and robotics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, to analyze the results of teams during the competition in more detail and to compare results over the years, we need a method to measure the performances of the teams in the tests with respect to the desired functionalities.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Object recognition is a core task in all the RoboCup@Home tests.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the first two years (2006â€“2007), the task scores were Boolean: when the task was successfully performed the team received a score, otherwise the score was zero.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The UChile team proposed a Bayesian framework for informed search using convolutions between observation likelihoods and spatial relation masks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Another noteworthy hardware design that achieved similar variety in manipulation heights is that of Homer@uniKoblenz, who combined a simple gripper in the robot base to grasp objects on the ground and an arm on top of the base to manipulate on higher surfaces.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Fig. 2 shows some images of the execution of tests over the years.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This strategy ensures the development of general solutions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To learn the spatial relationships of these identified regions the ISM stores descriptors for the appearance of these object regions in relation to a unique object reference point.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{sup:20} In particular, the specifications of the tests and the changes made during the years are fully described in the rulebooks.</a>
