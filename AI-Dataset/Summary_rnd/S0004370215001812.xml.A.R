<a href="#0" id="0">Hence, the least core of {a mathematical formula}Γ′ is precisely the set {a mathematical formula}{〈1,1〉}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, we assume that variables in {a mathematical formula}{b1,…,bm} always precede all variables in {a mathematical formula}{a1,…,an} in the given ordering.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In fact, the search space is exponential in the size of the representation of the game, but the number of calls made to the oracle is polynomial (w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For instance, the value associated with any rule of a marginal contribution network (and, hence, the payoff associated with any coalition) is a rational number.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">□ Games with nearly-acyclic interaction graphs</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, let us focus on the hardness result for CS-LCV{sup:−}.Let {a mathematical formula}G=(N,E) be an undirected graph over the set {a mathematical formula}N={a1,…,an} of nodes, and let k be a natural number.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, in both cases, by fixing {a mathematical formula}ε=0, we are back to the problem of deciding whether the coalition structure core is not empty.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the statement below, we refer to the complexity class {a mathematical formula}Σ2P consisting of all the decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine using NP oracles with unitary cost.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, it must be observed that our results are independent of the specific representation scheme used (provided that payoff functions are computable in polynomial time), while being specific for interaction graphs that are lines and cycles.</a>
