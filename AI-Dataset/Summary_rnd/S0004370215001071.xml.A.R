<a href="#0" id="0">Consider two extension-based semantics, σ and τ, for which there are afs F in which {a mathematical formula}σ(F)≠τ(F).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To this end, we have to find common properties for {a mathematical formula}σ(F) which hold for any afF.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">So let {a mathematical formula}S={S1,S2} with {a mathematical formula}S1≠S2 and w.l.o.g.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally we show that σ-realizability has the property {a mathematical formula}AND2, i.e. the problem of deciding whether two instances of the σ-realizability problem are both true can be reduced to a single instance, and then apply a result from Chang and Kadin [15] to deduce {a mathematical formula}DP-hardness.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, {a mathematical formula}E∈S.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As an example, consider {a mathematical formula}T={{a1,b2,b3}, {a mathematical formula}{a2,b1,b3}, {a mathematical formula}{a3,b1,b2}, {a mathematical formula}{b1,b2,b3}}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Theorem 2).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">So if φ is unsatisfiable we again have {a mathematical formula}com(Fφ′)={∅} and thus the extension-set is adm-realizable.</a>
