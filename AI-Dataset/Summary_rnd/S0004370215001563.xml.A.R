<a href="#0" id="0">Such a frontier is denoted by {a mathematical formula}Frontier(Ω,τ,s0,v0) and defines the open pairs for the current Ω stored in Open.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this experiment, we used only planner {a mathematical formula}LPG, since it is the only considered incorporated planner that supports plan adaptation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consequently, after the plan is executed (walk is not affected by the fuel level), the domain can be in two possible states, i.e., either {a mathematical formula}{MyLoc(dept),CarLoc(lot),Fuel(full)} or {a mathematical formula}{MyLoc(dept),CarLoc(lot),Fuel(low)}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We think that the (not surprising) poor performance of NuGaT is merely due to the lack of heuristic-based search techniques (for plan construction) in this general purpose reasoning system.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, we define:{a mathematical formula} where:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We consider both maintenance and achievement goals stated as conjunctions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(Under the closed world assumption, a proposition p is true in s if {a mathematical formula}p∈s, while it is false in s if {a mathematical formula}p∉s, assuming s formalized as a set of propositions.)</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Suppose, on the contrary, that this is not the case and {a mathematical formula}last∉Wn.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We expect these advanced techniques will be helpful especially for programs over planning domains where our current technique can incur in a high number of backtracks.</a>
