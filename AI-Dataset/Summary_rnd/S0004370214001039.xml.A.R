<a href="#0" id="0">The problems{a mathematical formula}Sat(RCC8c,RCP+(R2))and{a mathematical formula}Sat(RCC8c,RC+(R2))coincide and areNP-complete.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Separation results with connectedness constraints</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In that case, these regions will be bounded elements of {a mathematical formula}RCP+(Rn), as required.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We consider first satisfiability over {a mathematical formula}RCP+(R2).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Section 5, we show that {a mathematical formula}RCC8c and {a mathematical formula}RCC8c∘ are sensitive to dimension n in the range {a mathematical formula}1≤n≤3; we further show that these languages are sensitive to the difference between {a mathematical formula}RC+(R) and {a mathematical formula}RCP+(R), that {a mathematical formula}RCC8c∘ is sensitive to the difference between {a mathematical formula}RC+(R2) and {a mathematical formula}RCP+(R2), but that {a mathematical formula}RCC8c is insensitive to the difference between {a mathematical formula}RC+(R2) and {a mathematical formula}RCP+(R2).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If v is of colour {a mathematical formula}p3, then we define {a mathematical formula}suv as before, but extend {a mathematical formula}tuv to some point inside {a mathematical formula}p3 after {a mathematical formula}q2, and take v to be in {a mathematical formula}p3 as well.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let the Boolean subalgebra of {a mathematical formula}RC(Rn) (finitely) generated by the half-spaces be denoted by {a mathematical formula}RCP(Rn), and write {a mathematical formula}RCP+(Rn) as an abbreviation for {a mathematical formula}RCP(Rn)∖{∅}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">(The idea of the construction is similar to the one used to prove NP-hardness of Allen's interval calculus [38].)</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider the two closed subsets of {a mathematical formula}R2 depicted in Fig. 5.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this article, we investigated the widely studied qualitative spatial representation language known as {a mathematical formula}RCC8.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, we can easily satisfy (5) over any {a mathematical formula}RCP+(Rn) for {a mathematical formula}n≥2 (see Fig. 4a).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">That is: f is a realization of {a mathematical formula}GΦ,τ¯.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Whitney's theorem (see [30, p.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We mention in this connection that some authors allow {a mathematical formula}RCC8-constraints to feature sets of the basic {a mathematical formula}RCC8-relations of Fig. 1, interpreted disjunctively.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The following result uses the construction originally devised by Kratochvíl and Matoušek [31] to establish Proposition 2.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Every element of {a mathematical formula}D is a non-empty, regular closed subset of {a mathematical formula}R2; thus, {a mathematical formula}D is a frame over {a mathematical formula}R2.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Using Lemma 9, we write {a mathematical formula}RCC8c∘-constraints whose only satisfying assignments strongly embed the plane graph in Fig. 24.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The relations denoted by these predicates are illustrated, for closed discs in the plane, in Fig. 1.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Let{a mathematical formula}Lbe either of{a mathematical formula}RCC8cor{a mathematical formula}RCC8c∘.</a>
