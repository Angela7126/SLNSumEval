<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast, in Definition 6, Definition 7, it was used to denote a set of arguments and attacks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Rather, as shown by the following proposition, the extensions of the AFN are equivalent to the corresponding extensions of the ASAF after filtering out attacks and supports.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, again, this representation would not be correct since, together with the support {a mathematical formula}LO⟹RI, it would imply that both {a mathematical formula}LO and {a mathematical formula}OLR have to be accepted in order for {a mathematical formula}RI to be accepted.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">S is a complete extension of Γ iff it is admissible and {a mathematical formula}∀X∈(A∪R), if X is acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">□</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is the case of the set {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,β,γ,ω,θ,μ} illustrated in Example 5, which includes every argument and support of the ASAF{a mathematical formula}Δ1 but none of its attacks.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{sup:10}</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Specifically, the ASAF extends the AF by incorporating a necessary support relation and allowing for attacks and supports between arguments, as well as attacks and supports from an argument to the attack and support relations, at any level.</a>
