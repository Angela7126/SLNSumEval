<a href="#0" id="0">Thus, we only allow movements from and to maze zone squares, without loosing admissibility.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The best heuristic for Sokoban was proposed by Junghanns and Schaeffer [16].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the construction of the PDB needs more than one hour or more than 32 GB, the instance is considered unsolvable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this case, we can sum up the distance of each abstract state and get an admissible heuristic value.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To be comparable, all three heuristics were implemented using the same basic algorithms and data structures.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, the more complex computation of the lower bound does not lead to a higher cost per node, and IPDB processes more nodes per second than EMM.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">For the second subproblem any heuristic can be used.</a>
