<a href="#0" id="0">Our final CSP scenario PROTEUS comes from [46] and includes an extremely diverse mix of well-known CSP solvers alongside competition-winning SAT solvers that have to solve (converted) XCSP instances.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The MaxSAT problem representation can be used to effectively encode a number of real-world problems, such as FPGA routing [115], and software package installation [6], among others, as it permits reasoning about both optimality and feasibility.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, the newest systems and results can always be added on-the-fly such that the on-going evaluation always reflects the most recent known state-of-the-art systems and their performances.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Support Vector Machines perform linear classification in a transformed feature space by maximizing the margin between the positive and negative examples.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is fortunate, because such problems are ubiquitous in Artificial Intelligence applications.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Learning in the context of constraint solving is a technique by which previously unknown constraints that are implied by the problem specification are uncovered during search and subsequently used to speed up the solving process.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">The next step to get unbiased performance comparisons of algorithm selectors is to organize competitions based on ASlib.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We used this partition in our study.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">There are many ways of tackling per-instance algorithm selection and related problems.</a>
