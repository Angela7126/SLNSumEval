<a href="#0" id="0">By incorporating other factors such as average margin and variance, we present another generalization error bound which is heavily related to the whole margin distribution.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, Breiman cast serious doubt on margin theory.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the minimum margin{a mathematical formula}θ1=yˆ1f(xˆ1)>0, then, for any{a mathematical formula}δ>0, with probability at least{a mathematical formula}1−δover the random choice of sample S with size{a mathematical formula}m⩾5, every voting classifier{a mathematical formula}f∈C(H)satisfies the following bound:{a mathematical formula}where{a mathematical formula}μ1=144lnmln(2|H|)/θ12+ln(2|H|/δ), μ and{a mathematical formula}Iˆ(θ)are given inTheorem 9.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For an example {a mathematical formula}(x,y), the margin with respect to the voting classifier {a mathematical formula}f=∑αihi(x) is defined as {a mathematical formula}yf(x); in other words,{a mathematical formula} which shows the difference between the weights of base learners that classify {a mathematical formula}(x,y) correctly and the weights of base learners that misclassify {a mathematical formula}(x,y).</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">Then, for any{a mathematical formula}ϵ>0, we have{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">(17), (19), (21) and (22), we have that with probability at least {a mathematical formula}1−δN over the sample S, for all {a mathematical formula}f∈C(H), all {a mathematical formula}θ>α, all {a mathematical formula}k∈[m] but fixed N:{a mathematical formula} To obtain the probability of failure for any N at most δ, we select {a mathematical formula}δN=δ/2N.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">Let {a mathematical formula}X and {a mathematical formula}Y denote an input space and output space, respectively.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">(2), the minimum margin can also be expressed as taking the infimum over all margin, whereas it is well accepted that the minimum margin bound is a single-margin bound.</a>
