<a href="#0" id="0">Profiles act as multicriteria boundaries of categories used to make preference-based assignments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">At this stage, for any {a mathematical formula}λ∈[lA,uA], both statements {a mathematical formula}(1A0,(λ,…,λ)) and {a mathematical formula}((λ,…,λ),1A0) are compatible with the known part of preferences.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This linear program includes at most {a mathematical formula}2n−1 variables (one per element of {a mathematical formula}A(x,y)) and only a quadratic number of monotonicity constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is important to note that, although {a mathematical formula}Cv(a) is a non-linear function of a for fixed v (e.g. {a mathematical formula}Cv(a+b)≠Cv(a)+Cv(b) in general), {a mathematical formula}Cv(a) is linear in v for fixed a (since the permutation of {a mathematical formula}{1,…,n} is also fixed).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Discussion and conclusions</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Within this graph, the arcs corresponding to Equations (18), (19) form two paths characterized by the following lists of nodes: {a mathematical formula}Px=(X(1),…,X(n)) and {a mathematical formula}Py=(Y(1),…,Y(n)).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This important feature can be explained as follows: let {a mathematical formula}[lA,uA] be the range of admissible values for {a mathematical formula}v(A) at a given step of the elicitation procedure (resulting from {a mathematical formula}P).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It would be possible to learn or approximate thresholds in the same time as capacity values which would possibly provide greater flexibility to describe an assignment (but would prevent us to use thresholds prescribed by the DM).</a>
