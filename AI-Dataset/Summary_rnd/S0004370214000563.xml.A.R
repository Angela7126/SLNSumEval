<a href="#0" id="0">Hence, if k goes to infinity, the ratio of the more intuitive flexibilities of {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 goes to infinity as well:{a mathematical formula} while their ratio according to {a mathematical formula}flexN is exactly 1:{a mathematical formula} We conclude that in this case, due to dependencies between events, the {a mathematical formula}flexN metric seriously overestimates the flexibility of STNs such as {a mathematical formula}S2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So consider an arbitrary constraint {a mathematical formula}t−t′≤c∈Ci.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This means that for every agent {a mathematical formula}Ai we have to find an STN {a mathematical formula}Si=(Ti∪{z},Ci′) such that the merge {a mathematical formula}σ=⋃i=1kσi of these individual schedules always constitutes a valid total schedule σ for S.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider the STN {a mathematical formula}S2 presented in Example 1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Typically, each such actor would like to schedule its events independently of the others.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The first reason for this is the limited preservability of fixed-time schedules as assignments determined off-line prior to execution.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For {a mathematical formula}S1, {a mathematical formula}flex(ti)=[0,5] for {a mathematical formula}i=1,2,3.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Moreover, for each individual t, {a mathematical formula}flexN(t) gives an exact measure of the flexibility in scheduling event t, since by decomposability (Proposition 1), for every choice of a value {a mathematical formula}v∈[est(t),lst(t)] there exists a schedule σ for S such that {a mathematical formula}σ(t)=v.</a>
