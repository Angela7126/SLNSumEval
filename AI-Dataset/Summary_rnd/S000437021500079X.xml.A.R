<a href="#0" id="0">The first one is an offline learning phase, which generates two classification models.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Remarkably, the planners selected for gop-1 are the same ones as those picked in the configuration of fdss-1 except for bjolp.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The authors also provide results of the computational advantage of the portfolio approach on hard combinatorial search and reasoning problems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, all participant planners for the IPC-2011 had available all domains of the IPC-2008.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our results show that not all problems provide the same information, termed utility here, and that portfolios configured with small training data sets can perform very well.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If a participant planner p did not solve an instance t, the plan quality of this task was set to zero.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This metric is then used to compute the best portfolio with respect to the selected combination of parameters and performance criteria.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The number of solutions generated by each planner is different.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We propose to split the training problems in subsets that contain those training instances that are solved by a maximum number of solvers.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As it can be seen, the diversity of the candidate time values for each candidate solver has a strong impact on the efficiency of the model.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We considered 1200 instances (application, crafted and random) and 54 participant solvers (including parallel solvers and portfolios in the set of candidate solvers) from that competition.</a>
