<a href="#1" id="1">In the CCDV problem for R we are given an election {a mathematical formula}(C,V), a candidate {a mathematical formula}p∈C, and a nonnegative integer K. We ask whether there is a collection {a mathematical formula}V′ of voters that can be obtained from V be deleting at most K voters such that p is a winner of R election {a mathematical formula}(C,V′).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Yet it is easy to verify that for each positive integer t, {a mathematical formula}(C,A,V,p,K) is a yes instance of CCAC for t-approval if and only if {a mathematical formula}(C,A,V∪Vq′,p,K) is a yes instance of the same problem, where {a mathematical formula}Vq′ is a collection of q blocks of votes that each contain the following {a mathematical formula}3k+2 votes:</a>
