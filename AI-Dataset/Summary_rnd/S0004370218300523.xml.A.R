<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}VK|H={Tα|α∈K}∪{SM|M∈MI(K)}∪{I,HP,HQ}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Allowing for this, we define the following base-level measure for inconsistency in the presence of a hard constraint firstly.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When there is no constraint, the drastic measure {a mathematical formula}MIVD is too simple as compared with either {a mathematical formula}MIVC or {a mathematical formula}MIV♯ to distinguish any two formulas involved in the inconsistency.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If R is a smallest minimal Y-dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK such that {a mathematical formula}R∩P=∅ and {a mathematical formula}Q⊆R, then R is also a smallest minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|Q-dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK|H.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, causality is a subtle topic in itself.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let {a mathematical formula}UK={Uα|α∈K}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Necessity.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In particular, both our base-level and formula-level measures can be reduced to their respective corresponding measures presented in [21] when there is no constraint.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Suppose that {a mathematical formula}H=(P,Q) and {a mathematical formula}H′=(P′,Q′).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">So, {a mathematical formula}R′=⋃M∈MI(K){αi|σαi∈σM∩σR} is a correction subset of K. Then {a mathematical formula}Idr(K)≤Idr(σK).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let K be a knowledge base and{a mathematical formula}Cand{a mathematical formula}C′two soft constraints for K such that{a mathematical formula}C⊆C′.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We define the following functions:</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Then it is also a standard measure.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">According to this definition, the degree of responsibility of any free formula for the inconsistency is 0.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">B winning.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">So,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Free Formula Independence*: {a mathematical formula}I(K|H,C)=I(K∖{α}|H,C) if α is a free formula of K.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In Section 2, we introduce some necessary notions about the inconsistency in knowledge bases, the notion of bipartite graph, Halpern and Pearl's causal model and Chockler and Halpern's notion of responsibility, respectively.</a>
