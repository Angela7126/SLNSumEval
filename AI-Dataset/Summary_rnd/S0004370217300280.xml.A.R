<a href="#0" id="0">If for every{a mathematical formula}(l,G)∈D, there is no{a mathematical formula}(l′,G′)∈Ssuch that the fluent in l occurs in{a mathematical formula}G′, then{a mathematical formula}(s,s′)is a transition of T iff {a mathematical formula}s′=(s∖s−)∪s+, {a mathematical formula}s+∩s−=∅, and both s and{a mathematical formula}s′satisfy the static causal rules in S (Property 1),</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the last section, we described a translation from our causal action theories to causal theories in action language {a mathematical formula}B. Given a causal action theory T, let {a mathematical formula}TB denote the causal theory in {a mathematical formula}B according to this translation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Next we list some reasonable properties that we expect the semantics of the causal action theories to satisfy in Section 3.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">(Poss(A,s)⊃(Holds(G,s)⊃Caused(f,false,do(A,s)))).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">There does not exist a permissible mapping ξ such that it satisfiesProperty 1, Property 2, Property 3, Property 4, Property 5.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Under these choice rules, and given that there is no other rule about f or ¬f in a permissible mapping, fluent literals “f” and “{a mathematical formula}not ¬f” are interchangeable, and so are “¬f” and “{a mathematical formula}not f”.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These different approaches basically all agree when the set of causal rules is stratified, and in this case yields a complete action theory that can be represented, for example, by a set of successor state axioms.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Or we can do it the other way around, use {a mathematical formula}open to mean that the switch is open and represent {a mathematical formula}closed by {a mathematical formula}¬open.</a>
