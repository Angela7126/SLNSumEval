<a href="#0" id="0">We can also check whether S is a stable extension.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The authority may therefore build an argumentation framework representing the evolution of the negotiation process and may help agents to overcome critical situations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To cope with this, in the OSCAR implementation described in [74], Pollock restricts the use of the temporal projection principle to a specific form of backward reasoning: the agent is interested in the value of a property at a specific time instant t and checks whether there are reasons to believe that the property had a certain value at an instant {a mathematical formula}t0<t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}a=b/KΣ (Fact 2.5.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For this purpose we introduce the concept of attack expressions over a finite alphabet Σ. A well-formed attack expression (ae) over Σ is a sentence constructed by the following rules.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In a similar (and simpler) way, since C is attacked only by B we obtain the subexpression {a mathematical formula}tl(I∩C)⋅B, while D has exactly the same attackers as B, yielding {a mathematical formula}tl(I∩D)⋅L3.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The conclusion then follows from the fact that verifying the emptiness of the language generated by a context-free grammar can be done in polynomial time [57].</a>
