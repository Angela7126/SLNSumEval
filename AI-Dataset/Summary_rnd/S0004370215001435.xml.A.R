<a href="#0" id="0">Rules for redundant constraints</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is not surprising because (1) there are typically much more high utility itemsets than there are discriminative ones, and (2) the remaining constraints for the high-utility strategy are computationally harder to verify since they include calculating the cover set of the itemset, whereas the other case only requires computing a simple cost function.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The two key building blocks of the MiningZinc library are the cover and cover_inv functions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Experiments were executed on Linux computers with quad-core Intel i7 processors.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Developing and implementing the algorithms is labor intensive with only limited re-use of software.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When Cθ is the set of constraints subsumed by the algorithm, the set {a mathematical formula}CM\Cθ contains all remaining constraints; if among these remaining constraints there are constraints that rely on the functionally defined by variables that are not in the mode definition of the algorithm, we can remove all constraints except the functional definition constraints necessary to calculate these variables.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The difference with our approach is that we must make a distinction between rewriting the model (e.g. adding redundant constraints) and using specialized algorithms to solve some of the constraints.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The threshold Freq is often called the minimum frequency threshold.</a>
