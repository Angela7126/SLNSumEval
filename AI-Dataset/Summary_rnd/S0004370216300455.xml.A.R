<a href="#3" id="3">The approaches of Gelfond [13], [14] are said to suffer from the problem with recursion through M because they yield for the logic program {a mathematical formula}Π={p←Mp} two world views, viz.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We can also formulate the above problem without using strong negation by rewriting {a mathematical formula}Π2 with ¬ replaced by not, and ∼ by ¬; thus {a mathematical formula}r4 is rewritten as{a mathematical formula} This rule directly expresses that a student should be interviewed if we can neither prove s/he is eligible nor not eligible.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The following result shows that EFLP answer sets of Π are models of Π.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">a guess Φ, {a mathematical formula}¬notL will be either treated ¬⊤ (when {a mathematical formula}notL∈Φ), which evaluates to false, or treated {a mathematical formula}¬¬L (when {a mathematical formula}notF∈Ep(Π)∖Φ), which evaluates to L. This means that our definition of the program transformation would never incur epistemic circular justifications and thus guarantees that world views based on the epistemic reducts will be free of the problem with recursion through K.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">This means {a mathematical formula}I′≠I.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Any subset of the Herbrand base is a Herbrand interpretation of Π.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">So it suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}A={I} is a world view of Π iff I is a standard answer set of {a mathematical formula}Π¬.We first show that {a mathematical formula}A={I} is a candidate world view of Π iff I is a standard answer set of {a mathematical formula}Π¬.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As indicated in the end of Lifschitz [20], “MKNF does not cover the important concept of strong introspection introduced in Gelfond [13].” Thus, applying it to handle epistemic negation would yield unintuitive results.</a>
