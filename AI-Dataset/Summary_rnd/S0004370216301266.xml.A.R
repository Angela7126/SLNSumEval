<a href="#0" id="0">This idea epitomizes the spirit of ad hoc teamwork.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Results for three sizes of worlds are given in Fig. 7.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Q is an estimate of the optimal value function, {a mathematical formula}Q⁎, and this estimate is iteratively improved by looping over the stored samples.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">On the other hand, the PLASTIC-Policy line shows fast improvement, converging to the performance of the Correct Policy line.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">UCT is used due to its speed and ability to handle large action and state spaces, allowing it to scale to large numbers of teammates in complex domains.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This article includes material originally presented in 4 conference papers: [11], [12], [13], [14].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, they assume that the agents share a communication protocol that they use to bid on different roles in an auction as well as a shared coordination protocol for how to assign tasks given this communication.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Other bandit algorithms were tested as were other values of ϵ, but ϵ-greedy with {a mathematical formula}ϵ=0.1 linearly decreasing to 0 over the length of the trial outperformed these other methods.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this work, we find that TwoStageTransfer outperforms the other algorithms tested due to the fact that it is designed to transfer knowledge from multiple data sources simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Using these observations, PLASTIC-Policy can learn a policy for cooperating with its teammates using existing learning algorithms.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Alternatively, TaskTrAdaBoost employs a parameter-transfer approach where it is assumed that the target data shares some parameters with some of the source data sets.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms such as Upper Confidence Bounds for Tree (UCT) [51] approximately calculate the actions that maximize rewards using sampling.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For this related work in ad hoc teamwork, it may be helpful or informative to consider where these problems fall on the dimensions described in Sections 2.1.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The only filtering of this set was removing one student team for never capturing the prey and a second for taking excessively long computation time.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Note that this is significantly less than the testing time of 500 steps, but once testing begins, PLASTIC-Model is not learning online other than adapting its belief distribution over the possible models.</a>
