<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, the graph {a mathematical formula}Gˆ(atom(Πnd),Πnd) can be partitioned into the sets {a mathematical formula}C1,…,Ck of its maximal strongly connected components and organized into {a mathematical formula}m⩾1 levels, such that if there is an arc from a node in a strongly connected component {a mathematical formula}Ci to a node in a strongly connected component {a mathematical formula}Cj, then the level of {a mathematical formula}Ci precedes the level of {a mathematical formula}Cj.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, the system dlv looks for HCF fragments in general disjunctive logic programs to be processed in order to improve efficiency [25], [23].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">m by the well-known unit propagation procedure [11]; (ii) checking if a set of atoms is a model (line 5) which can be accomplished in linear time in m as well; (iii) applying the eliminating operator (line 8), whose cost is {a mathematical formula}Cξ.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, as also proven in [14], the following proposition holds.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, it is sensible to study the behavior of {a mathematical formula}GEA(ξHEF) as applied to a general CNF theory, which is the subject of this section.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given a CNF theory Π, if ϕ belongs to the (unique) minimal model of{a mathematical formula}Π+then Π is inconsistent, otherwise the set of minimal models of Π and{a mathematical formula}Π+coincide.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As for the classes of CNF theories, other than the general one here we consider HEF and HCF theories:</a>
