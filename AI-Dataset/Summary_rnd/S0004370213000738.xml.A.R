<a href="#0" id="0">The average-case complexity can be polynomial in the number of objectives [12].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the other hand, both variants with approximated hypervolume finished all 50,000 objective functions evaluations in less than 10 hours, while the exact version needed more than 10 hours for only the first 5000 objective function evaluations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To this end, we deploy all three indicators in the steady-state variant of the multi-objective covariance matrix evolution strategy (MO-CMA-ES, [27], [34], [37]).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is unavoidable for a probably approximately correct approximation, but undesirable for a practical optimization algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While there exist comparisons of approximation-based algorithms with other MOEAs [2], the effects of replacing the exact hypervolume calculation with an approximation algorithm on the overall performance of MOEAs have not been investigated in isolation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As expected, the hypervolume as a function of the number of objective function evaluations behaves similarly.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, here we want to compare a standard MOEA with and without hypervolume approximation to study the effects of the approximation.</a>
