<a href="#0" id="0">Largest Fit puts this into column 2 giving the score vector {a mathematical formula}〈5,6,5,6〉.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our results about the complexity of manipulating Baldwin's and Nanson's rules significantly increase the size of the set of voting rules used in practice that are known to be NP-hard to manipulate with a single manipulator.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The candidate with the highest total Borda score wins.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In both models, we generated between 2{sup:2} and 2{sup:7} votes for varying m.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our next methods are designed to take into account the elimination style nature of Baldwin's and Nanson's rules.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">With one manipulator, this gives the score vector {a mathematical formula}〈3,6,6,3〉.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It is an interesting question then if such manipulation problems remain polynomial when we drop the domain restriction.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">An edge {a mathematical formula}(Vi,Wj) therefore means that score i can be taken from the jth column of A.Note that there can be multiple edges between any pair of vertices.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus the manipulators can make p win if a perfect partition exists.Conversely, suppose there is a manipulation in which p wins.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Hence, the sum of the diagonal {a mathematical formula}di labelled with k encodes the number of occurrences of gaps of size k. For example, {a mathematical formula}d3=2 ensures that there are two gaps of size 2 and {a mathematical formula}d5=2 ensures that there are two gaps of size 4.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this section we show that weighted coalitional manipulation under Baldwin's or Nanson's rules is NP-complete.</a>
