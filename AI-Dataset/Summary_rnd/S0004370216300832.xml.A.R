<a href="#0" id="0">The processing technique in [1] is similar to the one in [22], but it is used dynamically during the search process.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In local search algorithms for SAT and MaxSAT, a variable is said to be decreasing (which means its flip would decrease the cost of the assignment) if its score is positive, and increasing if its score is negative.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Structure of the paper</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, for industrial PMS instances, although Dist significantly outperforms other local search solvers, its performance is still unsatisfactory, and there is an obvious gap between the performance of Dist and state-of-the-art complete solvers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Among the 421 instances, Dist finds the best solution for 378 of them, while this number is 293, 282 and 287 for CCLS, CCMPA and TWO-LEVEL respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let y denote the corresponding variable of p. If neither literal p nor literal ¬p is in Q (i.e., {a mathematical formula}polarity_in_Q(y)=−1), then p is enqueued into Q, and {a mathematical formula}polarity_in_Q(y) is set to {a mathematical formula}polarity(p).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The scenario that the search faces varies considerably, and we divide them into three situations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this work, we utilized a powerful automatic configuration tool called SMAC (Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration) [30] to tune the parameter settings for our Dist algorithm.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In Q, hard unit clauses have higher priority than soft ones.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Related work PMS (as a generalization of MaxSAT) is an NP-hard problem.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For industrial benchmark: {a mathematical formula}t=42, {a mathematical formula}wp=0.091, {a mathematical formula}sp=0.00003.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Whenever finding a feasible assignment with a lower cost, the algorithm records it as the best found assignment.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">After that, we propose the PrioUP procedure, and apply it to improve Dist in Section 6, where we also present experiments on the improved algorithm DistUP and a discussion on the initialization procedure.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For the industrial benchmarks, we also include the complete solver Eva500 in our experiments.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Intuitively, because hard clauses are compelled to be satisfied, the factor A should be set very large (as an extreme case, A is set to the number of soft clauses plus one).</a>
