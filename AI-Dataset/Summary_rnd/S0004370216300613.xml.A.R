<a href="#0" id="0">Previous approaches to NERC combining clusters or word embeddings have obtained mixed results [60].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, it contains nested entities so the evaluation results will be provided in terms of the outer and the inner spans of the named entities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Section 4.2 analyzes the performance when reducing training data and Section 4.3 presents eight out-of-domain evaluations for three languages: Dutch, English and Spanish.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Mentions including the definite article within the name entity span: ‘the United States’ versus ‘United States’.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Traditionally, local features have included contextual and orthographic information, affixes, character-based features, prediction history, etc.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In contrast, trigrams and character n-grams were highly beneficial in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings for Basque and German.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Details of each dataset can be found Table 1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In Basque the only gold standard corpus is Egunkaria [4].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, taking into account our baseline system, we will add the following Brown clustering features:</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">So far the most successful approaches have only used one type of word representation [48], [23], [52].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For example, we would have been interested in training the Stanford NER system with the full Ancora corpus for the evaluation presented in Table 16, but their Spanish cluster lexicon is not available.</a>
