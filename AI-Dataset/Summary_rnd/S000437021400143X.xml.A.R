<a href="#0" id="0">Operations on the set maintain such a permutation by swapping elements in and out of S. Because both arrays dense and sparse are initially filled with values from 1 to n, there must be only a single copy of each value in dense at any time.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Fig. 16 depicts with a first scatter plot the results obtained with STR2 and STR3 (within MAC) on the full set of 2005 instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The pseudocode for the propagation portion of GAC4 is given by Fig. 13.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We introduce two stacks, denoted by stackS (S stands for Separator) and stackI (I stands for Invalid), that allow us to store values of the form {a mathematical formula}table(C,X,a).sep and {a mathematical formula}inv(C).members at different levels of search.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Now, consider {a mathematical formula}dep(C,k) and {a mathematical formula}dep(C,kâ€²) after backtrack.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We now consider in details different circumstances during STR3's execution when the validity of these two tuples later change (not including the cases where STR3 reports inconsistency).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Interestingly, the advantage of STR2 appears to depend largely on excessively high rates of table reduction (very low avgP).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We can now define Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC) as follows.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">STR3 takes a lazy approach by partitioning a support list into two contiguous parts: an explored region known not to have any valid support, and an unexplored region.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">There are two possible choices after this state:</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A first observation is that STR3 requires on average up to two times more memory than STR2; more memory was expected, but this is much better than what worst-case complexity suggests.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Throughout this paper and especially in the experiments section, when we refer to STR2 we mean STR2+.</a>
