<a href="#0" id="0">This paper addresses function problems defined on propositional formulae, which are defined in Section 3.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}M be a minimal set such that {a mathematical formula}P(M) holds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Reduction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Longest Extension of Implicate; FLEIcLet c be an implicate of {a mathematical formula}F∈C, i.e. {a mathematical formula}F⊨c.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}M∈ML(R)if and only if{a mathematical formula}Mis an irreducible hitting set of{a mathematical formula}MP(R) {a mathematical formula}U∈MP(R)if and only if{a mathematical formula}Uis an irreducible hitting set of{a mathematical formula}ML(R)</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}FMCFS≤pMSMP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}F={(x1∨x2),(x1∨¬x2),(x1),(¬x1)}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Suppose there is one {a mathematical formula}l∈tk such that {a mathematical formula}l∉q, then we would have {a mathematical formula}F⊨(F∖{tk})∨(q∧l), thus contradicting the minimality of {a mathematical formula}M (maximality of q).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Second, the paper identifies a large number of function problems that can be reduced to MSMP, and details one or more reductions in each case.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A minimal set {a mathematical formula}M⊆R over P corresponds to a maximal set {a mathematical formula}R∖M, containing all the constraints {a mathematical formula}(∑pi∈Ppi≥bj) which is all-falsifiable.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}FSMCS≤pMSMP.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In recent years, the most widely used approach for solving a comprehensive range of function problems defined on Boolean formulae consists of using the SAT solver as an oracle, which is called a number of times polynomial in the size of the problem representation.</a>
