<a href="#1" id="1">We next formalise a scheme for reasoning with witness testimonies and its undercutter as follows:{a mathematical formula} We apply these schemes to the imaginary case of John, a suspect in a robbery in Holland Park, London.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula} Consider the Keeble case again.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An example is n1: Xsells derivativeYtoZinitiatesO(Xpays â‚¬100 tax)</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Another area in which rule-based systems have proved useful is regulatory compliance.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Bex's hybrid model was developed on the assumption that lawyers would find the need to explain testimonies (and other sources of evidence) less natural than regarding them as information sources from which defeasible inferences can be drawn.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A legal case has various aspects, each with its own modes of reasoning: determining the facts, classifying the facts under legal concepts or conditions, and deriving legal consequences from the thus classified facts.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus a legal knowledge base always grows with the addition of new norms, the termination of the validity of a norm determining the inapplicability of that norm to subsequent cases (for a similar approach, see [180]).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, other presumptions have economic or other policy reasons.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">They can be found in their most explicit form in common-law jurisdictions, in which judicial precedents can be legally binding beyond the decided case, so that court decisions legally constrain the decision in new cases.</a>
