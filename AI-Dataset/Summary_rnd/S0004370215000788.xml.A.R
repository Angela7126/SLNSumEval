<a href="#2" id="2">Let us try to model auction design as an MDP.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As can be seen in the right plot, the difference between the white-box and black-box methods are negligible for these small instances.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Extensive experiments are presented in Section 5 where we compare the performance of the two proposed optimization methods using both the learned models and the auction simulator.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By additionally requiring that exactly one z variable is true at every index, we fully encode the learned regression trees.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The {a mathematical formula}R2-scores obtained in these experiments are shown in Fig. 11.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For each set of experiment, we generate a set of agents, and generate and run new sets of items 5 times.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Later, the same principle was used to model the dependencies among textual tokens in text-based documents for entity recognition by Fersini et al. [45].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For example, given types {a mathematical formula}r1 and {a mathematical formula}r2 with quantities of 1 and 2 respectively, there are three possible orderings of items: {a mathematical formula}(s1=r1,s2=r2,s3=r2), {a mathematical formula}(s1=r2,s2=r1,s3=r2), and {a mathematical formula}(s1=r2,s2=r2,s3=r1).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Our approach can thus be applied to complex optimization settings where entire orders, schedules, or plans need to be constructed beforehand.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In [34], the authors build a mixed integer program for multi-class data classification.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">An overview of this process is given in Fig. 3.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Empirical research has been conducted to test the theoretical findings in the economics community.</a>
