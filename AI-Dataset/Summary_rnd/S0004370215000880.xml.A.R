<a href="#1" id="1">This follows from the fact that no matter which agents of {a mathematical formula}N1 we assign buffer objects to, the remaining agents are not able to cover {a mathematical formula}O1S with their sets of most preferred objects.</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">It can be verified in time polynomial in n and m whether an assignment is fair for all notions of fairness considered in the paper.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assume an assignment p does not satisfy weak SD proportionality.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It can be checked in polynomial time whether a discrete SD proportional assignment exists even if agents are allowed to express indifference between objects.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Another possible way to circumvent non-existence of SD proportional or weak SD proportional assignments is to define less stringent notions by replacing the reference vector {a mathematical formula}(1n,…,1n) with a reference vector with {a mathematical formula}1/n replaced by some constant.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It can be checked in polynomial time whether a necessary proportional discrete assignment exists even if agents have different entitlements.</a>
