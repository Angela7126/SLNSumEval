<a href="#0" id="0">In China, there was a significant difference in the score of the CS-A agent (Mean = 364.76, SD = 72.4) and people (Mean = 230.66, SD = 106.43), t(30) = 3.80, {a mathematical formula}p<0.0001.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The objectives for all players is to maximize their profits, measured by the amount of resources they are able to collect by the end of the game and whether they can reach the goal.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In contrast, in our study, 68.7% of the HvCS-A games ended with people accepting offers that are significantly more beneficial to the agent than to themselves.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For any path P that does not lead to one of the goals (and if the number of dormant turns d is 1, then {a mathematical formula}P≠∅) one of the following must hold:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One agent, termed “SP-A”, used the strategy that is described in the equilibrium definition in Theorem 1, while assigning probability {a mathematical formula}p=1 for the customer player reaching the goal.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This definition depends on the notion of a preferred path, which due to the recursive nature of our equations we will formalize later, in Definition 5.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">They showed that an agent that used hand-designed rules to make and respond to offers could adapt to the different reliability and generosity measures that were exhibited by people in the different cultures.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The SP-A agent offered 40 chips (33 red chips and 7 purple chips) in return for 11 gray chips.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The definition of {a mathematical formula}P⁎ is recursive.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For the service provider (SP) role, we used one of two types of equilibrium agents.</a>
