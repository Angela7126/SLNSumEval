<a href="#0" id="0">One of the main challenges faced by these learning systems is to collect training instances.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, we predict the average solution cost for the Sliding-Tile puzzles up to the {a mathematical formula}8×8 configuration, which has more than 10{sup:88} reachable states, and provide indirect evidence that BiSS's predictions for these huge state spaces are quite accurate.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, BiSS's worst-case memory requirement is on the order of {a mathematical formula}C⋅|T|.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To address this problem, Jabbari Arfaee et al. suggested a method that interleaves learning heuristics and solving the given target instance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In a preliminary experiment we ran on the ({a mathematical formula}5×5)-Sliding-Tile puzzle (24-puzzle) using the same heuristic function and the same number of probes we use in our experiments below, the predictions produced by this approach were less accurate than the relatively inaccurate Manhattan Distance heuristic.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Increasing p will drive the signed error towards 0, i.e., increase the accuracy of the predictions, until p is large enough that the signed error becomes negative.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In general, we define {a mathematical formula}p(i,t,s⁎,d) as the approximated probability of finding at least one node of type t, in a search tree rooted at state {a mathematical formula}s⁎, at level i, with cost bound d. SCP assumes the variables {a mathematical formula}π(⋅|⋅) to be independent.</a>
