<a href="#1" id="1">For NED/EV after an initial exploration phase, the error shoots down.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Physicists have developed simulation-based probability models of the Universe which can be used to compute the likelihood of cosmological parameters for a given observation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We compare with ABC only in experiments where it is possible to sample from the likelihood (in addition to evaluating the likelihood).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}Xobs denote our observations (e.g. signals from telescopes).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We show that a principled query strategy outperforms this heuristic.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our GP over the log joint probability gives us uncertainty for {a mathematical formula}log⁡P(θ+,Xobs) – depicted by {a mathematical formula}pB,pR,pG in blue, green and red respectively.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note that the KL divergence for BO gets stuck without decreasing further.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A popular choice for the covariance kernel is the squared exponential kernel {a mathematical formula}kσf,h(θ,θ′)=σf2exp⁡(−‖θ−θ′‖2/(2h2)).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this regime, where the cost of the likelihood evaluation is more expensive or comparable to the cost of determining the next point in EV, we significantly outperforms other methods on wall clock time.</a>
