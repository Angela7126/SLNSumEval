<a href="#0" id="0">We may assume that {a mathematical formula}Σ⊭θ (otherwise {a mathematical formula}Σ∈⊨θ follows immediately).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then it follows that {a mathematical formula}X∩Δ=∅.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Clearly, if {a mathematical formula}d≠I″(c), then d satisfies {a mathematical formula}θ(x) in {a mathematical formula}A″ iff d satisfies {a mathematical formula}θ(x) in {a mathematical formula}A, while {a mathematical formula}I″(c) satisfies {a mathematical formula}θ(x) in {a mathematical formula}A″ iff {a mathematical formula}I′(c) satisfies {a mathematical formula}θ(x) in {a mathematical formula}A′.Given that all sentences of {a mathematical formula}Σ∈ are of the form {a mathematical formula}∀xθ(x) with θ as described, {a mathematical formula}A″ will be a model of {a mathematical formula}Σ∈.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To explain the constraint, it is necessary to introduce some technical notions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}〈V,Σ〉 an inheritance network and {a mathematical formula}a∈V.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">There is, in fact, a huge difference between this example and the example in section 3.3.1, which is best brought out by comparing the pictures.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}ϕ=∀x(Pjx∧¬Abϕ→Pkx) for some k, with {a mathematical formula}B′⊨¬Pkc∧¬Abϕc.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}Σ∈⊨ΣWI.We first prove that {a mathematical formula}Σ∈⊨ΣW.</a>
