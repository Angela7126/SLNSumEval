<a href="#1" id="1">More formally, for all {a mathematical formula}V′⊆V(C), we let{a mathematical formula} In order to ensure that we make at most k merges, we need an additional index in the main table T. More precisely, for a set {a mathematical formula}V′⊆V(C) of vertices, let {a mathematical formula}T[V′,k] be the maximum number of parts P with {a mathematical formula}μ(P)≥h in any partition of {a mathematical formula}V′ that can be obtained from the singleton partition by performing at most k merges.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Enumerate all minimal sets P such that P is a clique in the compatibility graph and {a mathematical formula}μ(P)>h.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In comparison, article merging is easy, reversible and usually justified.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, since {a mathematical formula}P does not have H-index h, there is an article {a mathematical formula}u∈U that is a singleton in {a mathematical formula}P and satisfies {a mathematical formula}μ({u})<h.</a>
