<a href="#0" id="0">The 3-ary unbiased black-box complexity of Partition is at most linear in the size {a mathematical formula}|I| of the input set {a mathematical formula}I.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus the objective function in this setting is given as an oracle or as a black-box.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Partition is also one of the few {a mathematical formula}NP-hard problems for which theoretical investigations of randomized search heuristics exist.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While in the unrestricted model any function class consisting of a single function has a black-box complexity of one, in the unbiased model more function evaluations are needed to generate an optimal solution from applying the variation operators.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}RLS(â‹…) is a unary unbiased variation operator.</a>
