<a href="#0" id="0">This observation is formalized in Lemma 1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The cost of this solution is 1, proving that any 3-coloring of the graph in Fig. 4 has to assign the same color to at least one pair of nodes sharing an edge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We say that points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj are similar if {a mathematical formula}W(i,j)∈R and {a mathematical formula}W(i,j)>0.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In [12] the authors experiment with correlation clustering allowing overlapping clusters.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The reason for the absence of the QIP approach from the plot is that neither CPLEX, Gurobi, nor SCIP was able to solve any of the quadratic programs exactly within the time limit.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">At the core of the approach, we present three different MaxSAT formulations of correlation clustering, and provide formal proofs for their correctness.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">There has also been some work done on a variant of correlation clustering in which the search is further restricted to {a mathematical formula}cl:V→{1,…K} for some {a mathematical formula}K<N[8].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">While we do not have a definitive explanation for this poor behavior, one possible explanation may deal with the non-convexity (recall Section 4) of the QIP formulation of correlation clustering.</a>
