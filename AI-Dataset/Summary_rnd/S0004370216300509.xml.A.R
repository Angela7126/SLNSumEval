<a href="#1" id="1">Marginal regression is a relatively old technique that has recently reemerged as a computationally faster alternative to lasso regression [8].</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">When p is much larger than n, marginal regression provides two orders of speedup over Lasso based formulations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We refer the interested reader to [29] for more details.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Some choices for the regularizer are the {a mathematical formula}(p,1)-mixed norms when the dictionary exhibits a natural grouping; tree-structured norms when the dictionary is assumed to be embedded in a tree-structure; hierarchical norms which are typically composition of several norms and graph based norms and random field norms [4], [13].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Though this does not guarantee convergence to a global optimum, according to the experimental results, we see that the points of convergence invariably resulted in a good local optimum as reflected by the good empirical performance.</a>
