<a href="#0" id="0">The upper time limit for refinement (i.e., before resorting to replanning from scratch) is set to half the time of the last planning from scratch invocation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We say that {a mathematical formula}precond(a) holds at s (or alternatively that s satisfies{a mathematical formula}precond(a)) if {a mathematical formula}precond(a) evaluates to true for all possible assignments to values consistent with the domains of the variables at s. This implies for example that given a state {a mathematical formula}s={(v1,{1}),(v2,{1,2})} and an action a which has a precondition {a mathematical formula}v1=v2, a is not applicable at s. As we see in Section 2.2, {a mathematical formula}effects(a) also amount to a conjunction of propositions that should hold at {a mathematical formula}sâ€².</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A direct transformation of the planning problem into a CSP has been presented in [42], where constraints describe the preconditions and effects of actions along with frame axioms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">On the other hand, Goal 2 ensures that {a mathematical formula}bookedConcert=TRUE will be satisfied if the temperature is not below zero, while if it is, then only {a mathematical formula}bookedHotel=TRUE will be looked after.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Dead-ends cannot be avoided, because the planner cannot predict the actual state and the evolution of the environment, and during the orchestration any event and observation may occur.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Act is the set of actions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Many elements of the language are inspired by XSRL (XML Service Request Language) [1], [78] for formulating complex requests against standard business processes.</a>
