<a href="#0" id="0">Since both components are healthy and there are six healthy components, repairing {a mathematical formula}C1 and {a mathematical formula}C2 adds {a mathematical formula}26 to the wasted cost metric.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, diagnoses were returned in order of their cardinality, finding first all minimal cardinality diagnoses, then all subset-minimal diagnoses with cardinality higher than the minimal cardinality by one, and so on.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, these actions often are costly that make it prohibitively expensive to reduce the set of diagnoses to a manageable size.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A new approach to testing has been proposed by Feldman et al. [6] as part of the LYDIA-NG framework for Model-Based Diagnosis.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, to provide further context for the presented quality values, Table 9, Table 10 also contain a special row, marked “Oracle”.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The subsequent diagnoses all have equal probabilities, so assume that they are ordered lexicographically, i.e., the first diagnosis to be repaired is {a mathematical formula}{C3,C4}, then {a mathematical formula}{C3,C5} and so on.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The final contribution of this paper, beyond the previous version, is by performing our experimental analysis over an additional domain of software diagnosis.</a>
