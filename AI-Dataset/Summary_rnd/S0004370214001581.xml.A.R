<a href="#0" id="0">From v's start value, {a mathematical formula}IB[v]=I〚π〛[v], all values {a mathematical formula}d∈DB(v) of v's reduced domain are reachable in {a mathematical formula}DTGΠ(v)|R∪B.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Otherwise,{a mathematical formula}PlanExist(G)is not polynomial-time decidable (unless{a mathematical formula}W[1]⊆nu-FPT).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We finalize the red–black plan by applying {a mathematical formula}a″.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We consider uniform costs throughout, ignoring action costs where specified.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have devised a variety of methods for doing so.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Towards enhancing (b) {a mathematical formula}FDR-executability of the red–black plan, we designed a simple criterion for each of the choice points (i) and (ii).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Clearly, π induces a path from {a mathematical formula}I[v] to {a mathematical formula}I〚π〛[v] in {a mathematical formula}DTGΠ(v)|R∪B.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">That is, we say that an {a mathematical formula}RB task {a mathematical formula}Π=〈VB,VR,A,I,G〉 is reversible if, for every state s reachable from I, there exists an action sequence π so that {a mathematical formula}s〚π〛[VB]=I[VB].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the remaining domains – with ratios on both sides of 1 – we see that the median typically is indicative of whether or not large improvements occur: For median ratios close to 1, the maximum typically is below 3.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}PlanExist(G) and {a mathematical formula}PlanGen(G) are the plan existence and plan generation problems restricted to {a mathematical formula}FDR planning tasks whose causal graphs are elements of {a mathematical formula}G.</a>
