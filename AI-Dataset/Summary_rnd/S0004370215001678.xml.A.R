<a href="#0" id="0">In order to demonstrate the full performance potential of these solvers, we also tuned the parameters for all parameterized challengers using the same configuration procedure and protocol as for SATenstein-LS, including the same choices of discrete values for continuous and integer parameters.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach by automatically constructing high-performance stochastic local search solvers for SAT.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">ParamILS [40], [39] is a model-free method based on iterated local search and with a “challenge incumbent” procedure somewhat akin to racing.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As it is impossible to express the condition {a mathematical formula}A|(B=b)∨(C=c) directly in the input to FocusedILS, we introduce two dummy parameters, {a mathematical formula}A⁎ and {a mathematical formula}D⁎.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) asks, for a given propositional formula F, whether there exists a complete assignment of truth values to the variables of F under which F evaluates to true (see, e.g., [8]).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This indicates that many interesting designs that could compete with existing high-performance solvers still remain unexplored in SLS design space.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Design</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Each run of any solver only used one CPU.</a>
