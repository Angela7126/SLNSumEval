<a href="#0" id="0">As mentioned previously, uniformly raising the value of all rewards by a constant value does not affect the MDP-optimal policy for a continuing task but often will for an episodic task (assuming the value is not raised at an absorbing state).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This article also presents a contribution from a broader perspective.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The grid-world agent</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This model completes an MDP specification for the agent to plan in, {a mathematical formula}{S,A,T,RˆH,γ,D} (Fig. 2).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental condition.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It is also the first algorithm to successfully learn non-myopically from human reward (in the continuing-task experiment of Section 8).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Click on the box below, and Kermit to the water three times.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, in many goal-based tasks, one such simple reward function would output 0 for transitions that reach a goal state and −1 otherwise.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}RˆH is updated with new feedback by incremental gradient descent with a step size of 0.2.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Additionally, we observe that the highest mean performance across all γs in both episodic and continuing tasks is at {a mathematical formula}γ=0.7, outperforming the myopic {a mathematical formula}γ=0 agent by 8.4 time steps per episode; however, this difference—calculated with the continuing-task {a mathematical formula}γ=0 performance, which is slightly higher than the episodic version—is not significant by a Wilcoxon signed-rank test ({a mathematical formula}p=0.246).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">These relationships are examined in six experiments across two domains.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Thus, setting {a mathematical formula}γ=0 effectively reduces reinforcement learning of a value function to supervised learning of a reward function.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This article is organized as follows.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">During these instructions, subjects are told to give “reward and punishment” to the green “Kermitbot” to “teach the robot to find the water as fast as possible.” Trainers were left to determine their own reward strategies, possibly including rewarding every time the agent acts as they would have acted or rewarding highly when the agent reaches the goal.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">These states may have never been experienced by the agent during training, in which case {a mathematical formula}RˆH is built without any samples from the state.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Reward and punishment are frequently received in a social context from another agent.</a>
