<a href="#1" id="1">As such, there are cases in which agents u and v have no incentive to deviate to {a mathematical formula}{u,v}∉M only if two edges {a mathematical formula}e′={v,w} and {a mathematical formula}e″={u,z} are both present in M. Hence, we obtain consistent domination rules {a mathematical formula}({e′,e″},e) with more than one coalition in the precondition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A coalition C is a social blocking coalition if it is a blocking coalition and there is a graph {a mathematical formula}H=(VH,EH)∈H and some bijective map {a mathematical formula}φ:VH→C such that {a mathematical formula}{u,v}∈VH⇒{φ(u),φ(v)}∈L.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Here use the fact that in a star all edges share the same (center) vertex.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A state is core-stable if there is no blocking coalition.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For correlated matching with ties we add two vertices {a mathematical formula}yCj and {a mathematical formula}yCj′ to W and edges {a mathematical formula}{vCj,yCj} and {a mathematical formula}{vCj,yCj′} – both of benefit j – to E for every clause {a mathematical formula}Cj.</a>
