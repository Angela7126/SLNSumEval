<a href="#0" id="0">Offline-learning GBFS is more successful, improving over the GBFS baseline in almost all cases with path-cut refinement.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This question has been previously addressed only in the context of partial delete-relaxation heuristics [66], [67], [73], which extract delete-relaxed plans on top of {a mathematical formula}hC.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Neighbors refinement is clearly best overall, and it consistently dominates on the resource-constrained benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that (a) makes sense despite the fact that s was already tested by (b) when it was first generated.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then{a mathematical formula}uC(s,G)=∞if and only if there exists{a mathematical formula}c∈Csuch that:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As a single call to PathCutRefine only guarantees to increase {a mathematical formula}hC(s) by at least 1, for dead-end refinement we need to iterate these calls, setting {a mathematical formula}C:=C∪X after each call, until {a mathematical formula}hC(s)=∞ holds.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For state space search, conflicts in length-bounded search take the form of states unsolvable within the bound.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From category (a), we run the following algorithms.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">On resource-constrained domains, neighbors refinement is clearly superior, followed by path-cut refinement and the conflict refinement from prior work.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let C be any set of atomic conjunctions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We use the benchmarks by Nakhost et al. [28], which are controlled in that the minimum required budget {a mathematical formula}bmin is known, and the actual budget is set to {a mathematical formula}W⁎bmin, where the constrainedness level W is a benchmark instance parameter.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In the specific case of {a mathematical formula}s4, the learned clause is {a mathematical formula}ϕ=t(l3)∨f(1)∨f(2)∨p1(l3).</a>
