<a href="#1" id="1">With properly decreasing learning rates, dropout is almost sure to converge to a small neighborhood of a local minimum (or global minimum in the case of a strictly convex error function) in a way similar to stochastic gradient descent in standard neural networks [38], [13], [14].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is the case when using independent Bernoulli selector applied to the connections.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, while dropout has already been successfully applied to several real-life problems, many more remain to be tested.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Eq.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The key property behind Eq.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It is known that the logistic function can be approximated by a cumulative Gaussian distribution in the form{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Φμ,σ2(x)=∫−∞x12πσe−t2/2dt for a suitable value of α. Depending on the optimization criterion, different but reasonably close values of α can be found in the literature such as {a mathematical formula}α=0.607[21] or {a mathematical formula}α=1/1.702=0.587[15].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In biological systems, there are many examples, for instance in the visual and motor systems, where information seems to be carried by the short term average firing rate of neurons rather than the exact timing of their spikes.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">First, the logistic function is one of the most important and widely used transfer functions in neural networks.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Furthermore {a mathematical formula}σO2=C1≈C2 if {a mathematical formula}σO2 is small.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The adaptive coefficient{a mathematical formula}Var(α)measures the dropout variance of the contribution to the final output associated with all the input-to-output paths which contain w. The component{a mathematical formula}Cov(α,β)measures the dropout covariance between the contribution associated with all the paths that contain w and the contribution associated with all the paths that do not contain w. In general, this covariance is small and equal to zero for a single layer linear network.</a>
