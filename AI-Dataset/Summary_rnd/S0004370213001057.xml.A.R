<a href="#0" id="0">A comparison between CROSS and {a mathematical formula}CROSS⁎, w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The two approaches differ also for the adopted search strategy, discussed in Section 7.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Before introducing our constraint model it is necessary to get a better insight into the resource usage profile of a periodic schedule.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A set of executions {a mathematical formula}(i,ω) of all the activities in {a mathematical formula}V with the same ω value is referred to as a repetition.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Otherwise, the activity j is scheduled at time t and on backtrack the constraint {a mathematical formula}si>t is posted.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Intuitively the algorithm proceeds as follows: for each unbound activity i the algorithm scans the resource profile, starting from {a mathematical formula}ESTi, to search for a schedulability window.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Cyclic scheduling problems arise in a number of application areas, such as in hoist scheduling [10], mass production [19], [13], flow shop [30], [31], cyclic job-shop [8], [9], compiler design (optimizing loops on parallel architectures) [27], [19], software pipelining [35], and data-flow computing [22].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This could be addressed by exploiting ideas from the Precedence Constrain Posting technique [29], [34], developed for non-cyclic scheduling problems.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since the group of repetitions in the schedule is repeated in a blocked fashion, the unfolding approach may be incapable to optimally exploit inter-repetition overlaps to make the best use of the available resources.</a>
