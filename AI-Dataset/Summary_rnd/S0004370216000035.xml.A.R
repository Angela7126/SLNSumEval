<a href="#0" id="0">Observe that the membership in {a mathematical formula}FPNP[wit,log] does not require the Turing machine to work for an arbitrary NP oracle—it is sufficient to construct a machine for one specific oracle.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is an instance of the MaxSet problem and therefore it belongs to {a mathematical formula}FP∥NP due to Proposition 2 and to {a mathematical formula}FPNP[wit,log] due to Proposition 3.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This technique appears in a very specific form in the context of MCSes and MUSes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Besides the well-known complexity classes P, NP, coNP, {a mathematical formula}Dp, as well as {a mathematical formula}PNP=Δ2p, {a mathematical formula}NPNP=Σ2p, etc., the following classes of decision and function problems are used in the article (see [15] for a definition of function problem):</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Conversely, the predicate for FMCS holds whenever the complement is satisfiable.</a>
