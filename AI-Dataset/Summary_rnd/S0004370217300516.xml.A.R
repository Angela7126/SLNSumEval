<a href="#3" id="3">While coalition structure generation has been classically studied in the literature by assuming that all coalitions are allowed to form, in real-world applications it is often the case that some coalition structures are inadmissible, because they violate a number of constraints induced by the specific semantics of the application at hand (see, e.g., [59]).</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">On the other hand, it is immediate to check that if Π is a clustering, then Π is also a {a mathematical formula}σR-feasible coalition structure, for any set R including precisely one element for each cluster in Π. Hence, an optimal k-clustering can be computed as a coalition structure having the maximum {a mathematical formula}σR-value over all {a mathematical formula}σR-optimal coalition structures for any subset {a mathematical formula}R⊆N with {a mathematical formula}|R|=k.</a>
