<a href="#0" id="0">SemantiKLUE[112] combines a set of different unsupervised and supervised techniques to measure semantic similarity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">WordNet domain-labeled dataset</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Lafon [62] proposed a method to reduce the computation cost of Equation (2).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Sense clustering.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For instance, the following example from the SemEval-2013 Word Sense Disambiguation test set shows a case where our system committed a mistake for the fine-grained sense definition of the target word behaviour.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We constructed a highly competitive unsupervised system on the basis of the Nasari representations, outperforming state-of-the-art supervised systems on two manually-annotated Wikipedia sense clustering datasets [23].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">WN-Domains-3.2 was released for WordNet 2.0.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, we discuss the related work in Section 11 and provide the concluding remarks in Section 12.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The domain labeling task has proven to be useful when integrated into a given lexical resource [127], [70] and has several direct applications, such as Word Sense Disambiguation [71], [3], [30] and Text Categorization [94].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We performed experiments on the 162 noun instances of the SemEval-2007 dataset.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{sup:10} We computed Nasari lexical and unified vectors for English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">When comparing our three systems, the combination of both lexical and unified vectors outperforms both single-handed components.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">However, most VSM-based techniques, whether in their conventional co-occurrence based form [119], [129], [63], or in their newer predictive branch [20], [81], [8], usually base their computation on the distributional statistics derived from text corpora.</a>
