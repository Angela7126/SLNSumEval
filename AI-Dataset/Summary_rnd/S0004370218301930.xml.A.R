<a href="#1" id="1">The simple version of PGG</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When {a mathematical formula}K=1, the proposed method produces outcomes which about 5% higher social welfare improvement than those provided by better-response dynamics (Fig. 7a), which is consistent with the results of the first set of experiments (Fig. 5a).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The present paper shows (in Section 3) that by using a simple distributed search algorithm like best response, the car pool grouping seekers on a social network can within a bounded number of rounds find a stable solution to the problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">According to Equation (23) player 1 can secure a payoff of {a mathematical formula}C to player 2 ({a mathematical formula}τ1,2=C) in order to convince her to remain with her choice T. At this stage {a mathematical formula}τ1(v⁎)=C.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A unilateral deviation of player i will result in outcome {a mathematical formula}v′=(vi=T,v−i⁎), in which i's utility will be {a mathematical formula}ui(v′)=K−Ci.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, it provides an additional incentive to use payoff transfers when {a mathematical formula}K=3 since the decrease in social welfare of better-response dynamics is over 15%.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Stability enforcing algorithm</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Transfers of payoffs are used in order to ensure stability.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We relate to such an outcome as an efficient one.</a>
