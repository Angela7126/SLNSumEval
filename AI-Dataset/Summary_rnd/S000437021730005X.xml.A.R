<a href="#0" id="0">Most work in planning assumes that complete domain models are given as input in order to synthesize plans.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The trucks can be loaded or unloaded with packages (with or without a driver present) and the objective is to transport packages between locations, ending up with a subset of the packages, the trucks and the drivers at specified destinations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, the fit polynomial of ML-CBP for blocks is {a mathematical formula}−0.0008x2+0.9868x−62.4000, whose curve is shown in Fig. 10.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In Fig. 3(c), {a mathematical formula}p1 and {a mathematical formula}p2 are two plan cases with the initial states and goals in brackets.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that objects “A” and “a” are two instances of the same variable, likewise for other objects.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We note that ML-CBP does not check whether the solution is correct with respect to the incomplete model.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">CLAM [33] constructs analogy-driven proof plans and uses derivational analogy to reformulate the source plans for case replay.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given that there might be different mappings between {a mathematical formula}P˜ and {a mathematical formula}pi, we seek for the one maximally mapping {a mathematical formula}pi to {a mathematical formula}P˜, defined as {a mathematical formula}m⁎=arg⁡maxm⁡θ(pi,m).</a>
