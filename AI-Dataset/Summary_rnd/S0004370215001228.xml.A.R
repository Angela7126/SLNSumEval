<a href="#3" id="3">The other side concerns the part of the theory K that is related to ϕ, which according to axiom (P) will change to {a mathematical formula}CnLχ(χ)⋄ϕ, where ⋄ is a revision function defined over the sublanguage {a mathematical formula}Lχ.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then there is a {a mathematical formula}z∈[rx] such that {a mathematical formula}z⊑Kz′, for all {a mathematical formula}z′∈[rx′].</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">Within the AGM paradigm there are two constituents that are of particular interest for this article.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Loosely speaking, the set of ϕ-worlds occupy a territory in ⪯ that is disjoint from w. At the farthest end of this ϕ-territory there are worlds that look very different from w. However, as we move closer to w, the ϕ-worlds that we meet agree with w in progressively more and more propositional variables.</a>
