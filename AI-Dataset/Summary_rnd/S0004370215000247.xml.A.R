<a href="#0" id="0">HTN planners do not provide a general approach for handling interactions, thus each of the above interactions has its own resolution method.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Two of them are a direct extension of the study, while the other two draw inspiration from the study with respect to the translation process.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The tasks are decomposed to the level of mission tasks, which are decomposed into primitive tasks for individual missions (e.g., an unmanned strike mission), and for their support missions (e.g., reconnaissance).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Solution flexibility defines the ordering of operators in the solution to a planning problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Another type of constraint refines variable bindings if a certain variable binding does not satisfy some condition.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Each device service is encoded as a primitive task, and a composite process is modelled as a compound task whose methods encode all constructs of the process.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In particular, if a task from the task network is compound, the task decomposition continues on the next decomposition level, but in the same state.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">SHOP2 is employed in planning missions for unmanned aerial vehicle [98].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">First, we meet a constraint that implies commitments about partial descriptions of state objects.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, task preconditions are more expressive than the task effects.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It appears, however, that planners and their corresponding category still have some challenges to address.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We can conclude that HTN planning is able to express a broader and more complex set of planning problems than STRIPS-like planning.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The last style is partially ordered task decomposition (POTD) that allows the existence of a partial order on tasks.</a>
