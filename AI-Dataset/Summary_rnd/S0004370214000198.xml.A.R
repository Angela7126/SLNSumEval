<a href="#0" id="0">However, this is only sufficient to translate problems in the polynomial hierarchy, not PSPACE.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The initial state of the PDDL planning instance is given by {a mathematical formula}{last(jn),consecutive(j1,j2),…,consecutive(jn−1,jn)}, consisting solely of static fluents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Which of the two instances is solvable depends on the partial QBF {a mathematical formula}Fi(pi) and the parity of i. If i is odd, {a mathematical formula}xi is universal, in which case {a mathematical formula}Pi1′(pi) is solvable if and only if {a mathematical formula}Fi(pi) is satisfiable and {a mathematical formula}Pi2′(pi) is solvable if and only if {a mathematical formula}Fi(pi) is unsatisfiable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For clarity, we have separated the partial preconditions of actions {a mathematical formula}u111 and {a mathematical formula}u121 that match those in Fig. 1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The rest of the article is organized as follows.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Actions in {a mathematical formula}AS may have preconditions on {a mathematical formula}x1,…,xi−1, which is the purpose of including these variables.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We refer to {a mathematical formula}U2 as a conditional loop instance: whenever {a mathematical formula}b1 is false, the actions on {a mathematical formula}U2 are exactly those of a loop instance, but when {a mathematical formula}b1 is true, the properties of a loop instance no longer hold.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If a is initially true, there is no action making a false, rendering it impossible to satisfy the precondition {a mathematical formula}a¯ of {a mathematical formula}b1 required to make b true between {a mathematical formula}u11 and {a mathematical formula}x1.</a>
