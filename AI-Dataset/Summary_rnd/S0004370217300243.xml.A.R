<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}M2(⋅)The function {a mathematical formula}M2:CS(G)→R− is defined as{a mathematical formula} Intuitively, {a mathematical formula}Ud(CS) is the set of all agents (both riders and drivers) that are passengers of a car in CS.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Now, in several ridesharing online services (e.g., Lyft and Uber) a commuter declares whether he is available as a driver or as a rider, hence the two sets are disjoint and a feasible set of riders S contains at most one driver.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In GCCF problems a coalition structure CS is considered feasible if each of its coalitions is feasible, i.e., {a mathematical formula}CS(G)={CS∈Π(A)|CS⊆FC(G)}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When the denominator of {a mathematical formula}c‾i is 0, i.e, when {a mathematical formula}maxxS⁡=minxS, it means that all the agents in C have the same payoff.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, since both bounding techniques detailed in Section 3.3.1 are valid and, in general, one does not dominate on the other, we take the minimum one at each step of the algorithm, providing a more effective pruning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We include these time preferences in Equation (2) as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}LS⁎ and {a mathematical formula}τS⁎ represent the optimal path and the optimal departure time for S (Equation (14)), respectively.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Every driver {a mathematical formula}ai∈D can host up to {a mathematical formula}seats(ai) riders in his car, including himself, where the function {a mathematical formula}seats:A→N0 provides the number of seats of each car.</a>
