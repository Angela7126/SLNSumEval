<a href="#0" id="0">The following proposition shows that the canonical local function is defined accordingly.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We reason by contradiction, assuming that there are two distinct labellings {a mathematical formula}L1,L2∈FCO(AF,Minp,LE↓Minp,RINP).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, consider a labelling {a mathematical formula}L∈LST(AF).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Again, decomposability properties enable (and characterize the limits of) the use of incremental computation techniques based on the separation between modified and unmodified parts in the updated framework.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In fact, there are two preferred labellings in {a mathematical formula}AF1, namely {a mathematical formula}{(E1,in),(E2,out),(A1,out),(A2,in),(A3,out)} and {a mathematical formula}{(E1,out),(E2,in),(A1,out),(A2,in),(A3,out)}, while in {a mathematical formula}AF2 the preferred labellings are {a mathematical formula}{(E1,in),(E2,out),(C,out)} and {a mathematical formula}{(E1,out),(E2,in),(C,out)}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">After recalling the necessary background in Section 2, the general notions concerning semantics decomposability are introduced and discussed in Section 3, while Section 4 provides decomposability results for the seven semantics considered in this paper.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The claim (proved in [26] as part of Lemma 1) is that the grounded extension of the original framework is the same as the grounded extension of the framework resulting from the replacements mentioned above.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For instance, if an argument A of AF is attacked by an argument of {a mathematical formula}I which is labelled in, then {a mathematical formula}FS returns the same set of labellings independently of the presence and the number of additional attackers of A in {a mathematical formula}I. The effect of {a mathematical formula}(I,LI,RI) on the arguments Args of AF can be modelled as the labelling that would be induced on Args by neglecting the attacks inside AF.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">There are two cases to consider.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Again, since {a mathematical formula}LI1⊑LI2 the attacker B is labelled in also by {a mathematical formula}LI2, thus A is labelled out by {a mathematical formula}effArgs(I,LI2,RINP).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then there is an argument{a mathematical formula}A∈Arsuch that{a mathematical formula}L(A)=undecand a labelling{a mathematical formula}LA∈FAD(AF,I,LI,RI)such that{a mathematical formula}LA(A)∈{in,out}and{a mathematical formula}∀B∈Ar:B≠A,{a mathematical formula}LA(B)=L(B).</a>
