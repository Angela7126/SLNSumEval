<a href="#1" id="1">Assume the following:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, given a constraint language {a mathematical formula}Γ⊆B∨=, we do not know right away whether it is a model-complete core or not, and we do not know how to compute orbit-defining formulas.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It follows that {a mathematical formula}(Q;<) is model-complete, and that every Γ that is first-order definable in {a mathematical formula}(Q;<) is model-complete, too.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For every finite constraint language Γ over D, the computational complexity of CSP{a mathematical formula}(Γ∪Df) is known due to results by Bulatov [17].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To exemplify pp-definitions and Theorem 4, consider the structure {a mathematical formula}Γ={N;{1,2,3,4},≠}.</a>
