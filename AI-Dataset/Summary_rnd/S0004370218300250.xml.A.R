<a href="#0" id="0">Favoring atomic arguments: for any arguments {a mathematical formula}α,β such that α is atomic and β is defeasible it is not the case that {a mathematical formula}α<β.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence ∅ is a, obviously minimal, defeater of α. Conversely if ∅ is a, obviously minimal, defeater of α, it must be the case that {a mathematical formula}Conc(∅∪{α})=Conc(α) is incompatible.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">when considering the whole set of subarguments of α, {a mathematical formula}FIαΔ must indicate infallibility, since there are no elements involved in the construction of α in addition to {a mathematical formula}Sub(α) (which includes α itself) and a void addition cannot fail; for any argument β included in X, its subarguments cannot be regarded as additional to X in the construction of α. Hence, even if some subargument of β is not included in X the value of {a mathematical formula}FIαΔ(X) must be the same (this is graphically illustrated in Fig. 5, where it is meant that {a mathematical formula}X′=⋃β∈XSub(β)).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a matter of fact, this fact may have undesired consequences: suppose that there is an additional defeasible argument {a mathematical formula}α9 with conclusion ¬φ.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assume by contradiction that X is incompatible, i.e. there is a strict argument in contradiction which is based on {a mathematical formula}Conc(X).</a>
