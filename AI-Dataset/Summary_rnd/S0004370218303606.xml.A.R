<a href="#0" id="0">Approximation error is characterized as the average difference in the probabilities found by the two methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, it becomes untenable under occlusion because the required distributions over the full state-action space cannot be computed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Figure 6(c) shows the cells for the smaller environment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A fixed distribution that allocates some probability to turning is highly unlikely to model these portions of the patroller's behavior correctly.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We recorded the ω distribution during the numeric optimization of mIRL{sup:⁎}+Int for various levels of occlusion.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Subsequently, we modify the objective function of the relaxed Lagrangian so that the optimal solution(s) resides at a local or global maximum or minimum.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, could we form an informed expectation over the various ways in which the hidden state-action pairs may be realized?</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This revision to the equation has the effect of further under-constraining the optimization problem compared to the original.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Completing the MDP, the transition function models the probability of any of its own actions failing to reach its intended next state at 2.5%.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">While simulations were performed in both indoor environments, one larger than the other, physical robot experiments were performed in the smaller environment only.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To assist in finding the weights, feature expectations are calculated for the expert's demonstration and compared to those of possible policies.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As L lacks the option to stop, it moves toward the wall and turns around consuming the desired number of time steps.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In particular, actions that avoid a collision and keep the patroller moving are more rewarding.</a>
