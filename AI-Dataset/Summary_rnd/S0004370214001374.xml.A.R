<a href="#2" id="2">The resulting learning curves are shown in Fig. 12(a).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While generalization has proven to be accurate in humanoid reaching, grasping and drumming, the parameters are not improved by reinforcement learning.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When learning GP forward models, numerical problems may emerge.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The Lagrangian parameters are found by optimizing the dual function{a mathematical formula} The dual function is convex in θ and η, and the corresponding gradients can be obtained in closed form.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">In our approach, we propose to learn the models by interacting with the environment.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">After obtaining a desired trajectory by the DMP, the trajectory is followed by a feedback controller which is part of the lower-level control policy.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In optimal control, the exact model of the controllable system, or at least the structure of the model is usually assumed to be known.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To combine the uniform convergence property of the natural gradient approaches [31] and the closed form policy update of EM-based PS approaches, the information theoretic Relative Entropy Policy Search (REPS) algorithm has been proposed in [30].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Depending on the task, we can use linear feedback controllers, movement primitives [17] or torque profiles [28].</a>
