<a href="#0" id="0">None of the predictions looks perceptually “wrong”.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Inference amounts to generating a set of variable assignments to all blocks, so that none of conditions (i)–(v) is violated, and the cost of the soft rules is minimized.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The idea behind Learning Modulo Theories is that, when a hybrid Boolean-numerical problem can be encoded in SMT, the two oracles can be implemented using an Optimization Modulo Theory solver.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This paper builds on a previous work in which MAX-SMT was used for interactive preference elicitation [25].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The authors show how to compute the probability of success of a query, by partitioning the continuous space into admissible intervals, within which values are interchangeable with respect to the provability of the query.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These currently include linear arithmetic over both rationals and integers as well as a number of other theories like strings, arrays and bit-vectors.</a>
