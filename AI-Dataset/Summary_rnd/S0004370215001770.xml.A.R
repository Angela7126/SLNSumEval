<a href="#0" id="0">A d-DNNF that is logically equivalent with the one obtained by {a mathematical formula}Compile(KB1.5∧KBI) can be obtained by only compiling {a mathematical formula}KB1.5 with a general-purpose tool and adding {a mathematical formula}Pr⁡(I) to the resulting circuit by means of conditioning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">With these entries we associate the indicator variable {a mathematical formula}Faultyt.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">More precisely, the benefit of evaluating the circuit multiple times (ENC3) is that the cost of compilation is amortized over all queries.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Computing the forward message, however, is in general much slower compared to the other encodings, as also indicated in Table 2.</a>
