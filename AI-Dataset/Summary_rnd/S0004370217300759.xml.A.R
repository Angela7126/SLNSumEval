<a href="#0" id="0">For any{a mathematical formula}RCDformula φ,{an inline-figure}is valid.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence {a mathematical formula}Γ_∧¬RG→Kiψ is consistent, and so is {a mathematical formula}Γ_∧Dˆδ¬RG→ψ, where {a mathematical formula}δ=δ({i},G→).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Assume towards a contradiction that there is a {a mathematical formula}PACD formula φ that is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}Rjk¬Cijk¬p.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When{an inline-figure},{a mathematical formula}RCDis equally expressive as{a mathematical formula}ELCD.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, in state t in the model M in Fig. 1, neither {a mathematical formula}K1p nor {a mathematical formula}K2p is true, but {a mathematical formula}D{1,2}p is true.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We say that two pointed models are (logically) equivalent if they satisfy exactly the same formulas.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">From {a mathematical formula}¬RG→ψ∈Θ we get {a mathematical formula}RG→ψ∉Θ.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In [34, Definition 8.45] a class of models called “hairpin models” is defined.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The central result is a truth lemma for the canonical pseudo model (Lemma 41), from which we can get the completeness result relatively easily.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We say pointed models {a mathematical formula}(M,s) and {a mathematical formula}(M′,s′) are (individually) bisimilar, denoted {a mathematical formula}(M,s)⇄(M′,s′), if there is an individual bisimulation Z between {a mathematical formula}M and {a mathematical formula}M′ linking s and {a mathematical formula}s′.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">That {a mathematical formula}s∼it is the case means that agent i cannot discern between states s and t: if we are in s she does not know whether we are in t, and vice versa.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">There are some complications.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">By item 5 of this lemma {a mathematical formula}Ξ∽iΘ (where ∽ is the relation in the canonical pseudo model for {a mathematical formula}cl(α)).</a>
