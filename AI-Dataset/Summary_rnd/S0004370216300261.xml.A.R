<a href="#0" id="0">Based on the Hoeffding–Azuma inequality [6], we have{a mathematical formula}Step 2: Symmetrization by a ghost sampleWe begin with a ghost sample {a mathematical formula}S˜T={(x˜1,y˜1),(x˜2,y˜2),…,(x˜T,y˜T)} drawn i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">There has been previous work of [30], [47], which considered the following formulation:{a mathematical formula} Notice that{a mathematical formula} Thus, our formulation is different from the work of [30], [47].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Proof of Proposition 1 We first have{a mathematical formula} The distribution {a mathematical formula}D can be specified exactly by the triplet {a mathematical formula}(D+,D−,p), and assume that {a mathematical formula}x1,…,xTS+ are selected i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This strategy, however, does not work empirically (Section 7) because much information is lost in dimensionality reduction.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Similar to Section 7.1, five-fold cross validation is executed on training sets to determine the learning rate {a mathematical formula}ηt∈2[−12:10] and the regularization parameter {a mathematical formula}λ∈2[−10:2].</a>
