<a href="#0" id="0">Considering the non-determinism and the unlikely, but possible interference of other system processes, every measurement was repeated 10 times{sup:4} and the results were averaged.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">All public actions have private preconditions on the state of the lift, its capacity, etc.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A multi-agent variant of heuristic search was proposed in [5] as a multi-agent optimal search (MAD-A*) and in [6], [3] as Multi-Agent Greedy Best-First Search (MA-BFS).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, we define the sequence of search nodes corresponding to a particular run of the algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The direction {a mathematical formula}ODi→OLi is straightforward as most of the time, {a mathematical formula}hDi dominates {a mathematical formula}hLi.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A path with a resulting search node{a mathematical formula}ul is a sequence of search nodes {a mathematical formula}path(ul)=(u0,...,ul), possibly of different agents (different k s.t.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">8× longer to evaluate on average (column MADLA{a mathematical formula}th right in Table 3), but its better heuristic guidance (11×more expanded states using the projected heuristic) results in almost equal coverage (Table 1).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">All actions in the domain are public but have some private precondition, which means there are some dependencies among the actions not known to all agents.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The agents are not restricted only to their {a mathematical formula}Πi problems, as each agent is aware of other agents' public actions in the form of projections.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The other direction {a mathematical formula}OLi→ODi is trickier.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The other one is a distributed heuristic {a mathematical formula}hDi (Definition 3) evaluating the multi-agent problem {a mathematical formula}M in a distributed manner.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The plan-based coordination planner Distoplan [32] pioneered an idea of planning by intersection of Finite State Machines (FSM) representing the local plans of the agents.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The expansion procedure is detailed in Algorithm 2.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The novel aspect of the algorithm is the use of a set-additive principle [24] to overcome over-counting and also an adaptation towards more privacy.</a>
