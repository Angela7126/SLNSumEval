<a href="#0" id="0">In our setting, an auction mechanism is considered to elicit the true costs from the experts with heterogeneous qualities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, the valuation of an expert i is {a mathematical formula}vi=−ci.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can use this generic transformation to design the mechanism in our setting.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Again, consider the following cases when expert i changes his bid to {a mathematical formula}ci−:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The property is given as follows:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Often such mechanisms are referred to as Multi-Armed Bandit Mechanisms or simply MAB mechanisms[10], [11], [12], [13].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, we get,{a mathematical formula} Using the fact that {a mathematical formula}kl(p1,p2)≤(p1−p2)2p2(1−p2) and expert 2 is suboptimal with quality profile q we get:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Practical aspects and experimental results</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Non-strategic version</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We compare the regret of four algorithms namely, CCB-NS, CCB-S, CCB-SE and a variant of the {a mathematical formula}εt-greedy algorithm.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A similar setting with an assured quality is considered in [15].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let {a mathematical formula}S⁎ and {a mathematical formula}St denote the optimal set and set selected at time t respectively.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The number of non-optimal rounds by the CCB-NS algorithm is bounded by{a mathematical formula}2n(h−1(Δ))2ln⁡(2nμ)with probability{a mathematical formula}1−μ.Lemma 4.1 shows that the CCB-NS exploitation rounds are optimal rounds.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In this section, we consider the majority rule as the aggregation rule and solve Example 3.1 by formulating it as a minimum knapsack problem.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">With cost {a mathematical formula}ci, expert i belongs to set {a mathematical formula}Sl where {a mathematical formula}l≤q: Now consider the following cases when the cost of expert i is decreased from {a mathematical formula}ci to {a mathematical formula}ci−:</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This upper bound matches the lower bound up to a constant factor.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For brevity of notation, in the rest of the paper we will use {a mathematical formula}qˆ−≤q≤qˆ+ to represent {a mathematical formula}qˆi−≤qi≤qˆi+∀i∈N.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">An expert i incurs a cost {a mathematical formula}ci∈R which is privately held and can be reported strategically.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Similarly, the sets {a mathematical formula}B0,B1,…,Bq are called as big sets and the elements of these sets are called as big elements.</a>
