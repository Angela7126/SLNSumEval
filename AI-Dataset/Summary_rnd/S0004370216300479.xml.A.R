<a href="#1" id="1">Without loss of generality we can take the general form of successor state axioms to be as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By reduction to FO unsatisfiability.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Abstract finite-state transition system</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">That is, any object occurring in {a mathematical formula}I′ that comes from {a mathematical formula}I(q) must be mapped into itself.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Under these assumptions, {a mathematical formula}(Φ′)(v,V)T is easily computable by recursive applications of the definition of {a mathematical formula}(⋅)(v,V)T (page 186).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">□</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By induction hypothesis, such a {a mathematical formula}ϕA′ exists.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Now we define a new action theory {a mathematical formula}D′ which can be considered a sort of projection of {a mathematical formula}DD over the primed fluents only.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, when we move to temporal properties, virtually all approaches are based on assuming a finite domain and a finite number of states, and often rely on propositional modal logics and model checking techniques [6], [63].</a>
