<a href="#0" id="0">This is equivalent to the conjunction of the two following two-sided inequality constraints:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}u=P−A′, {a mathematical formula}v=P−B′ and {a mathematical formula}u⊥=(−u2,u1), and {a mathematical formula}〈⋅|⋅〉 is the scalar product.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Preliminaries</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For a given generalized aspect {a mathematical formula}A, its projection {a mathematical formula}Ax is a maximal singularity-free region in the robot reachable workspace.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Applying this heuristic, practical, post-process, the number of obtained CSNCs, reported at Line “{a mathematical formula}# CSNCsfiltered” in Table 1, reaches the theoretically known number of aspects in the cases of the robots we considered.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The computation of {a mathematical formula}N, i.e., the links that satisfy Property {a mathematical formula}(P3), is done in two steps:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Line “time” gives the overall computational time in seconds of the method, including the connected components computation with connectivity certification.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Handling additional constraints</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The same heuristic filtering can thus be used to isolate the largest CSNCs of practical interest.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The Jacobian matrix of {a mathematical formula}f(x) with respect to the subset {a mathematical formula}x′ of the variables x is denoted {a mathematical formula}Fx′(x).</a>
