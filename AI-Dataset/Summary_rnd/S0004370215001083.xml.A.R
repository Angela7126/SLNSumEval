<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}〈Ω′,Λ〉⊞˙(i{an inline-figure}e3)/o3′ is an ontology revision that raises a global inconsistency, which may be solved locally by removing {a mathematical formula}b3⊥c3 (and {a mathematical formula}b3⊥e3) or {a mathematical formula}e3⊑c3 from {a mathematical formula}o3′, but can also be solved more globally, for instance, by removing {a mathematical formula}(b1≤d2) from {a mathematical formula}A1,2 (and several other assertions including {a mathematical formula}i{an inline-figure}b3 from {a mathematical formula}o3′); {a mathematical formula}〈Ω,Λ′〉⊞˙(b1≥e3)/A1,3′ is an alignment revision that raises a global inconsistency that may be solved, for instance, by removing {a mathematical formula}d2≥b1 from {a mathematical formula}A1,2 or {a mathematical formula}d2⊑c2 from {a mathematical formula}o2, but cannot be solved by modifying {a mathematical formula}A1,3 itself; {a mathematical formula}〈Ω″,Λ〉⊞˙(d2⊑c2)/o2″ is an ontology revision that raises a global inconsistency ({a mathematical formula}o2 is consistent) which may be solved, for instance, by removing {a mathematical formula}b3⊥c3 (and {a mathematical formula}b3⊥e3) from {a mathematical formula}o3 or {a mathematical formula}b1≥e3 from {a mathematical formula}A1,3, but cannot be solved by modifying anything in {a mathematical formula}o2 itself.</a>
