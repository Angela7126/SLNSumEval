<a href="#0" id="0">The runtime distribution of the top 12 solvers is displayed in Fig. 5 for all benchmarks and separately for SAT and UNSAT benchmarks in Fig. 6.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the case of SAT it makes, indeed, no sense while the formula cannot change its satisfiability status without new input in the form of clauses or new assumptions from the user.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Assumptions can be specified by calling the ipasir_assume function, which takes literals encoded as integers in the same way as the add function.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The selection method is similar to the ones used in the previous competitions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">High similarity is again observed between different versions of the same solvers (CryptoMiniSat, glucose, pcasso).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If the search process was interrupted the return value is 0 and the solver returns to the UNKNOWN state.</a>
