<a href="#1" id="1">However, if you have imperfect knowledge of the shape of the blocks, then it is much less clear how to proceed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Species evolution is related to genes; this is a factor of about 10{sup:34}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Decomposition: If a system consists of two uncoupled subsystems, then one can reason about each separately.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">18327] propose a model of physical reasoning based on an “intuitive physics engine,” a cognitive mechanism similar to computer engines that simulate rich physics in video games and graphics, but that uses approximate, probabilistic simulations to make robust and fast inferences.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">For instance, an object may be partially occluded.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this case, it is impossible to effectively simulate because there is no information about the exogenous events involved.</a>
