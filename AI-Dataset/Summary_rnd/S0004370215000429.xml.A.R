<a href="#0" id="0">Notice that {a mathematical formula}|∑i=1jxi| from the definition of C-boundedness above can be characterised as the absolute value of the difference of the number of occurrences of +1 in {a mathematical formula}x1,…,xj and the number of occurrences of −1 in {a mathematical formula}x1,…,xj.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Eliminating this extra information from a DRUP proof converts it to a valid RUP proof.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One of the oldest problems of combinatorial discrepancy theory is the discrepancy of hypergraphs over sets of natural numbers with the subsets (hyperedges) forming arithmetical progressions over these sets [19].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First notice that any assignment {a mathematical formula}Ip:{p1,…,pn)→{0,1} can be extended in a unique way to the assignment {a mathematical formula}I:vars(Φ(p1,…,pn))→{0,1}.</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">Notice that the general definition of discrepancy given in the introduction can be specialised in terms of partial sums of subsequences of a ±1 sequence.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We saw in Example 2 that multiplicative sequences of discrepancy 1 are longer than completely multiplicative sequences.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Famously, it took four years to accept for publication the paper on the computer proof of Kepler's conjecture and still reviewers were not completely satisfied as they could not verify the entire computer program that was used to find the answer [5].</a>
