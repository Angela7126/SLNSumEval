<a href="#1" id="1">An important question in the context of strategic voting, including the iterative voting model, is whether an obtained equilibrium state is good for the society according to various metrics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}ait∈Wt (i.e., step t is a direct reply).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Starting from the truthful state {a mathematical formula}(d,c,d) the agents can make the following two improvement steps, which are direct replies (showing only the outcome s and the winner): {a mathematical formula}(2,2,3,2){c}→1(2,3,3,1){b}→3(3,3,3,0){a}, after which agents 1 and 2 repeat the cycle shown in Example 4.3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Another rule where a natural direct reply exists is Veto, where a voter can veto the current winner [46].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A game G is weakly-FIP if there is some scheduler ϕ such that {a mathematical formula}〈G,a0,ϕ〉 converges for any {a mathematical formula}a0.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that at every step there is only one direct reply available to the agent, thus it is not possible to eliminate the cycle by further restricting the action scheduler.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the remainder of this paper we focus on the weaker notions of convergence as discussed in Section 1, which are more relevant to social choice.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We therefore restrict attention in the rest of this section to unweighted voters.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then{a mathematical formula} thus {a mathematical formula}a≻L{a}∪W≻LW and Axiom G holds.Axiom K1 follows immediately from G. K2 also follows if preferences are strict.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Using the Hamming code q, we map each outcome {a mathematical formula}xt∈X to a specific profile {a mathematical formula}at∈{0,1}n by setting the first {a mathematical formula}k‾ bits of {a mathematical formula}at to {a mathematical formula}q(bin(t,k))∈{0,1}k‾, the n'th bit to 0.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Stochastic dominance Reyhani and Wilson [12] assume that ties are broken uniformly at random, and that a voter will only perform a step that stochastically dominates the current winner(s), if such exists.</a>
