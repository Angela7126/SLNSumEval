<a href="#0" id="0">Consequently, placing an object with a specific orientation often requires a robot to grasp the object with a specific orientation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These approaches include aSyMov [12] and SamplSGD [13].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Actions are hybrid, since they imply a change both in the symbolic state and in the geometric state.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The REVCHRONO criterion is defined as follows: if failed attempts occur while attempting to satisfy the preconditions of an action {a mathematical formula}ai, then we select the action {a mathematical formula}ai−1 that is the direct predecessor of {a mathematical formula}ai in P. However, such a criterion does not take into account what actually caused the difficulty of applying the current action.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, the raw path is augmented with intermediary configurations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This may happen for instance if a cup is not reachable in the initial state: although the cup is not located far from the robot, the position together with the orientation of the cup can result in a set of kinematically infeasible grasps.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Using the notation in Fig. 12, grasp constraints can be formulated using two parameters: the distance between the TCP and base of the object (δ), and the orthogonal distance between the TCP and the main axis of the object (ϵ).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Such representations are insufficient for modeling the kinematic and geometric properties of the robot and its environment.</a>
