<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}ΓP are {a mathematical formula}(b,b) and {a mathematical formula}(cd,cd), i.e., {a mathematical formula}EQ(P)=EQ(ΓP)={(b,b),(cd,cd)}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We observe that {a mathematical formula}({c},{b}) is a related, but not a joinable pair, because {a mathematical formula}({c},{b}) satisfies conditions (i) and (iii), but not (ii).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The latter contradicts the assumption that M is an answer-set, i.e., a minimal model, of {a mathematical formula}Pκ.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, the well-founded model is the least partial stable model (see Section 8.2.4 below); it has been characterized in the logic HT{sup:2} in terms of the partial equilibrium model that leaves the most atoms undefined [14].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If we put{a mathematical formula}Sk=J1∪…∪Jkfor{a mathematical formula}k=1,…,mand{a mathematical formula}Si′=Si−1∪Ji+1then{a mathematical formula}In general we know that {a mathematical formula}bSi(P)∖bSi−1(P)=bSi(P∖bSi−1(P)).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then{a mathematical formula}K1and{a mathematical formula}K2satisfy (i) and (ii) ofDefinition 12iff they are disconnected in{a mathematical formula}SG(P), i.e., no path from{a mathematical formula}K1to{a mathematical formula}K2and vice versa exists.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since {a mathematical formula}M⊨Pκ, {a mathematical formula}(I,J) is a bi-model of P by Proposition 5.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We let {a mathematical formula}JC(P)={⋃i=1mKi|K1,…,Km∈SCC(P) are joinable} and call{a mathematical formula} the set of all maximal joined components ({a mathematical formula}MJCs) of P. Note that {a mathematical formula}(K1,K2)∈JP(P) implies that {a mathematical formula}K1 and {a mathematical formula}K2 are joinable (choose {a mathematical formula}K=K1).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This modularity property in fact generalizes to a more abstract view of a program that is based on splitting sets of program [31].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}P⊨SEQc,va], i.e., a has value v in some (every) {a mathematical formula}(X,Y)∈SEQ(P) value v.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Furthermore, we can reduce the subprogram semantics of program P w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The remainder of this article is organized as follows.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This leads us to propose an amendment to the semi-stable model semantics, which we present in the next section.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We show that there exists {a mathematical formula}M∈mc(AS(PHT)) such that {a mathematical formula}β(M∩Σκ)=(H,T).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">However such simple postprocessing is not efficient in general; indeed, the {a mathematical formula}Σ3P/{a mathematical formula}Π3P-completeness of brave/cautious reasoning, respectively, calls for better methods.</a>
