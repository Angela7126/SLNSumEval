<a href="#0" id="0">We therefore construct an extension of {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎, denoted ⪯, which is total and moreover preserves the minimal μ-worlds (as defined with respect to {a mathematical formula}⪯′), for all Horn formulas μ. The total preorder ⪯ is shown to be the desired preorder.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Specific Horn revision operators</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If {a mathematical formula}w∈[μ] and {a mathematical formula}w′∈[¬μ] then {a mathematical formula}w≺w′ entails {a mathematical formula}w≺μw′.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We address these issues by first restricting the semantic construction involving faithful rankings to “well behaved” orderings, those that we call Horn compliant.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2∈[K] then {a mathematical formula}w1≈Kw2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Firstly, for a set of atoms {a mathematical formula}Pi, by {a mathematical formula}Pi¯ we denote the set of negated atoms of {a mathematical formula}Pi; i.e. {a mathematical formula}Pi¯={¬p|p∈Pi}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">There are two primary means of constructing contraction functions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Yet {a mathematical formula}w3 and {a mathematical formula}w4 agree on the variables inside their (common) difference from H. We call the first pair of worlds {a mathematical formula}w1, {a mathematical formula}w2external H-duals, and the second pair {a mathematical formula}w3, {a mathematical formula}w4, internal H-duals.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">As mentioned in the beginning of the proof, the next step is to define an extension of {a mathematical formula}⪯⁎ which is total, and preserves the μ-minimal worlds, for all Horn formulas μ. To this end, consider the sequence of sets of worlds {a mathematical formula}S0,S1,… , defined recursively as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
