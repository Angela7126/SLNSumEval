<a href="#1" id="1">In the sequel, for a complete lattice {a mathematical formula}(L,⊑) with join ⊔ and meet ⊓, we assume the existence of a function {a mathematical formula}⋅−1:L→L such that for any {a mathematical formula}x,y∈L, {a mathematical formula}(x−1)−1=x ({a mathematical formula}⋅−1 is involutive), {a mathematical formula}(x⊔y)−1=x−1⊓y−1 and {a mathematical formula}(x⊓y)−1=x−1⊔y−1 (de Morganʼs laws).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We see that {a mathematical formula}STπ2(∅,A)=({a},{a,b,c}): intuitively, a is added to the lower bound since its body is satisfied, d is removed from the upper bound because there is no program rule to derive d. Applying {a mathematical formula}STπ2 again leads to the pair {a mathematical formula}({a,b,c},{a,b,c}) which is an exact fixpoint and thus the only two-valued stable model of {a mathematical formula}π2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If {a mathematical formula}−∈l(a), then there is a {a mathematical formula}b∈A with {a mathematical formula}(b,a)∈R and {a mathematical formula}+∈l(b).</a>
