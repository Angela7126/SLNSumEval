<a href="#0" id="0">An infinitary formula is a theorem of{a mathematical formula}C∞iff it is tautological.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the basis of that correspondence, finite proofs can be sometimes used to justify the validity of infinitary formulas.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}(G→H)I is {a mathematical formula}GI→HI if {a mathematical formula}I⊨G→H, and ⊥ otherwise.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It follows that {a mathematical formula}v(F2) is different from ∅, and therefore must be {a mathematical formula}{T} also.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is easy to check by induction on the rank that every formula that is forced in H is forced in T as well.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">About sets {a mathematical formula}H1, {a mathematical formula}H2 of infinitary formulas we say that they are strongly equivalent to each other if, for every set {a mathematical formula}H of infinitary formulas, the sets {a mathematical formula}H1∪H and {a mathematical formula}H2∪H have the same stable models.</a>
