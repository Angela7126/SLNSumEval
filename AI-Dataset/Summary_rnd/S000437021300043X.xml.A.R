<a href="#5" id="5">Bel is also a probability function on {a mathematical formula}J(P).For any minimal element{a mathematical formula}θ∈P,{a mathematical formula}Bel({θ})=m({θ}).It follows directly from the fact that, for any minimal element {a mathematical formula}θ∈P, {a mathematical formula}{θ} is a singleton principal order ideal of P, i.e., {a mathematical formula}{θ}∈J(P) that {a mathematical formula}Bel({θ})=m({θ}).</a>
