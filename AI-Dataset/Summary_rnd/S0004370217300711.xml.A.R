<a href="#0" id="0">mina-relevanceisnp-complete for core KBs.The problem is clearly in np: a nondeterministic algorithm for solving it first guesses a subset of {a mathematical formula}K, and then tests in polynomial time whether it is a MinA containing Ïˆ. For showing hardness we provide a reduction from the following np-complete problem [52]:</a>
