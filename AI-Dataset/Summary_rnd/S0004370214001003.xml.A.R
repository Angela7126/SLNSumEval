<a href="#0" id="0">We show that by using only general appliance models and smart meter data, advice can be given to household occupants regarding the operating energy efficiency of the appliances and whether it is cost effective to replace them.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The first (GT) uses the general appliance model as learned empirically in Section 2 without any model tuning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Through a cross validation evaluation, we showed that only a small number of instances of each type are required for simple appliances, such as the kettle.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, in households where aggregate data is more limited or where overlapping appliance usage is more common, we would expect that a smaller step size would allow a greater number of signatures to be extracted.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Appliance instance parameter estimation using hidden Markov models</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">VMP is a generalisation of variational inference, which allows variational inference to be applied to arbitrary Bayesian networks.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Last, we provide an evaluation using the REDD data set which demonstrates the benefit of model tuning from aggregate data (Section 3.3).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This provides the occupants with a quantitative measure which can be compared with the cost of other appliances within the household or even a total household bill.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The data set consists of samples of appliances' power demand at roughly one second intervals.</a>
