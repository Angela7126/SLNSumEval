<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, MD is now able to compute a larger independent set, leading to find a better lower bound for z. For instance, if we consider the independent set {a mathematical formula}{x1,x2,x3} (Fig. 3b), then {a mathematical formula}R1 and {a mathematical formula}R2 respectively state that the number of values is at least three and that the value 5 can be removed from the variable domains.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}LB≠ is used as a baseline comparison.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As the AtMostNValue propagation relies on lower bounding, we can expect a strong propagation during the bottom–up step.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This problem typically occurs as the second step of decomposition methods which handle the creation of shifts in a first step.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A wide range of experiments shows that our contribution significantly improves the CP model, so that it competes with the most recent SMPTSP dedicated approaches.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Unfortunately, {a mathematical formula}breif does not help solving Data_100 instances, which have more structure in the design of shifts, to the contrary.</a>
