<a href="#0" id="0">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}Sw is an equilibrium of {a mathematical formula}M[br(M)∖D1∪fg(D2)] and {a mathematical formula}(D1,D2,fg)∈D±,r(M).Towards contradiction assume that {a mathematical formula}(D1,D2,fg) is not minimal, then there exists {a mathematical formula}(D1′,D2′,fg′)∈Dm±,r(M) such that {a mathematical formula}(D1′,D2′)⊂(D1,D2) or {a mathematical formula}D1=D1′, {a mathematical formula}D2=D2′, and {a mathematical formula}fg′<fg.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Proposition 4 is an immediate consequence of the close structural relationships between diagnoses and explanations, which are shown by Theorem 1, Theorem 2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The whole system gets inconsistent (which renders the system useless) unless such special cases were anticipated when contexts and bridge rules were modeled.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It remains to single out settings where scalability is still possible, and to get a clearer picture of the scalability frontier.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that {a mathematical formula}IE={e1(r)|r∈E1}∪{ne1(r)|r∈br(M)∖E1}∪{e2(r)|r∈E2}∪{ne2(r)|r∈br(M)∖E2}∪Ispoil is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}PPE(M).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Wlog.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Observe that for every {a mathematical formula}r∈E2 holds that {a mathematical formula}fg(r)=r, therefore for all sets {a mathematical formula}R1,R2 of bridge rules with {a mathematical formula}r∈R2 holds that {a mathematical formula}R1∪fg(R2)=R1∪{r}∪fg(R2∖{r}).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">On the other hand, the procedural techniques seem to be less promising, as MCS lack rule chaining at the abstract level.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">□</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We next give a syntactic criterion which enables the computation of explanations for an MCS M in a divide-and-conquer fashion.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">(coNP-hardness for {a mathematical formula}CC(M)=P) We reuse the MCSeq hardness proof where a 3-SAT instance F was reduced to MCS {a mathematical formula}M=(CgenU,CevalF,Ccheck).</a>
