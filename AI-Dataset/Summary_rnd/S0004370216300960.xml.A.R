<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:6} This implementation is non-generic, allowing execution only over three domains: Battleship, Wumpus, and Minesweeper, where it performs very well.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Formally, {a mathematical formula}drift={a mathematical formula}{driftup,driftdown}, where {a mathematical formula}driftup contains a condition {a mathematical formula}(at3,2,at3,3∧¬at3,2) and {a mathematical formula}driftdown contains a condition {a mathematical formula}(at3,2,at3,1∧¬at3,2).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, all rocks are causally relevant to the green light observation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We now extend regression to an action and an ensuing observation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, the worst-case complexity of regression depends only on the actions that actually appear in the sequence, as opposed to the entire set of actions in the progression-based FBT, potentially leading to a lower width notion, which we call contextual width.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Observations are regressed only once, and the cost of their regression is amortized over all future regressions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consequently, many of the techniques explored in this paper have their background in situation calculus.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the Localize problem, let us regresses the formula {a mathematical formula}ϕ=at3,2 through the move-up action.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Empirical evaluation</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Checking the applicability of an action requires one online belief-tracking query for each of its preconditions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">On the theoretical side, we exploit the notion of width [19], [5], [6] to provide a tighter, width-based bound on the complexity of regression.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For a non-deterministic action {a mathematical formula}a={a1,…,am} we define [22]:{a mathematical formula}[22]Let ϕ be a formula, let a be a non-deterministic action, and s a state.</a>
