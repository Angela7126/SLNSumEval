<a href="#0" id="0">For example, approaches to capturing semantics in (standard) AFs are, often, presented in set-theoretic terms: a collection of justified arguments being a subset of arguments in an AF that satisfy some criteria.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As A is admissible we have that {a mathematical formula}Fˆ(A)=A and further for each set B with {a mathematical formula}A⊆B that {a mathematical formula}A⊆Fˆ(B).</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">This can be testing by checking{a mathematical formula} which can be carried out in co-NP.To establish co-NP-hardness we use a reduction from unsat without loss of generality restricted to instances in 3-cnf.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, we note that the view promoted in our treatment of ideal reasoning is by no means limited to semantics in Dungʼs AFs but, as discussed in Section 7 can also be considered with respect to such developments as value-based frameworks [6].</a>
