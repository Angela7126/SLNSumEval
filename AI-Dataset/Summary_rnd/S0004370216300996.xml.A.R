<a href="#0" id="0">It presents the CPU time required to maintain GIC along a complete branch built by performing random variable assignments down to a leaf.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">□</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The proof is as follows:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Clearly the assignment {a mathematical formula}{(xi,0)|i∈V} is a solution of N, so N is satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In lines 1–3, GAC is maintained after each decision taken in sequence from {a mathematical formula}Δreplay.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that discarding the first decision is the most adverse case (i.e., requiring the most computing effort), which is the reason for studying this particular case.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Third, we experimentally show that the most efficient of our algorithms is efficient enough to be used in an interactive constraint solving loop of several non-trivial configuration and design problems.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">These GIC algorithms use increasingly sophisticated data structures and techniques that have recently proved their worth in propagation algorithms proposed in the literature.</a>
