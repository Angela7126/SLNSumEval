<a href="#1" id="1">As a convention, double default negation is absorbed, so {a mathematical formula}∼∼l denotes the objective literal l.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">U. Let {a mathematical formula}M be the MKNF interpretation corresponding to J and for every {a mathematical formula}α<μ, {a mathematical formula}Xα the MKNF interpretation corresponding to {a mathematical formula}Jα.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let A, B be sets of predicate symbols and{a mathematical formula}M,N∈M.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A static consequence operator and its fixed points</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Moreover, by Observation 95(4),{a mathematical formula} and also{a mathematical formula}Lemma 129 implies that {a mathematical formula}σ(M,Uα)=⋂β≤αXβ and since {a mathematical formula}Xα+1=σ(M,Uα+1∖Uα), it follows that {a mathematical formula}Xα+1 is an MKNF model of{a mathematical formula}Third, for every limit ordinal {a mathematical formula}α<μ, {a mathematical formula}Xα=IL holds by definition.Fourth, we need to verify that {a mathematical formula}⋂α<μXα≠∅.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also assume that ⊎ has a neutral element {a mathematical formula}0∈S, i.e. {a mathematical formula}X⊎0=0⊎X=X for all {a mathematical formula}X∈S, and that {a mathematical formula}〚∅〛S={0}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consequence relationSuppose that both ⋄ and {a mathematical formula}S have the splitting sequence property, conserve the language and respect fact update, let K be a layered DMKB and {a mathematical formula}T an MKNF theory.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This implies that {a mathematical formula}J⊨l and we can conclude that {a mathematical formula}Xα+1⊨l.</a>
