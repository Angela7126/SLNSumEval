<a href="#0" id="0">Multi-robot task allocation Multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) is focused on the problem of allocating a set of tasks to a group of robots so as to maximize a utility function.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Lines 7–30 of Algorithm 4 show how the matrices are filled in, where the counter α keeps track of the row number of the matrices.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, suppose that a disaster has occurred in an urban area (such as a city), and that multiple urban search-and-rescue (USAR) personnel have arrived on the scene to offer their aid.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}|A|⩽n during the execution of the algorithm, and contains the fixed members of the team, e.g., if {a mathematical formula}n=5 and {a mathematical formula}A={a1,a2}, then FindδOptimalTeam returns the optimal team of 5 agents given that {a mathematical formula}{a1,a2} are in the team.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The learning algorithm does not have guaranteed bounds on the learned result but from our experiments, we believe that a small number of iterations of simulated annealing (compared to the entire space of weighted graphs) is sufficient to learn a model that matches the observed data well.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When a disaster occurs, researchers from around the world arrive with their USAR robots.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As such, the runtime of FindδOptimalTeam is {a mathematical formula}O(Nn).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Learning the weighted synergy graph</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We showed that the weighted synergy graph model forms a near-optimal team, outperforming the teams selected with IQ-ASyMTRe.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The performance of a team is the utility attained by that team when performing the task, and is domain-dependent.</a>
