<a href="#0" id="0">Thus, if the welfare of students is important, then PLDA-RQ would be a better choice.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Finally, Section 7 concludes our paper.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The priorities of schools are given as: {a mathematical formula}s1≻c1s2 and {a mathematical formula}s1≻c2s2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Similarly, z is accepted in {a mathematical formula}ChC(X′∪{x}) iff by adding z, the values of {a mathematical formula}er′ for all {a mathematical formula}r′∈Path(r,c″)∩(Path(r,c)∪Path(r,c′)) does not increase (since if this happens, then {a mathematical formula}er(Y∪{x,z})>qr holds) and {a mathematical formula}er′(Y∪{x,z})≤qr′ holds for all {a mathematical formula}r′∈Path(r,c″)∖(Path(r,c)∪Path(r,c′)).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If set of regions R is hierarchical, we can construct a tree that represents R. We assume that C, which is the region that contains all schools, is included in R. We also assume C has non-binding minimum quota {a mathematical formula}pC=n and maximum quota {a mathematical formula}qC=n, where n is the number of students.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The choice function {a mathematical formula}ChC of PLDA-RQ is given as follows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since {a mathematical formula}X′ is semi-school-feasible, we can choose a contract {a mathematical formula}x=(s,c) such that {a mathematical formula}X′∪{x} is semi-school-feasible.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note that a regional maximum quota can be represented as a regional minimum quota and vice versa.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Initialize Y to ∅.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Kojima [19] considers a model where students are divided into two types, i.e., minority and majority, and shows that setting hard-bounds for the number of majority students may hurt the minority students.</a>
