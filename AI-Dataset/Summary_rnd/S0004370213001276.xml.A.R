<a href="#1" id="1">Several previous studies have explored taxonomy-based recommendation [7], [8], [22], [23], [24], [25].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on these results, we can see that Linked Taxonomies improved the accuracy more when the dataset was sparser.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, we provide a brief introduction to CF methods.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Normalization is necessary because we want to harmonize the impact of the similarity of users for the SAs given to each item and to each item class.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We add the removed SA s to {a mathematical formula}S and select another candidate SA from {a mathematical formula}S. After checking all of the candidates in {a mathematical formula}S, we determines that SA s has to be removed from {a mathematical formula}S if {a mathematical formula}maxs∈S{As}>A.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Related work</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We set the total number of items in the list for the MAP computation for each user as 200 because we assumed that the high ranked items would be more important.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Their earlier evaluation [4] used a dataset of the listening histories of music tracks from Last.fm and they found that the tag-based recommendations yielded by the RWR method had higher accuracy.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We used the AP and mean average precision (MAP) to evaluate the recommendation lists produced, which were also used in previous studies [1], [4].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Zhen et al. analyzed the tags assigned by users with a probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) method [3].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{sup:13} Next, three human experts had a discussion and they classified the SAs into two or more SCs, according to the procedure described in Section 3.1.2.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This algorithm was described in previous studies [34], [35].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Parameter settings</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For example, “excellent” and “wonderful” are distinct words and previous methods have treated these words as different SAs, although they have similar meanings.</a>
