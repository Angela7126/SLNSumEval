<a href="#1" id="1">Semi-supervised combination of experts</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The product was available at around {a mathematical formula}1:30pm local time, at the overpass time of Aura satellite.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">On the other hand, the number of unlabeled data points is orders of magnitudes larger.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is particularly important for the largest continents of Asia and Africa, where the density of AERONET sites is very low and labeled data are extremely scarce.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this section we describe the details of the proposed semi-supervised aggregation algorithm.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">RMSE is defined as follows,{a mathematical formula} where the sum is over N labeled data points from the test set.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, in North America, thanks to a relative abundance of AERONET sites, the number of labeled data points can exceed a thousand every year, while in Africa and parts of Asia there are very few AERONET sites, and the number of labeled data points could be measured in tens every year.</a>
