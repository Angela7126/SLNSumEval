<a href="#1" id="1">Finally, the PA algorithm performs the worst on all the datasets under varied C values.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Online Transfer Learning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this section, we evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed OTL technique for three sets of experiments: (i) homogeneous OTL for classification tasks, (ii) heterogeneous OTL for classification tasks, and (III) application of OTL for concept-drifting online learning tasks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This shows that it is important for studying knowledge transfer in an OTL task.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Similarly, for fair comparison, we set the parameter C to 5 for all the algorithms on all the datasets.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">□ Online Transfer Learning across heterogeneous domains</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the optimization problem(6), its solution can be expressed as follows:{a mathematical formula}where{a mathematical formula}τt=min⁡{C,4γ1γ2ℓtz1,tγ2+z2,tγ1}and{a mathematical formula}ℓt=ℓ(w1,t,w2,t;t).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, a universal classifier might not be always optimal for every individual as different persons may have different opinions on the definition of spam.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These datasets are the same as those used in previous homogeneous classification tasks.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As a summary, this paper addresses two challenging scenarios: (i) OTL on homogeneous domains, and (ii) OTL across heterogeneous domains.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Thus, we haves{a mathematical formula} Combining the above fact with Proposition 1, we have{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Σv=∑t=1Tℓ⁎(Π(v⊤xt),Π(yt)) and {a mathematical formula}Σw=∑t=1Tℓ⁎(Π(wt⊤xt),Π(yt)).</a>
