<a href="#0" id="0">When {a mathematical formula}sn−1 was expanded to become permanently closed in the forward direction {a mathematical formula}sn was generated via an optimal path (in lines 14 and 18, {a mathematical formula}gF(n)+cost(n,c)=d(start,sn−1)+cost(sn−1,sn)=d(start,sn)).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">MM0 will not expand any node n with {a mathematical formula}gF(n)={a mathematical formula}12C⁎ (e.g. {a mathematical formula}S2) so N′D is half the size of NDU.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Delayed solution detection (DSD) refers to any approach that does not perform solution check immediately, but does perform the check before any state with larger f-cost is expanded.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}C⁎ is the cost of an optimal solution, i.e. the distance from {a mathematical formula}start to {a mathematical formula}goal.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The following establishes MMe's properties P1 and P2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We first look at node expansions in Tables 3.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">On each iteration MM expands a node with priority C.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Suppose it was {a mathematical formula}start (analogous reasoning applies if {a mathematical formula}goal was expanded on the first iteration).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">So, with DSD and the MMe priority rule, PEMM will terminate with the suboptimal solution cost 2.5.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">None of the search algorithms in this paper expands a state in RD, so only 5 regions will enter our discussions.</a>
