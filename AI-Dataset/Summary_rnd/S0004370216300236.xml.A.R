<a href="#0" id="0">We believe that Property 4 is an adequate criterion of optimality for hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula}Θj⁎ since, if it holds, {a mathematical formula}Θj⁎ must approximate the true type spaces {a mathematical formula}Θj+ in a way which allows HBA to plan (almost) as accurately – in terms of solving the task – as the “ideal” HBA in X which always knows the true types.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The beliefs and types are in turn utilised in a planning procedure to find an action which maximises our expected payoffs with respect to our beliefs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Fig. 5 shows that the prior beliefs had consistent performance effects across a wide variety of scenarios.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is easy to see that the correlated posterior would learn the correct type distribution in Example 5.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Similarly, the weighting schemes max / min assign {a mathematical formula}wk=1 for the first k that maximises / minimises {a mathematical formula}zkτ, and 0 otherwise.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These beliefs are updated based on the observed actions, and each player chooses an action which is expected to maximise the payoffs received by the player, given the current beliefs of the player.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Unfortunately, since we do not know {a mathematical formula}θj+, we cannot directly answer this question.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">□</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In fact, {a mathematical formula}θA is fully deterministic while {a mathematical formula}θAB is uniformly random, hence the average stochasticity in the centre of the spectrum {a mathematical formula}[0,1].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In fact, in our experiments, HBA often learned the true type after only 3 to 5 rounds, and in most cases in under 20 rounds.</a>
