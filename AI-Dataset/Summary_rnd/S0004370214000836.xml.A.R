<a href="#0" id="0">As an example of a polynomial kernel, consider the k-Vertex Cover problem, which, for a graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) and an integer parameter k, is to decide whether there is a set S of at most k vertices such that each edge from E has at least one endpoint in S. Buss' kernelization algorithm for k-Vertex Cover (see [14]) computes the set U of vertices with degree at least {a mathematical formula}k+1 in G. If {a mathematical formula}|U|>k, then reject the instance, i.e., output a trivial No-instance (e.g., the graph {a mathematical formula}K2 consisting of one edge and the parameter 0), since every vertex cover of size at most k contains each vertex from U. Otherwise, if {a mathematical formula}G∖U has more than {a mathematical formula}k(k−|U|) edges, then reject the instance, since each vertex from {a mathematical formula}G∖U covers at most k edges.</a>
