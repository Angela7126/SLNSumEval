<a href="#0" id="0">A simple instance of the first of these variants of Theorem 16 is Arrow's Theorem for weak orders (i.e., binary relations that are reflexive, transitive, and complete).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Background: Arrow's Theorem for preference aggregation</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Pini et al., 2009Any Arrovian aggregation rule for preferences—when modelled as preorders that have maxima or minima—over three or more alternatives must be a dictatorship.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This thus amounts to aggregating several graphs that are equivalence relations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, exactly the individuals in {a mathematical formula}C1 accept {a mathematical formula}e1, exactly those in {a mathematical formula}C2 accept {a mathematical formula}e2, and exactly those in {a mathematical formula}C1∩C2 accept {a mathematical formula}e3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Frame validity and global truthConsider the frame {a mathematical formula}G=〈V,E〉, with {a mathematical formula}V={x,y,z,w}, shown in Fig. 4.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Recent work has addressed the challenge of aggregating several abstract argumentation frameworks from a number of angles, e.g., by proposing concrete aggregation methods grounded in work on belief merging [34], by investigating the computational complexity of aggregation [35], and by analysing what kinds of profiles we may reasonably expect to encounter in this context [36].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If no individual graph includes {a mathematical formula}(x,x), then groundedness ensures the same for the collective graph.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let us briefly recapitulate where we are at this point.</a>
