<a href="#0" id="0">A possibility result establishes that every aggregation rule belonging to a certain class of rules (typically defined in terms of certain axioms) is collectively rational with respect to all graph properties that satisfy a certain meta-property.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An impossibility result, on the other hand, establishes that it is impossible to define an aggregation rule belonging to a certain class that would be collectively rational with respect to any graph property that meets a certain meta-property — or that the only such aggregation rules would be clearly very unattractive for other reasons.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The central idea here is that every logic is defined by a consequence relation between formulas.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, given a set of formulas, we can think of a logic {a mathematical formula}L as the graph corresponding to the consequence relation defining {a mathematical formula}L. Aggregating several such graphs then gives rise to a new logic.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, this is an instance of our graph aggregation problem, except that for the case of logic aggregation it is more natural to model the set of vertices as being infinite.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The first such axiom is an independence condition that requires that the decision of whether or not a given edge e should be part of the collective graph should only depend on which of the individual graphs include e. This corresponds to well-known axioms in preference and judgment aggregation [5], [17].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In social choice theory, an impossibility theorem states that it is not possible to devise an aggregation rule that satisfies certain axioms and that is also collectively rational with respect to a certain combination of properties of the structures being aggregated (which in our case are graphs).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In our discussion of Example 11, we concluded that the majority rule is not collectively rational with respect to seriality, which in the terminology of Definition 26 is expressed as the majority rule not being frame collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula} ◇ (p ∨ ¬p), a modal formula that corresponds to seriality.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">On the other hand, by Fact 5, the majority rule is frame collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p, corresponding to reflexivity.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">But note that the majority rule is not model collectively rational with respect to the same formula {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For example, the aggregation rule F that returns the full graph in case all individual graphs satisfy {a mathematical formula} ◇ (p ∨ ¬p), and the empty graph otherwise, is model collectively rational but not world collectively rational.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Moreover, Example 14 can be used to show the strict implication in item (ii), since it concerns an aggregation rule that is frame collectively rational with respect to modal formula {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p but not model collectively rational with respect to the same formula.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Thus, frame collective rationality is the least demanding of our three notions of collective rationality and world collective rationality is the most demanding.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence, negative results are strongest when formulated for frame collective rationality, while positive results are strongest when formulated for world collective rationality.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Unlike in Section 2.5, where we proved a number of simple possibility results for collective rationality at the level of frames for specific graph properties, the following results apply to all graph properties that can be expressed as modal integrity constraints meeting certain syntactic restrictions.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Recall that a representative-voter rule is an aggregation rule F that is such that for every profile E there exists an individual {a mathematical formula}i ⋆ ∈ N such that {a mathematical formula}F(E)=Ei ⋆ (see Definition 7).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Proposition 26 is related to a result for binary aggregation characterising the representative-voter rules as those binary aggregation rules that are collectively rational with respect to all propositional integrity constraints [16].</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Interestingly, for graph aggregation and modal integrity constraints, we do not obtain such a result; the converse of Proposition 26 does not hold, as demonstrated by the following example.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Also, to simplify the statements of theorems, when in this section we speak of “ aggregation rules for X ” , with X being some family of graphs, we are referring to aggregation rules that are collectively rational with respect to the graph properties characterising X.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">For example, Arrow's Theorem speaks about aggregation rules for weak orders, i.e., aggregation rules that are collectively rational with respect to the three graph properties defining weak orders.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In the economics literature, and thus in essentially all classical contributions to social choice theory, preferences are usually assumed to be complete.</a>
