<a href="#0" id="0">The first clear trend we observe in these results is that it is possible to converge to a Ε -stable health state without finding all diagnoses even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The results show that increasing Ε results in a lower quality health state.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This demonstrates the expected tradeoff between the number of diagnoses used to generate a health state and its quality.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Indeed, we already observed this tradeoff for the wasted effort metric in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that while the results showed that the health state obtained using all the diagnoses is better than the one obtained with fewer diagnoses on average, there are individual observations where adding more diagnoses do not improve the health state quality.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Such an example was shown in Table 5, where {a mathematical formula}H3 was better than health states generated with more diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Considering the results in Table 9, Table 10, we observe that in practice the difference in quality between Oracle value and the health state obtained using all the diagnoses ({a mathematical formula} Ε =0) is relatively small.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A small fraction of the diagnoses is needed to generate a health state that has almost the same quality as the health state generated by all diagnoses, for all the proposed quality metrics (wasted effort, AUC, and Euclidean distance).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Moreover, a high-quality health state can be found with only a subset of all minimal cardinality diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Table 13, Table 14 show the ratio of minimal cardinality diagnoses (where 1 corresponds to all minimal cardinality diagnoses) required on average, to reach a Ε -stable health state using AUC and Euclidean metrics respectively.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As can be seen, even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1, only a fraction of the minimal cardinality diagnoses are needed to reach a Ε -stable health state.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, only 17% of the minimal cardinality diagnoses are needed to generate a health state that is Ε -stable for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 for the 74181 system under the Euclidean distance metric (Table 14).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Note that the values are normalized by the total number of the minimal cardinality diagnoses and therefore they are higher than the values presented in Table 6, Table 7 which are normalized by all diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Although the proposed online stopping condition is very simple, the results in Table 15, Table 16 show that the resulting values for {a mathematical formula} Δ =0.1 are almost exactly the same as those obtained for health states generated from all diagnoses ({a mathematical formula} Δ =0).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In some cases, the health state obtained by the online stopping condition is even better than the health state of all diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The health state found when using the online stopping is also comparable to the quality obtained by the Ε -stable health state for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 (presented in Table 9, Table 10).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">[14] proposed a novel SAT-based approach to compute minimal cardinality diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">A diagnosis algorithm based on a greedy stochastic approach was also proposed [24].</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">All these DAs may potentially return a large set of diagnoses.</a>
