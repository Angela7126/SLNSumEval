<a href="#0" id="0">On the other hand, when competitions are based on real interaction in the physical world, replicating the results off-line and directly comparing different systems is no longer possible, since exact replication of the physical environment and the phenomena occurring during the competition is impossible and/or very expensive in terms of space, time, and economic cost.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, advances of RoboCup@Home are measured in terms of the effectiveness of the robotic systems (tested during the competition) in performing tasks and services that are relevant for helping non-expert users in daily activities in a domestic scenario, taking into account the discussed limitations of the difficulty of the environment.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Some studies have measured task complexity [15] and two main classes of approaches have been considered: subjective methods, where the difficulty of a task is measured by involving users who are asked to accomplish the task, and objective methods, where such features as the number of components and the relationship between them are identified and measured.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In summary, by monitoring the results provided by the data collected from the team scores, the competition organizers can check the progress of the results over the years, control the average scores and the standard deviation of each functionality, and make strategic decisions to change the rules to adjust the difficulty of the tasks and the functionalities based on the desired goals of the competition.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In principle, basic (2D) navigation problems is considered to be solved and in practice both the teams and the tests in the competition focus on particular problems that arise in domestic service robotics: navigation in highly dynamic environments (e.g., following a particular person through a crowd) or collision avoidance in complex scenes (requiring 3D perception).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Even though many steps have addressed the former (e.g., releasing packages under ROS and working on a special distribution for collecting all components for RoboCup@Home), the latter still remains a matter for future work (for example, defining a Standard Platform that has been proven to considerably increase the interest of other research groups in other RoboCup leagues â€” especially in soccer).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Provide a good balance between pre-defined tests and open demonstrations.We identified the importance of providing a good balance between pre-defined tests, where the desired skills need to be shown in desired robustness and efficiency, and open demonstrations, where teams can show cutting edge research results and problems that have not yet been addressed in the design of pre-defined tests.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The conducted statistics and evaluation of scores (and the subsequent amendments of the rules that define the competition) show that RoboCup@Home is on track to support integrated robotic systems that safely interact with environments and people.</a>
