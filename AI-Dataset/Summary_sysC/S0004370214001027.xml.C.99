<a href="#0" id="0">Specifically, this article addresses the problem of computing an irredundant subformula of a given CNF formula — that is, a subformula {a mathematical formula}E of {a mathematical formula}F that has exactly the same set of models as {a mathematical formula}F and is minimal in the sense that removal of any clause from {a mathematical formula}E violates this property.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Such subformula {a mathematical formula}E will be referred to as a Minimal Equivalent Subformula (MES) of {a mathematical formula}F. Intuitively, an MES of {a mathematical formula}F constitutes the result of removal of all redundant clauses from {a mathematical formula}F — these are the clauses whose removal does not change the set of models of {a mathematical formula}F.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this case, rather than terminating the process, clauses with the smallest number of satisfied literals are selected, the satisfied literals are flipped, and again one checks whether the formula has a single falsified clause.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As demonstrated in Section 7, this improved model rotation is very effective for redundancy removal.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As argued in Section 3.1, although MUS extraction algorithms can be modified for MES extraction, clause set refinement [21], [22], [23] cannot be used.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As noted earlier, MES algorithms based on adapting existing MUS algorithms are unable to implement clause set refinement, and so cannot drop {a mathematical formula}k(k − 1)/2 clauses after the second SAT solver call.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}T be any subset of clauses of {a mathematical formula}F — we refer to clauses of {a mathematical formula}T as target clauses, and to the set {a mathematical formula}T itself as a chunk of {a mathematical formula}F. The incremental reduction is based on the observation that in group-MUS approach the redundancy of any target clause {a mathematical formula}c ∈ T can be established by analyzing c with respect to {a mathematical formula}CNF(¬T) rather than {a mathematical formula}CNF(¬F).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If a literal l is a backbone literal, adding this literal as a unit clause to {a mathematical formula}F does not change the models of {a mathematical formula}F. Hence, whenever a backbone-computation algorithm detects that l is a backbone, it adds it to {a mathematical formula}F, which will help future SAT calls.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As it is the case with the application of model rotation in the group-MUS setting, the algorithm must be adjusted so that it constructs new assignments that satisfy all clauses of the currently falsified group, and the group {a mathematical formula}D.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Noteworthy is the fact that the don't care group {a mathematical formula}D=CNF(¬F) used in Proposition 2 to construct the group-CNF formula {a mathematical formula}RF(E) from a subformula {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ F does not need to include the negation of the don't care group on the formula used as an input to the group-MES computation problem.</a>
