<a href="#0" id="0">Then the conflict is {a mathematical formula}{Re2+,Re23+}, and the new diagnosis set is {a mathematical formula}{Re2+,Re23+}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The new diagnosis set is then {a mathematical formula}{Re2+}, and a unique diagnosis is achieved.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A diagnosis model defined with these residuals is diagnosable when both fault signatures and residual orderings are used (without orderings, faults {a mathematical formula}Re1+, {a mathematical formula}Re2+, and {a mathematical formula}Re3+ have all the same signatures and cannot be distinguished from one another).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The diagnosis model {a mathematical formula}S is split into n diagnosis submodels {a mathematical formula}S1,S2, … ,Sn, where each diagnosis submodel gets a subset of the fault set, a subset of the measurement set, and a subset of the residual set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that global correctness enforces the constraint that the set of diagnosis submodels covers all faults, i.e., that each fault {a mathematical formula}f ∈ F is contained in at least one {a mathematical formula}Fi.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To keep local diagnosers as small as possible, we will enforce a stricter constraint that each fault is contained in exactly one {a mathematical formula}Fi, so that every fault has exactly one diagnosis submodel that is responsible for it.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">That is, a diagnosis submodel {a mathematical formula}Si is globally diagnosable if all the faults {a mathematical formula}Fi are distinguishable from every other fault in F, i.e., all other faults in S, using only the residuals in {a mathematical formula}Ri.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This diagnosis submodel is not globally diagnosable, because faults not included in {a mathematical formula}Fi can produce the same observations as a fault in {a mathematical formula}Fi, as demonstrated in the previous example.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this paper, we focus on the problem where the diagnosis model {a mathematical formula}S is diagnosable and the user provides the initial distribution of the measurement and fault sets.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, given the residual set for the PCs (see Table 2), the diagnosis model is not diagnosable since fault {a mathematical formula}Re1+ cannot be distinguished from fault {a mathematical formula}Re12+, and fault {a mathematical formula}Re2+ cannot be distinguished from fault {a mathematical formula}Re23+.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For example, consider diagnosis submodel {a mathematical formula}S3.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Under the single fault assumption, the space of possible diagnosis sets is the power set of faults, {a mathematical formula}2F.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The same procedure to construct a correct centralized diagnoser applies to constructing a local diagnoser, as we simply use the diagnosis submodel with the local fault set {a mathematical formula}Fi and local residual set {a mathematical formula}Ri to obtain {a mathematical formula}DFi,Ri ⁎ .</a>
