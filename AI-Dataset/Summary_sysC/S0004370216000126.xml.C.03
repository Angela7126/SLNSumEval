<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula} The model is identical to the one for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal, except for the cost function and the functions {a mathematical formula}hkmax that define the system behavior.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The output for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax is a vector of binary variables ({a mathematical formula}effk=1 iff core k has “ high ” efficiency), hence in this case the Empirical Model is a classifier.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the remainder of this section we will present models for the core combinatorial structure of the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal and the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax, using a variety of optimization techniques (LS, MINLP, CP, and SMT).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Core model for Local Search The Local Search model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is identical to the base model presented in Section 3, and reported here for convenience:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula} where we recall that n is the number of jobs and m is the number of cores.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Analogously, the LS model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax is:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Core model for MINLP A MINLP model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal can be obtained from the base model by linearizing the objective function:</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula} We did not design a MINLP model for our second example problem, because we have not defined a technique for encoding in MINLP a Decision Tree, i.e.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">the Empirical Model that we employ for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax (see Section 7).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Core model for CP We have designed CP models for the two dispatching problems presented in Section 3.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The full model for {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is as follows:</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax is identical, except for the cost function and the definition of the efficiency variables:</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Core model for SMT We did not design an SMT model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal, because the Empirical Model that we employ in this case is a Neural Network and we have not devised a technique for embedding ANNs in SMT.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We did however define an SMT model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In the model we represent the mapping decisions via integer variables {a mathematical formula}xi,k such that {a mathematical formula}xi,k=1 iff job i runs on core k, similarly to what was done for LS and MINLP.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Empirical models for the{a mathematical formula}WDPbal We used Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the Empirical Model of the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal, for several reasons.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">With the aim to evaluate this approach, we have devised a linear model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal based on the features from Section 7.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We have employed the model fitting approach only for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal problem.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Results for the{a mathematical formula}WDPbal We obtained a LS approach based on the ACPI model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal by inserting the {a mathematical formula}hACPI(x) function into the core Local Search model from Section 6.</a>
