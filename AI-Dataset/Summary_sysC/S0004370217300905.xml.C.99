<a href="#0" id="0">The only previously existing bidirectional search algorithm guaranteed to meet in the middle is therefore Nicholson's [47].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is not a heuristic search algorithm, but, when {a mathematical formula}hF and {a mathematical formula}hB are consistent, it can be made to exactly simulate heuristic search by transforming the edge costs in the state space to take into account the heuristic values, as follows [30].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This will also happen with MM when {a mathematical formula}pr(n)=f(n) for all nodes, since in that case MM's forward search will be identical to A*'s.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, if the heuristic is sufficiently weak that {a mathematical formula}pr(n)=2g(n)[+ Î• ] for many nodes, MM can do exponentially fewer node re-expansions than A*.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}hB(goal) (not shown) is 23, which is larger than any {a mathematical formula}prminF-value that occurs during search after {a mathematical formula}start is expanded, so on this graph MM only searches in the forward direction, the same as A*.</a>
