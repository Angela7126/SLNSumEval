<a href="#0" id="0">Planning is motivated by acting.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Most of the existing work on automated planning underestimates the reasoning and deliberation needed for acting; it is instead biased towards path-finding methods in a compactly specified state-transition system.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Researchers in this AI field have developed many planners, but very few actors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We believe this is one of the main causes of the relatively low deployment of automated planning applications.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we advocate a change in focus to actors as the primary topic of investigation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Actors are not mere plan executors: they may use planning and other deliberation tools, before and during acting.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This change in focus entails two interconnected principles: a hierarchical structure to integrate the actor ʼ s deliberation functions, and continual online planning and reasoning throughout the acting process.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the paper, we discuss open problems and research directions toward that objective in knowledge representations, model acquisition and verification, synthesis and refinement, monitoring, goal reasoning, and integration.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Planning is nicely formalized from an AI point of view, e.g., as a mapping from abstract domains and problems into plans, while acting is much harder to formalize.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Hierarchically organized deliberation.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Regardless of the actor ʼ s internal architecture, it will view, prepare, and carry out its actions hierarchically.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Each action in a plan may be a task that may need further refinement and planning, which will usually be done online (see below) and may require different representations, tools, and techniques from the ones that generated the task.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Such a hierarchical deliberation process differs significantly from hierarchical planning techniques (e.g., HTN planning) for reducing the search complexity of offline, non-heterogeneous plan generation.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">descriptive models of actions and environments that are elaborate enough to allow for the synthesis of complex skills, possibly making use of domain-specific knowledge;</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">refine a task or an abstract action into lower level actions and primitives;</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">knowledge representations for needed models;</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">synthesis techniques required;</a>
