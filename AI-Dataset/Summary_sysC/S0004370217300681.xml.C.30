<a href="#0" id="0">(III) We develop a data clustering method based on the proposed HML-RF model by measuring pairwise similarity between visual samples for accurately discovering the semantic global group structure of all visual data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">(IV) We design three HML-RF tree structure driven tag prediction algorithms to recover missing tags for completing the local tag concept structure of individual visual data instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">missing tag completion) using tagged visual data, tag correlation and hierarchy, and random forest models.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Compared with these existing methods above, the proposed approach in this work is capable of jointly considering interactions between visual and tag data modalities, tag abstractness hierarchical structure and tag statistical correlations within a unified single model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This task is known as tag completion[5].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Intuitively, the potential benefit of HML-RF for tag completion is due to semantic neighbourhoods over data samples formed during the model training phase (Section 3.2).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">More specifically, as data splits in HML-RF consider both correlations between visual features and tags, and dependencies between tags in abstractness hierarchy and statistics, visually similar neighbour samples (e.g.</a>
