<a href="#0" id="0">1, the learning framework consists of four steps: 1) Base training: training a baseline system using annotated data and base features; 2) Processing: using the baseline system to annotate a large amount of raw sentences and obtain auto-labeled data; 3) Feature bucketing: performing feature transformation from base features to meta features; 4) Final training: training a new system with both the base and meta features.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The key step of the framework is feature bucketing, in which we use a transformation function to group the base feature instances from automatically annotated data into clusters, and define a set of meta features based on the clusters.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The transformation function for a base feature {a mathematical formula}fb generated from {a mathematical formula}Ti is defined as follows,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}R(fb) is the position index of {a mathematical formula}fb in the sorted list {a mathematical formula}L(Ti), “ Others ” is defined for the base features that are not included in the list, and TOP10 and TOP30 refer to the position numbers of top 10% and top 30%, respectively.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The results show that our meta parser outperforms most of the previous systems and obtain the comparable accuracy with the best result of Suzuki11 [44] which combine the clustering-based word representations of [14] and a condensed feature representation.</a>
