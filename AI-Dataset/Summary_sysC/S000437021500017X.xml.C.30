<a href="#0" id="0">From the set of observations streams generated by the input exploratory options, Curious Dr. MISFA learns a slow feature abstraction (say {a mathematical formula} Î¦ i) corresponding to the estimated easiest-yet-unlearned exploratory option stream (say {a mathematical formula}xj).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each target option learned is added to the target-option set {a mathematical formula}OL and the learning process iterates until all the learnable exploratory option streams are encoded.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since the expected behavior of Curious Dr. MISFA ensures that the Constraints (1), (2), (3) are satisfied [47] and the learned target-option's policy satisfies Constraint (4), the target-option set {a mathematical formula}OL, at any time t, therefore satisfies the required constraints.</a>
