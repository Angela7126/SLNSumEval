<a href="#0" id="0">We introduce new planning methods to handle these challenges, and demonstrate our approach using a real application domain: voltage control in Alternating Current (AC) electrical networks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Here we present, in detail, the treatment of a specific example: the management of voltages over time, within an AC power system, given predicted patterns of demand and generation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this context, given a distribution network and the predicted future demand and generation profiles, AI planning is used to decide which operations to apply to the power system, at what times, to maintain the voltage within the desired bounds.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An important difference between this and the benchmark domains considered so far in planning, is that the calculation of the numeric quantities requires the solution of a set of non-linear (in this case, power flow) equations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These problems are interesting for planning if the control actions take a significant amount of time relative to variations generated by the background processes (or, equivalently, if the control system is slow to react to changes in the background processes), or if the BTMP appears in the context of additional goals that require discrete causal reasoning alongside the management of the trajectory constraints.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given background load and generation profiles over the period, and safety constraints on maximum and minimum voltages, the planning problem is to manipulate network components, such as transformers, in time to interact with background profiles in such a way that the voltages at the busbars of the network always remain within their specified safety bounds.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The power of the abstraction is that the planner knows that it is applying an action that changes the network state, and can access the values of mixed metric expressions that are affected by the solver, but does not require a declarative description of the effects of those changes on the network.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">An instantaneous state transition triggered by action a, {a mathematical formula}effect(a) Φ , is defined as a function:{a mathematical formula} such that{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Whenever an action, a, is applied to a state, s, in a domain that includes an indirect effect function Φ , s is updated by the corresponding instantaneous state transition {a mathematical formula}effect(a) Φ (s).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Without infinity analysis, once the action can be applied in the TRPG, the end point would have to be applied at multiple time points (to obtain the accumulated effects of multiple applications of the increase effect) and these would be separated only by Ε since the relaxation would allow the same action end point to be applied repeatedly once its preconditions were satisfied ( Ε separation is required, because the TRPG must advance time by a minimum amount before constructing the next layer of the graph).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">While this narrowing of the TRPG at each TIF layer might provide additional heuristic information for some problems, by leading to longer relaxed plans, it does not help for BTMPs in which there are no mixed metric constraints in the preconditions of actions, since in this case the reachable actions are not influenced by the uncontrollable variables and the relaxed plan therefore cannot be affected either.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">An additional advantage to using an external solver, instead of trying to capture everything in the pddl model, is that we do not need to express variables in the domain that are not relevant to the search (such as impedance), but are necessary to perform the power flow calculations.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Since the over all constraint, in the constraint-check action, refers to the Network voltage, the computation of {a mathematical formula}P[v/ Α ] (Definition 11) exploits the external solver to determine the actual value of the Network voltage for the particular p-level and q-level load and generation settings.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The total violation {a mathematical formula}Vtot of a plan with respect to a load profile is measured as the sum of the violations of voltage level at each busbar:{a mathematical formula} where times is the set of timepoints in the execution trace resulting from applying the plan, or HTC approach, over the 24-hour period, and:{a mathematical formula} The quantity {a mathematical formula}Vtk is the total violation at time t and busbar k. The quantity {a mathematical formula}Vt,k is the voltage at time t at busbar k. As is standard in power systems, all voltage measurements are given in per unit volts, meaning that the voltages at a busbar are scaled relative to the nominal target voltage at that busbar.</a>
