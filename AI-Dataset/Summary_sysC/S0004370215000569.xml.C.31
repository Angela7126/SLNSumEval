<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we consider the important problem of redundant qualitative constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a set Γ of qualitative constraints, we say a constraint {a mathematical formula}(xRy) in Γ is redundant if it is entailed by the rest of Γ , i.e., removing {a mathematical formula}(xRy) from Γ will not change the solution set of Γ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is natural to ask when a network contains redundant constraints and how to get a non-redundant subset without changing the solution set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We call a subset of Γ a prime subnetwork of Γ if it contains no redundant constraints and has the same solution set as Γ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the next section we will show that, if Γ is an all-different constraint network over a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8, then {a mathematical formula} Γ c is the unique prime subnetwork of Γ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is quite surprising, as, in general, knowing that {a mathematical formula}(xRy) and {a mathematical formula}(uSv) are both redundant in Γ does not imply that {a mathematical formula}(uSv) is also redundant in {a mathematical formula} Γ ∖ {(xRy)}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this section, we assume {a mathematical formula}S is a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let Γ be an all-different network over {a mathematical formula}S. Because Γ satisfies (6), there is in particular no EQ constraint in Γ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We show that {a mathematical formula} Γ c, the core of Γ , is equivalent to Γ and hence the unique prime subnetwork of Γ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Using this result, we then further give a cubic time algorithm for computing the unique prime subnetwork of Γ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Suppose Γ is an RCC5/8 network over a distributive subalgebra {a mathematical formula}S and {a mathematical formula} Γ p its a-closure.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let {a mathematical formula}(xRy) and {a mathematical formula}(xSy) be the constraints from x to y in Γ and {a mathematical formula} Γ p respectively.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We prove that {a mathematical formula}(xRy) is redundant in Γ iff {a mathematical formula}(xSy) is redundant in {a mathematical formula} Γ p.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To this end, we need several lemmas.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The above result does not hold in general for non-distributive subalgebras.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For example, consider the RCC5 network Γ over {a mathematical formula}H5 shown in Fig.</a>
