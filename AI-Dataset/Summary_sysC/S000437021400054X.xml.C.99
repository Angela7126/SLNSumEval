<a href="#0" id="0">A model I of a normal logic program Π is an answer set under the standard answer set semantics if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(T Π I( ∅ ))if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − ))if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The conditions listed in Corollary 1 for an answer set of a normal logic program do not apply to a logic program with first-order formulas, because in the latter case the fixpoint {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) (resp.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − ))) would be a first-order theory instead of a set of ground atoms (e.g., see Example 7).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, these conditions suggest that instead of requiring each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I be included in {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )), answer sets of a logic program Π with first-order formulas can be defined by requiring that each{a mathematical formula}A ∈ Iis true in the fixpoint{a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − ))under the constraints{a mathematical formula}¬I − ; i.e., for each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I, {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This leads to the following principal definition.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In [27]'s formalism, ground aggregate atoms are essentially of the form{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}ai is a constant and each {a mathematical formula}Fi is a conjunction of ground atoms; an interpretation I satisfies A if {a mathematical formula}OP{ai|I satisfies Fi,1 ≤ i ≤ m} ⪰ b evaluates to true.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus A amounts in our framework to an aggregate atom{a mathematical formula}[27] showed that {a mathematical formula} Σ 2p-hardness of the FLP answer set semantics is present already for a ground normal logic program Π with polynomially computable ground aggregate atoms of form A, where m and the size of each {a mathematical formula}Fi are bounded by a constant k. However, for {a mathematical formula} Π ′ that is Π with all aggregate atoms A replaced by {a mathematical formula}A ′ , deciding the existence of a well-justified answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ lies in NP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Informally, this holds because in this case, in the fixpoint computation {a mathematical formula}Tf Π ′ Ii( ∅ ,¬I − ) all possible values of aggregation sets {a mathematical formula}SA ′ J for all interpretations J that satisfy {a mathematical formula}Tf Π ′ Ii( ∅ ,¬I − ) ∪ ¬I − can be determined in polynomial time (in the bound k).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As the semantics of a nonground normal logic program Π with aggregates is defined in terms of its grounding {a mathematical formula}ground( Π ), it is natural to view a nonground aggregate atom A as polynomially computable if each ground instance of A is polynomially computable.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Intuitively, since grounding causes an exponential blowup, the complexity of nonground normal logic programs with polynomially computable aggregates is exponentially higher than in the ground case, and thus complete for {a mathematical formula}NEXPNP resp.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">By Theorem 4, I is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}f Π I.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Thus I is a minimal model (standard answer set) of P in which A is true.The above proof shows that deciding whether a positive disjunctive logic program P has a standard answer set in which a given ground atom A is true can be reduced to deciding the existence of ordinary FLP resp.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">First note that if a logic program Π has no answer set, which means Π is inconsistent, then everything is cautiously true in Π under the answer set semantics, i.e., any {a mathematical formula}l ∈ HB Π trivially belongs to every answer set of Π .Since p is a fresh atom not occurring in Π , Π and {a mathematical formula} Π 1 by construction have the same FLP and well-justified FLP answer sets, none of which contains p (which would not be founded).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Therefore, if Π has no FLP or well-justified FLP answer set, then {a mathematical formula} Π 1 has no FLP or well-justified FLP answer set.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Thus, p trivially belongs to every FLP or well-justified FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 1.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Conversely, if p belongs to every FLP or well-justified FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 1, then {a mathematical formula} Π 1 must be inconsistent without FLP or well-justified FLP answer sets.</a>
