<a href="#0" id="0">This states that the set of plant feasible trajectories includes ones that go from {a mathematical formula}Rinit to {a mathematical formula}Rgoal over the entire duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">More specifically, if a trajectory starting anywhere in the initial region, {a mathematical formula}Rinit, of the activity (see Definition 8) and ending somewhere in the goal region, {a mathematical formula}Rgoal, at any duration d such that {a mathematical formula}l ≤ d ≤ u, is Plant Feasible, then the activity is temporally feasible in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This implies that the actuation limits imposed by the plant, and the operating constraints of the activity allow for actuation commands that can be used to control the linearized subsystem to the goal region from the initial region, at any duration in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Temporally Controllable ActivityGiven an activity and associated plant, and given a Valid Control Policy, P, for the activity, the activity is Temporally Controllable by P in the duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u] if the activity is Temporally Feasible in this range, and if all trajectories for the activity are consistent with (generated by) P. A trajectory is consistent with, or generated by P if for every state {a mathematical formula}x(k) in the trajectory, the subsequent state {a mathematical formula}x(k+1) results from applying P to {a mathematical formula}x(k).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Dispatchable QSPGiven a hybrid system represented by a Plant Model (Definition 1), and given a plan represented by a QSP (Definition 9), suppose that each activity{a mathematical formula}aiin the QSP is Temporally Controllable over the duration range{a mathematical formula}[li,ui].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let N be the Simple Temporal Network formed by combining the temporal constraints explicitly specified in the QSP, with the duration range temporal constraints{a mathematical formula}[li,ui].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If N is dispatchable[9], then a trajectory and schedule exist that satisfy the QSP (seeDefinition 13).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">QCPA Qualitative Control Plan (QCP) is a triple {a mathematical formula} 〈 E,Ac,Ct 〉 , where E is a set of events (Definition 7), {a mathematical formula}Ct is a set of temporal constraints on the events (Definition 10), and {a mathematical formula}Ac is a set of control activities (Definition 18).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In order for a QCP to be executed successfully, all activities in the QCP must be executed successfully (Definition 13).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If an activity has no feasible durations within the temporal [l, u] bounds specified for the activity, then the activity cannot be executed.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Therefore, the QCP cannot be executed successfully.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If, on the other hand, at least one feasible duration exists, then there is a non-empty intersection of the activity's initial region, its predecessor's goal region, and a cross-section region, as specified in Lemma 2.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The activity may begin if the initial state of the linearized sub-system lies within this intersection.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Further, by Lemma 1, a control law exists that transitions the state to the region for the subsequent cross section.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In this new cross section, the initial region and predecessor goal region constraints need not be checked since the activity is no longer in its initial state.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">By Lemma 1, each successive cross section has a control law that transitions the state to the subsequent cross section, ultimately ending in the goal region after the specified duration.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The executive's dispatcher component executes a QCP output by the plan compiler.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">To execute a QCP, the dispatcher must successfully execute each control activity.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The dispatcher accomplishes this by, in real time, monitoring plant state, and generating plant control inputs based on the appropriate QCP control policy for the current state and time.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">This causes the state trajectory of the linearized sub-systems to reach activity goal regions at acceptable times.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In this way, the dispatcher indirectly schedules start and finish events so that they are consistent with the temporal constraints of the QCP.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">This is a key difference between our dispatcher, and those of discrete activity execution systems [9], in which event times are set directly by the dispatcher.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">We focus now on the currently executing activities.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The dispatcher sets the schedule for a currently executing activity by deciding a target completion time for it that is within the activity's execution window.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">However, unlike discrete activity systems, which can simply set the occurrence of events so that they coincide with target completion times, our dispatcher must generate control inputs that guide the hybrid plant to its goal state at the target completion time.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Thus, the activity completion event time cannot simply be set, but rather, occurs as a consequence of the control policy applied to the plant dynamics.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Temporally Controllable Activity for Target Completion Time and Current StateAn activity is Temporally Controllable for Target Completion Time {a mathematical formula}tf from current state x if there exists a Valid Control Policy for Target Completion Time, {a mathematical formula}P(tf), that covers x.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Given the current state,x, and a set of valid cross sections of a currently executing Control Activity that started executing at time{a mathematical formula}ts, then for each cross section{a mathematical formula}cd, if{a mathematical formula}cdrepresents{a mathematical formula}P(tf,x)according toLemma 4, and if the set of cross sections is contiguous, then the activity is temporally controllable in the duration range{a mathematical formula}[l,u], where l is the minimum duration in the set, and u is the maximum.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Dispatchable Executing QCPGiven a Plant Model (Definition 1), a QCP (Definition 19) that is dispatchable according toTheorem 1, and the current statex, suppose that each activity{a mathematical formula}aiin the set of currently executing activities is Temporally Controllable in the duration range{a mathematical formula}[li,ui]for the current state according toLemma 5.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Let N be the Simple Temporal Network formed by combining the temporal constraints of the QCP before execution, with the duration range temporal constraints{a mathematical formula}[li,ui]for the currently executing activities.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">If N is dispatchable[9], then a trajectory and schedule exist that satisfy successful execution of the QCP.</a>
