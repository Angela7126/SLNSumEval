<a href="#0" id="0">Unfortunately, in PFGs, it is not possible to avoid brute-force search given an arbitrary partition function.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is because knowing the value of a coalition structure, {a mathematical formula}CS ∈ Π A, tells us nothing about the value of any other coalition structure, {a mathematical formula}CS ′ ∈ Π A:CS ′ ≠ CS, even if CS and {a mathematical formula}CS ′ have some elements (i.e., coalitions) in common.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, studying the coalition structure generation problem in PFGs is only interesting when additional assumptions are placed on the partition function w (see Section 9 for more details).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that, for every {a mathematical formula}I ∈ In, the value of the best coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π IA is always greater than, or equal to, the average value of all coalition structures in {a mathematical formula} Π IA.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, based on Theorem 6, we obtain a lower bound on the value of the best coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π IA, which is: {a mathematical formula}LBIA= ∑ i ∈ II(i)AvgiA.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, by replacing {a mathematical formula}AvgiA with {a mathematical formula}MaxiA in this expression, we obtain an upper bound{a mathematical formula}UBIA on the value of the best coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π IA, which is: {a mathematical formula}UBIA= ∑ i ∈ II(i)MaxiA.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Using these bounds, the algorithm computes an upper bound {a mathematical formula}UB ⁎ =maxI ∈ In ⁡ UBIA and a lower bound {a mathematical formula}LB ⁎ =maxI ∈ In ⁡ LBIA on the value of the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By computing {a mathematical formula}UB ⁎ , we can establish a bound on the quality of the best coalition structure found at any point in time, denoted by {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ ⁎ ; this bound is {a mathematical formula} Β =UB ⁎ /V(CS ⁎ ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">On the other hand, by computing {a mathematical formula}LB ⁎ , we can identify any subspaces that cannot possibly contain an optimal coalition structure, which are {a mathematical formula} Π IA:UBIA<LB ⁎ .</a>
