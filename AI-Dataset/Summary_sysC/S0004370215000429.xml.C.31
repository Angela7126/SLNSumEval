<a href="#0" id="0">The status of the Erd Ő s discrepancy conjecture for {a mathematical formula}C=2 has been settled by the authors of this article [30], [31] by encoding the problem as a propositional satisfiability problem and using state of the art SAT solvers to prove that the longest ±1 sequence of discrepancy 2 contains 1160 elements.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A {a mathematical formula}13900 long ±1 sequence of discrepancy 3 was also constructed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Notice that the general definition of discrepancy given in the introduction can be specialised in terms of partial sums of subsequences of a ±1 sequence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To simplify notation, we introduce an auxiliary notion of C-boundedness.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We say that a ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xl is C-bounded, for some {a mathematical formula}C>0 if {a mathematical formula}| ∑ i=1jxi| ≤ C, for all {a mathematical formula}j:0<j ≤ l.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then the discrepancy of a finite ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn of length n is a minimal C such that for every {a mathematical formula}d:1 ≤ d ≤ ⌊ nC+1 ⌋ the subsequence {a mathematical formula}xd,x2d … ,x ⌊ n/d ⌋ ⋅ d is C-bounded.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For an infinite sequence {a mathematical formula}(xn) its discrepancy is the supremum of discrepancies of all its initial finite fragments.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The proof of the fact that in every model I of {a mathematical formula} Φ (p1, … ,pl) we have {a mathematical formula}I(sjk)=1 if, and only if, {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1jI(pi) ≥ k can be extracted from [39].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It is based on the observation that the sum of the first j elements of the 0/1 sequence {a mathematical formula}I(p1), … ,I(pl) exceeds k if, and only if, either already the sum of the first {a mathematical formula}j − 1 elements exceeds k, or the sum of the first {a mathematical formula}j − 1 elements is k and the j-th element of the sequence is 1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Formulae (9) and (10) specify the border cases that the sum of the first j elements of any sequence cannot exceed j and that the sum of every initial subsequence is at least 0.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Finally notice that the fact that {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn is multiplicative does not imply that {a mathematical formula} − x1, … , − xn is, so symmetry breaking described in Proposition 11 is not applicable for multiplicative and completely multiplicative sequences.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Theorem 15</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">So we get a computer-aided proof of another sharp bound on the sizes of maximal sequences of bounded discrepancy.</a>
