<a href="#1" id="1">Given an MCS M, an inconsistency explanation of M is a pair {a mathematical formula}(E1,E2) of sets {a mathematical formula}E1,E2 ⊆ br(M) of bridge rules, such that for all {a mathematical formula}(R1,R2) where {a mathematical formula}E1 ⊆ R1 ⊆ br(M) and {a mathematical formula}R2 ⊆ br(M) ∖ E2, it holds that {a mathematical formula}M[R1 ∪ cf(R2)] ⊨ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By {a mathematical formula}E±(M) we denote the set of all inconsistency explanations of M, and by {a mathematical formula}Em±(M) the set of all pointwise subset-minimal ones.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Definition 9</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A refined diagnosis is a triple {a mathematical formula}(D1,D2,fg) consisting of sets of bridge rules {a mathematical formula}D1,D2 ⊆ br(M) and a body-reduction function {a mathematical formula}fg:br(M) → brref(M), such that the resulting MCS is consistent, i.e., {a mathematical formula}M[br(M) ∖ D1 ∪ fg(D2)] ⊭ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The set of all refined diagnoses is denoted by {a mathematical formula}D±,r(M).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To formalize this question, we introduce relevancy for inconsistency.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given an MCS M, a bridge rule {a mathematical formula}r ∈ br(M) is relevant for diagnosis (d-relevant) iff there exists a minimal diagnosis {a mathematical formula}(D1,D2) of M with {a mathematical formula}r ∈ D1 ∪ D2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Analogously, r is relevant for explanation (e-relevant) iff there exists a minimal explanation with {a mathematical formula}r ∈ E1 ∪ E2.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For a pair {a mathematical formula}R=(R1,R2) of sets of bridge rules compatible with M and a set U of contexts we say that R is U-headed iff {a mathematical formula}r ∈ (R1 ∪ R2) implies {a mathematical formula}Ch(r) ∈ U.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}MCSdm decides whether {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ Dm±(M), i.e., whether {a mathematical formula}(A,B) is a minimal diagnosis of M;</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">MCSe decides whether {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ E±(M), i.e., whether {a mathematical formula}(A,B) is an inconsistency explanation of M; and</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}MCSem decides whether {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ Em±(M), i.e., whether {a mathematical formula}(A,B) is a minimal inconsistency explanation of M.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">a program P ({a mathematical formula}I ⊨ P), iff {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ r for all {a mathematical formula}r ∈ P.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}PPE(M), it is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}fPPE(M)I and by Lemma 10 all rules of {a mathematical formula}TR14(M) ∪ ⋯ ∪ TR31(M) are in {a mathematical formula}fPPE(M)I, so I must be a minimal model of those rules.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For every {a mathematical formula}tr ∈ TR8(M) ∪ TR9(M) it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ tr since {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ tr and I agrees with {a mathematical formula}I ′ on atoms {a mathematical formula}e1,ne1,e2, and ne2.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For every {a mathematical formula}tr ∈ TR10(M) ∪ ⋯ ∪ TR13(M) it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ tr since {a mathematical formula}(R1,R2) ∈ Rg(E) and {a mathematical formula}I ′ consistently encodes {a mathematical formula}(R1,R2).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For every {a mathematical formula}tr ∈ TR14(M) it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ tr since {a mathematical formula}I ′ consistently encodes S.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">For every {a mathematical formula}r ∈ br(M) it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ tr15(r) since {a mathematical formula}Iapp ⊆ I ′ and {a mathematical formula}Iapp is defined such that {a mathematical formula}S| ⇝ r and {a mathematical formula}r ∈ R1 implies that {a mathematical formula}body(r) ∈ I ′ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">For every {a mathematical formula}r ∈ br(M) it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ tr16(r) since {a mathematical formula}body(r) ∈ I ′ implies {a mathematical formula}r ∈ R1, hence by {a mathematical formula}I ′ encoding {a mathematical formula}(R1,R2) it follows that {a mathematical formula}r1(r) ∈ I ′ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">For every head {a mathematical formula}(i:b) of a bridge rule it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ tr23(i,b), because: if {a mathematical formula}ini(b) ∈ I ′ for some {a mathematical formula}i ∈ ci(M), then by definition of {a mathematical formula}I ′ there exists {a mathematical formula}r ∈ app(bri(M ′ ),S) such that one of the following holds:</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">For every {a mathematical formula}tr ∈ TR25(M) ∪ ⋯ ∪ TR27(M) it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ tr since {a mathematical formula}I ′ is conflict-free and {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊭ BHEX(tr).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">For every {a mathematical formula}tr ∈ TR28(M) ∪ ⋯ ∪ TR31(M) it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊨ tr since {a mathematical formula}spoil ∉ I ′ .</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Therefore, all rules of {a mathematical formula}fPPE(M)I are satisfied and it follows that {a mathematical formula}I ′ is a model of {a mathematical formula}fPPE(M)I.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Since {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊂ I, I is not a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}fPPE(M)I, which contradicts that I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}PPE(M).</a>
