<a href="#0" id="0">Most important for the scope of this paper is that there are high-quality OMT solvers which, at least for the {a mathematical formula}LRA theory, can handle problems with thousands of hybrid variables.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the other hand, our framework aims at allowing learning and inference over hybrid continuous – discrete domains, where continuous and discrete variables are the output of the inference process.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">SMT is the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a (typically quantifier-free) first-order formula with respect to some decidable background theory{a mathematical formula}T, which can also be a combination of theories {a mathematical formula} ⋃ iTi.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider the following toy {a mathematical formula}LRA-formula Φ :{a mathematical formula} and the OMT({a mathematical formula}LRA) problem of finding the model of Φ (if any) which makes the value of cost minimum.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Overall, for the scope of this paper, it is important to highlight the fact that OMT solvers are available which, thanks to the underlying SAT and SMT technologies, can handle problems with a large number of hybrid variables (in the order of thousands, at least for the {a mathematical formula}LRA theory).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We consider the problem of learning from a training set of n complex objects {a mathematical formula}{(Ii,Oi)}i=1n, where each object {a mathematical formula}(I,O) is represented as a set of Boolean and rational variables:{a mathematical formula} We indicate Boolean variables using predicates such as {a mathematical formula}touching(i,j), and write rational variables as lower-case letters, e.g.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Each constraint {a mathematical formula} Φ k is either a Boolean- or rational-valued function of the object {a mathematical formula}(I,O).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Similarly, we refer to the cost of a rational-valued constraint {a mathematical formula} Φ k as {a mathematical formula}ck(I,O) ∈ Q.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The feature space representation of an object {a mathematical formula}(I,O) is given by the feature vector{a mathematical formula} Ψ (I,O), which is a function of the constraints.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Each soft constraint {a mathematical formula} Φ k has an associated finite weight {a mathematical formula}wk ∈ Q (to be learned from the data), while hard constraints have no associated weight.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Here the input I to the problem is the observed block {a mathematical formula}(x1,y1,dx1,dy1) while the output O is the generated block {a mathematical formula}(x2,y2,dx2,dy2).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In order to encode the set of constraints {a mathematical formula}{ Φ k} that underlie both the learning and the inference problems, it is convenient to first introduce a background knowledge of predicates expressing facts about the relative positioning of blocks.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The hard constraints represent the fact that the output O should be a valid block within the bounding box (all the constraints {a mathematical formula} Φ k are implicitly conjoined):{a mathematical formula} Then we require the output block O to “ touch ” the input block I:{a mathematical formula} Note that whenever this rule is satisfied, both conditions (i) and (ii) of the toy example hold, i.e.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Finally, we encode the cost function {a mathematical formula}cost=w1dx2+w2dy2, completing the description of the optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The input image I is seen as the set P of coordinates of the pixels belonging to the character, while the output O is a set of m directed segments {a mathematical formula}{(xib,yib,xie,yie)}i=1m.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Under this interpretation, we can informally write the inference problem as follows:{a mathematical formula} where the orientation term encodes information on the orientation of the segments which should be useful for computing the “ looking like ” condition.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For instance, {a mathematical formula}h2t(i,j) indicates that i is head-to-tail with respect to j, {a mathematical formula}h2h(i,j) that they are head-to-head:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} For a pictorial representation of the “ looking like an A ” constraint, see Fig.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For example, suppose we have an {a mathematical formula}8×8 image of an upper-case “ A ” , as in Fig.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">We evaluated LMT on the character drawing problem by carrying out an extensive experiment using a set of noisy B&W {a mathematical formula}16×20 character images.</a>
