<a href="#0" id="0">If each{a mathematical formula}hiis discretely convex, H is defined as in equation(5),sis the result ofAlgorithm 1, and eachFiltercall achieves domain consistency on the unary constraint given as argument, thenAlgorithm 3, Algorithm 4achieve domain consistency on{a mathematical formula}xj.First, we show that the value b used in each Filter call of lines 5 and 11 is{a mathematical formula} This is verified for the call in line 5 by equation (11) and the computed values of b and v. From now on, we only consider the case of the values v larger than {a mathematical formula}wj, i.e., Algorithm 3, the other case being symmetrical.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is obtained by instantiating the time complexity given in Table 7 for the special case with {a mathematical formula}p=c=O(1) as all parametric functions and procedures can be implemented in constant time, {a mathematical formula}s(h)=2 as each {a mathematical formula}hi function has 2 segments, and {a mathematical formula}s(H)=2 â‹… n as, in the worst case, the parameters r and s are all different.</a>
