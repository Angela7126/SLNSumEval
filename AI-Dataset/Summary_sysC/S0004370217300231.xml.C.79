<a href="#1" id="1">(22) the partition function can be computed from the full-inside mass at the top level ({a mathematical formula}d=1){a mathematical formula} With the similar derivation the partition function can also be computed from the full-outside mass at the bottom level ({a mathematical formula}d=D){a mathematical formula} In fact, we will prove a more general way to compute Z in Appendix B{a mathematical formula} for any {a mathematical formula}t ∈ [1,T] and {a mathematical formula}d ∈ [2,D − 1].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There is a recursion where the asymmetric inside mass ending at time j is computed from all the asymmetric inside masses ending at time {a mathematical formula}t − 1, for {a mathematical formula}t ∈ [i+1,j].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">There are special cases for the asymmetric inside mass: (1) when {a mathematical formula}i=j, we only have{a mathematical formula} and (2) when {a mathematical formula}d=D − 1, the sum over the index t as in Eq.</a>
