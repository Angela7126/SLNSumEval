<a href="#0" id="0">After constructing the pseudo tree, all agents assign values sequentially, starting with the root of the tree down to the leaves.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The assignments are performed only by agents holding a CPA, which is a message received from the agent's parent in the pseudo tree.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A CPA contains the Current Partial Assignment of all ancestors of the current agent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition, a CPA message contains an Upper Bound (UB) on the solution cost, and the {a mathematical formula}CPA_Cost, which is the accumulated cost of constraints between all assignments it contains.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When an agent {a mathematical formula}Ai extends the CPA with an assignment to its variable (the variable of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai is denoted {a mathematical formula}Xi), it sends a LB_Request message, containing a copy of the CPA, to all of its descendants in the pseudo tree.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">An agent {a mathematical formula}Aj receiving a LB_Request calculates a lower bound on the added cost caused by extending the CPA with an assignment to its variable.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It computes the value of {a mathematical formula}minvj ∈ Dj ⁡ ∑ Ak ∈ CPACost(vk,vj), where {a mathematical formula}Dj is the domain of {a mathematical formula}Xj, and {a mathematical formula}vk is the value assignment of {a mathematical formula}Xk in the received CPA.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This lower bound is sent back in a LB_Report message.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The agent {a mathematical formula}Ai which holds the original CPA can now check whether the sum of all of the reported costs added to the CPA cost exceeds the known UB.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If so, it will try to assign a different value to its variable, or send a Backtrack message to its parent if no value assignment is possible.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">If the sum of the LB_Report message and the {a mathematical formula}CPA_Cost does not exceed the upper bound (UB), the CPA is sent forward to the agent's children on the pseudo-tree.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">An agent sends forward a CPA to its children on the pseudo-tree in different ways, according to the number of children it has.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If the agent has a single child, then the CPA sent to its child is clear.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In this situation, the agent sends to its child a CPA with the UB currently known to it.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The cost on this CPA is equal to the cost that the sending agent received from its parent, plus the added cost of assigning a value to its variable.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In the case of a single child, the assigning agent waits for the response to its LB_Request before sending its CPA forward.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">If, on the other hand, the agent has more than one child, it effectively divides the problem into separate sub-problems, one for each of its children on the pseudo-tree.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In order to do so, it asynchronously sends them a CPA with {a mathematical formula}cost=0, and an upper bound that is computed separately for each child, as follows{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Ai is the sender and {a mathematical formula}Aj is the child.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">{a mathematical formula}Sub_Tree_LB(Ak,vi) is the currently best known lower bound on the cost of the sub tree rooted at each child {a mathematical formula}Ak ({a mathematical formula} ≠ Aj), given the partial assignment {a mathematical formula}CPA ∪ {vi}.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The best known {a mathematical formula}Sub_Tree_LB(Ak,vi) starts as the sum of all LB_Reports received from members of that sub tree.</a>
