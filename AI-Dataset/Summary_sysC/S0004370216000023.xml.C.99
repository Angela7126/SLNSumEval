<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}L, {a mathematical formula}W0, {a mathematical formula}W1, {a mathematical formula}W2 and {a mathematical formula}W3 be as stated in Example 1.4.Define K to be the theory {a mathematical formula}K=W0 and let ÷ be the transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction that is based on the preorder ⊑ on {a mathematical formula} ⋃ B ⊆ LK ⊥ B — the set of all remainders of K — defined as follows (where, as usual, ⊏ denotes the strict part of ⊑ ):{a mathematical formula}Now consider the sentences {a mathematical formula} Α =q, {a mathematical formula} Β =p and {a mathematical formula} Δ =p ∨ ¬q.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, it holds that {a mathematical formula} ‖ ¬ Α ‖ ={W1,W2}, {a mathematical formula} ‖ ¬ Β ‖ ={W2,W3} and {a mathematical formula} ‖ ¬ Δ ‖ ={W3}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, having in mind Observation 2.12, it follows that{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}Finally, according to the definition of ⊑ , it follows that:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}Now assume towards contradiction that there is a system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ ={W0} such that ÷ is the {a mathematical formula}S filtration-based multiple contraction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then it follows from (2) and (4) that {a mathematical formula}S ⋀ W1 ⊂ S ⋀ W2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Similarly, from (3) and (5) it follows that {a mathematical formula}S ⋀ W2 ⊂ S ⋀ W3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence,{a mathematical formula}Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">2 contains a possible graphical representation of the system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S, where the sets {a mathematical formula} ‖ ¬ Α ‖ and {a mathematical formula} ‖ ¬ Δ ‖ are highlighted.However, the {a mathematical formula}S filtration-based multiple contraction {a mathematical formula}÷S is such that {a mathematical formula}K÷S{ Α , Δ }=Th({W0,W1,W3}) and, therefore, according to (6), ÷ differs from {a mathematical formula}÷S.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus we can conclude that ÷ is not a spheres filtration-based multiple contraction.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">LetKbe a belief set such that the set{a mathematical formula}ML ∖ ‖ K ‖ contains more than one possible world,{a mathematical formula}Sbe an arbitrary system of spheres centred on{a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ and{a mathematical formula}÷Sbe a multiple contraction onKwhose definition is based on (i.e., depends on){a mathematical formula}S. Then the class of all such contraction function does not contain the class of (all) transitively relational partial meet multiple contractions, i.e.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let K be a belief set and {a mathematical formula}S be a system of spheres centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ , the multiple contraction function {a mathematical formula}÷S2 is defined, for any set of sentences B, as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} ⊑ S2 is the binary relation on {a mathematical formula}2ML defined by:{a mathematical formula}V ′ ⊑ S2V iff for all {a mathematical formula}W ∈ V there is some {a mathematical formula}W ′ ∈ V ′ such that {a mathematical formula}S ∧ W ⊆ S ∧ W ′ and for all {a mathematical formula}R ∈ V ′ there is some {a mathematical formula}S ∈ V such that {a mathematical formula}S ∧ S ⊆ S ∧ R.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Throughout this subsection we assume that K is a belief set, {a mathematical formula}S is a system of spheres centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ and {a mathematical formula}÷S1 and {a mathematical formula}÷S2 are the multiple contraction functions whose definitions we have introduced in the previous subsection.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">It does not hold in general that, given a belief setKand a system of spheres{a mathematical formula}Scentred on{a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ , the multiple contraction function{a mathematical formula}÷S1onKis identical to the multiple contraction function{a mathematical formula}÷S2onK.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">That is, for some belief setKthere is a system of spheres{a mathematical formula}Scentred on{a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ and a set of sentences A, such that{a mathematical formula}K÷S1A ≠ K÷S2A, i.e.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Then the multiple contraction{a mathematical formula}÷S1onKis a transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction.We start by recalling that {a mathematical formula}÷S1 is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} ⊑ S1 is the binary relation on {a mathematical formula}2ML defined by: {a mathematical formula}V ′ ⊑ S1V iff for all {a mathematical formula}W ∈ V there is some {a mathematical formula}W ′ ∈ V ′ such that {a mathematical formula}S ∧ W ⊆ S ∧ W ′ .Now let f be such that, for any set of sentences B, {a mathematical formula}f(H( 〈 B ∩ K 〉 ))={V ∈ H( 〈 B ∩ K 〉 ): for all V ′ ∈ H( 〈 B ∩ K 〉 ),V ′ ⊑ S1V}.It follows from Theorem 5.7 that to prove that {a mathematical formula}÷S1 is a transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction it is enough to show that f is a transitively relational propositional package selection function for {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .It follows immediately from its definition that f is a function, i.e.</a>
