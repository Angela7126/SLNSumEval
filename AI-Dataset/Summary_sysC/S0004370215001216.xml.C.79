<a href="#0" id="0">2.Though it becomes impossible to depict the geometry of a lex constraint when {a mathematical formula}n>3, one can easily imagine its general structure, and thus its complexity in the numerical context.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The following statement is required by Proposition 6: All elements of{a mathematical formula}x Σ are generated with the same number of symmetries of Σ , i.e.,{a mathematical formula}|{ Σ ∈ Σ :x Σ =y}|=|{ Σ ∈ Σ :x Σ =z}|, ∀ y,z ∈ x Σ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">hlex constraints can be adapted by changing the definition of the function Δ , making it closer and closer to lex constraints in the continuous context as true is mapped to smaller and smaller values {a mathematical formula} Δ ∈ (0,1], see Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Again, and similarly to most proposed lex encodings, the first and foremost reason why such encodings are not appropriate in the continuous context is that they come in factorial number with respect to the number of variables in the worst case, without an efficient (poly-time) method for generating them, and involve all the variables implied in the symmetry in a formula much more complex than rlex constraints.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A counter-productive performance occur for only 1 run out of the 68 experiments, the instance of problem Eiger at dimension {a mathematical formula}n=100, and the loss in solving time is {a mathematical formula}2% of 22.3 s, i.e., 0.3 s. A more detailed look at this problem reveals it has only a cyclic symmetry group (order n), very simple binary quadratic constraints and only two fully frontier solutions (see Section 5.2.1 for a detailed analysis of the influence of these features).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If the above assumptions hold, one can then conclude that the time to solve the problem without and with rlex should respectively be proportional to the initial domain volume and to the CS volume, yielding a gain equal to {a mathematical formula}| Σ |.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, in order to realize that no reduction at all is possible on the domain of any variable, each contracting operator must be applied once, i.e., only n for the minimal set in contrast with {a mathematical formula}n2 for the maximal set.</a>
