<a href="#0" id="0">A qualitative constraint network Γ is called minimal if for each constraint {a mathematical formula}(xRy) in Γ , R is the minimal (i.e., the strongest) relation between x, y that is entailed by Γ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Suppose{a mathematical formula} Γ ={viTijvj:1 ≤ i,j ≤ n}is a qualitative constraint network over{a mathematical formula}M. If Γ is weakly globally consistent, then it is minimal.For every pair of variables {a mathematical formula}vi,vj ({a mathematical formula}i ≠ j) and every basic relation Α in {a mathematical formula}Tij, it is clear that {a mathematical formula}{vi Α vj} is a consistent scenario of {a mathematical formula} Γ ↓ {vi,vj}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is co-NP-complete to decide if{a mathematical formula}(xRy)is redundant in Γ .First of all, we note that {a mathematical formula}(xRy) is redundant in Γ iff {a mathematical formula}( Γ ∖ {(xRy)}) ∪ {xRcy} is inconsistent, where {a mathematical formula}Rc is the complement of R. Since it is NP-complete to decide if an RCC5/8 network is consistent, we know this redundancy problem (i.e., the problem of determining if a constraint is redundant in a network) is in co-NP.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The following two lemmas show that a constraint {a mathematical formula}(xRy) in Γ is redundant iff R contains the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in {a mathematical formula} Γ ∖ {(xRy)}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Suppose Γ is a consistent RCC5/8 network and{a mathematical formula}(xRy)a constraint in Γ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Assume that W is the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in{a mathematical formula} Γ ∖ {(xRy)}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then{a mathematical formula}(xRy)is redundant in Γ if{a mathematical formula}R ⊇ W.Write {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ ≡ Γ ∖ {(xRy)}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For every path Π from x to y in {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ , we know {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ entails {a mathematical formula}(xCT( Π )y).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By the definition of W, this implies that {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ entails {a mathematical formula}(xWy).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Suppose {a mathematical formula}R ⊇ W.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It is clear that every solution of {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ also satisfies {a mathematical formula}(xRy), and therefore, {a mathematical formula}(xRy) is redundant in Γ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Note that {a mathematical formula}ci+1 is also in {a mathematical formula} Γ i.</a>
