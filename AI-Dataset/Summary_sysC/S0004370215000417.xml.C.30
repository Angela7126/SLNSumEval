<a href="#0" id="0">In this approach, after the relaxed problem has been solved, additional linear constraints are added to the problem which separate the current relaxed solution from the space of any valid integer solutions, i.e.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">any integer solution will respect the constraint but the current relaxed solution does not.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider for example the simple case in which it is deduced that an integer {a mathematical formula}X ≤ 7.2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As we know X to be integer, we can always add a cut of {a mathematical formula}X ≤ 7 as this will not remove any possible integer solution from the space, but does usefully remove the parts of the search space where X takes non-integer values between 7 and 7.2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The search for the relaxed solution and the addition of extra constraints alternates until no more cuts can be found.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If the variables in the relaxed solution are now integer the problem is solved, otherwise the problem branches as in the branch-and-bound algorithm.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the standard ILP formulation of the problem, cycles are ruled out through adding cluster cuts, which state that there should be no cycles formed from all elements of that cluster.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Having determined the cycles of this graph, one can simply take the set of nodes involved in each cycle and add a cluster cut to the problem for each of these sets.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Any cluster cut involving all the nodes in any cycle of G will separate the current relaxed solution.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, the converse does not hold; there exist cluster cuts that separate the current relaxed solution which do not correspond to cycles in G.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The convex hull of the problem with 3 nodes, {a mathematical formula}P3, was found using the lrs{sup:2} algorithm.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In this case, it transpires that {a mathematical formula}P3 consists of 17 facets; 9 lower bounds on the variables' values, the 3 limits on each node having one parent set, 4 cluster constraints, and a single extra constraint:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Following this set of experiments, the use of a number of extensions which are more parametric are assessed.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">These three extensions are the method by which cluster cuts are found, the point at which convex4 constraints are added and the use of close cuts.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In the previous experiments, we fix their behaviour to using the sub-IP and no cycle finding for identifying cluster cuts, no use of convex 4 cuts and no use of close cuts.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The constraints based on the convex hull of the 4 node BN polytope can be added to the problem initially or used as cutting planes.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In the case where they are used as cutting planes, they can be searched for whenever a solution needs separating or only when no efficacious cluster constraints can be found.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">As before, cycle finding with a maximum length of 6, followed by the sub-IP if necessary is used with the convex hull constraints added as cutting planes only when efficacious cluster cuts are not found.</a>
