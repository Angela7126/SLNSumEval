<a href="#1" id="1">Input: A KB {a mathematical formula}K and an axiom Φ of the same type as {a mathematical formula}K such that {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ Φ , and a set {a mathematical formula}K ⊆ P(K).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, {a mathematical formula}MP contains a MinA for Φ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Input: A KB {a mathematical formula}K and an axiom Φ of the same type as {a mathematical formula}K such that {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ Φ , and an axiom {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∈ K.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Question: Is there a MinA {a mathematical formula}M for Φ in {a mathematical formula}K such that {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∈ M?</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This in particular means that every MinA for Φ in {a mathematical formula}M must contain Ψ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Input: A KB {a mathematical formula}K and an axiom Φ of the same type as {a mathematical formula}K such that {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Output: The set of all MinAs for Φ in {a mathematical formula}K.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, if we can enumerate all immediate MinAs in {a mathematical formula}GT in output polynomial time, we will also be able to enumerate all MinAs in {a mathematical formula}T within the same complexity bound.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Input: A KB {a mathematical formula}K and an axiom Φ of the same type as {a mathematical formula}K such that {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ Φ , and a set of KBs {a mathematical formula}K ⊆ P(K).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Question: Is {a mathematical formula}K precisely the set of all MinAs for Φ in {a mathematical formula}K?</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Question: Is {a mathematical formula}M the first MinA w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Consider an ordering of the axioms in {a mathematical formula}K such that:</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Input: A KB {a mathematical formula}K and an axiom Φ of the same type as {a mathematical formula}K such that {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Output: The number of all MinAs for Φ in {a mathematical formula}K.</a>
