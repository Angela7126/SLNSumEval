<a href="#0" id="0">We show that the model checking problem for {a mathematical formula}RAL, i.e., the logic without any additional restrictions, remains undecidable over iRBMs (see Theorem 1 below).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The model checking algorithm for {a mathematical formula}pprRAL over iRBMs takes as input a model {a mathematical formula}M, formula Φ , and initial endowment Η , and labels the set of states {a mathematical formula}[ Φ ]M Η , where {a mathematical formula}[ Φ ]M Η ={q|M,q, Η ⊨ Φ } is the set of states satisfying Φ (see Algorithm 1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is, it is true for {a mathematical formula} Λ =(qi, Η i)i=1, … ,3(k − 1)+1, which is also an {a mathematical formula}A-computation pre-encoding.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">That is, {a mathematical formula} Η 3(k − 1)+1(1,Rr)= Η 3(k − 1)+1(2,Rr) for {a mathematical formula}r=1,2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider the {a mathematical formula}A-computation pre-encoding (where we simply consider how Λ has to be extended given the construction of the model){a mathematical formula} Now, a simple computation, taking into consideration the structure of the model, gives: {a mathematical formula} Η 3k+1(1,Rr)= Η 3(k − 1)+3(1,Rr)= Η 3(k − 1)+2(1,Rr)+Crk+Erk= Η 3(k − 1)+1(1,Rr)+Crk=IH Η 3(k − 1)+1(2,Rr)+Crk= Η 3(k − 1)+2(2,Rr)+Crk= Η 3(k − 1)+3(2,Rr)+Crk= Η 3k+1(2,Rr).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The proof is by induction on the structure of the formulae.Base case:{a mathematical formula}Case Φ =p_ for some {a mathematical formula}p ∈ Π : strategy({a mathematical formula}n,p) returns true iff {a mathematical formula}s(n) ⊨ p (by lines 2 – 3 in Algorithm 2) iff {a mathematical formula}s(n),e ′ ⊨ p for any {a mathematical formula}e ′ ∈ compatible(v(n)) (by the semantics of {a mathematical formula}RAL).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For the purpose of this proof, we assume that each interior node n in T has an additional function {a mathematical formula}a(n) which returns the action tuple of the proponent at {a mathematical formula}s(n); and the function {a mathematical formula}node(n,s, Α ,A) also assigns {a mathematical formula}a(n)= Α .For every leaf n of T, we have that {a mathematical formula}strategy(n, Ψ 2) returns true according to lines 8 – 9 of Algorithm 4.</a>
