<a href="#0" id="0">The direct coupling between knowledge and action also has undesirable implications for situated agents reasoning about their own knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a consequence of using regression to handle knowledge queries, one can only reason about knowledge if one has a situation term rooted in {a mathematical formula}S0, as the required query is:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given an explicit account of the observations made by each agent, the required semantics of the K relation are clear: {a mathematical formula}K(agt,s ′ ,s) must hold whenever {a mathematical formula}s ′ is legal, both s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ would result in the same view for the agent, and s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ are rooted at K-related initial situations:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These axioms suffice to ensure that knowledge behaves as we require: two situations will be related by {a mathematical formula}K(agt,s ′ ,s) if and only if they result in identical views for that agent, {a mathematical formula}s ′ is legal, and their root situations were initially related:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our previous work on the persistence condition meta-operator [19] discussed the advantages of this approach in detail, but its primary advantage is to make automated reasoning approachable at all – the alternative is second-order theorem proving against the full theory {a mathematical formula}D.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The proof proceeds by cases on situation s and its mechanics mirror the analogous Theorem 7 in [45], but with the addition of a persistence condition application.For notational clarity we define the abbreviation {a mathematical formula}PEO(agt, Φ ,o,s) (for “ persists under equivalent observations ” ) which states that Φ holds in all legal futures of s compatible with observations o:{a mathematical formula}First, note that we need only consider two cases: {a mathematical formula}do(c,s) and {a mathematical formula}S0.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We do not provide a regression rule for knowledge at other situation terms, so {a mathematical formula}R(Knows(agt, Φ ,s)) would leave the formula unchanged and the theorem is trivial.In the {a mathematical formula}do(c,s) case, by definition of the Knows macro we have:{a mathematical formula}Applying the successor state axiom from Eq.</a>
