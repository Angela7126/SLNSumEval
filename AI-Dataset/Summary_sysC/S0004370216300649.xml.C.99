<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we use the notion of modularity to define a new model of generation of random SAT instances with community structure, called Community Attachment.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For high values of modularity (i.e., clear community structure), we realistically model pseudo-industrial random SAT formulas.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This model also generates SAT instances very similar to classical random formulas using a low value of modularity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We show that this model works appropriately for different input values of number of variables n and clauses m. We also show that, if there exists a phase transition point SAT-UNSAT when the ratio clause/variable is increased, then it does not depend on the modularity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The proposed model is characterized by n variables, m clauses, c clusters and a parameter p. They generate c independent 3-SAT formulas, each one having {a mathematical formula}n/c variables and {a mathematical formula}(1 − p)m/c clauses, and then add pm link clauses using the entire set of variables, in the spirit of the techniques used traditionally to generate small-world graphs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The main difference is that the relation between the modularity of their generated instances and the parameter p is not so clear as in our model.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In particular, we force link clauses to connect variables of distinct communities, and we do not require communities to have the same number of internal clauses.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This way, we show the relation in our model between the modularity and the parameter p. This relation lets us to control the modularity of the generated instances, which has important effects on the performance of the solver (as shown in [36], [37]).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In order to analyze the community structure of the SAT instances obtained with our model, we have generated some sets of random formulas for different values of {a mathematical formula}Q ∈ {0.9,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.3} (hence {a mathematical formula}p=Q+1/c), and for different values of number of communities {a mathematical formula}c ∈ {10,20,40,80}.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Notice that the main goal of this experiment is to show that our model generates instances with modularity {a mathematical formula}Q ′ and number of communities {a mathematical formula}c ′ similar to the input parameters Q and c, for any number of variables n and clauses m. We use the algorithm described in [9] to compute an approximation of {a mathematical formula}Q ′ and {a mathematical formula}c ′ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In a second experiment, we generate families of instances with the same number of variables n and the same clause/variable ratios {a mathematical formula}m/n than in the previous experiment, and varying the number of communities c with a fixed modularity {a mathematical formula}Q=0.8.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Hereinafter we use in our experiments a fixed value of number of communities {a mathematical formula}c=40, assuming that this value is representative for real application problems, and therefore without altering general conclusions observed in the empirical results.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this section we check if this phenomenon also exists in the random SAT instances generated with our model, and if the new transition point, noted {a mathematical formula}r ′ , differs from the classical {a mathematical formula}r ′ ≠ r.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In Table 1 we report the phase transition point {a mathematical formula}r ′ we found for some families of formulas with {a mathematical formula}k=3, varying the modularity Q.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We observe that the phase transition point {a mathematical formula}r ′ decreases as the modularity Q increases.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In Table 2, we report the phase transition point {a mathematical formula}r ′ of some families of instances with {a mathematical formula}k=4.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Again, the phase transition point {a mathematical formula}r ′ of these families tends to decrease as the modularity Q increases.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">{a mathematical formula}|Pi ∩ S|=|S|/r, for {a mathematical formula}i=1, … ,r, and {a mathematical formula}|Pi ∩ S|=0, for {a mathematical formula}i=r+1, … ,c), then {a mathematical formula}locality(S,P)=1/r.</a>
