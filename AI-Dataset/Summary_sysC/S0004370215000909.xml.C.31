<a href="#1" id="1">Fitness variance in the local neighborhood: Once all trial solutions {a mathematical formula}X → j in the local neighborhood {a mathematical formula}Ni around {a mathematical formula}X → i have been identified, the fitness variance in {a mathematical formula}Ni is determined as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}nk,j symbolizes the sample size and {a mathematical formula}sk,j represents the spread of the samples of {a mathematical formula}fk(X → j) for {a mathematical formula}k=[1,N], which will be discussed very shortly.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">(b)</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Occurrence probability of the fitness samples: It is evident from the proposed nonuniform partitioning of the sample space that the fitness samples in the longer intervals are rare samples, probably owing to noise, and hence their contribution to the true fitness estimate of {a mathematical formula}X → i should not be regarded similarly to that of the fitness samples in the smaller interval.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We measure the contribution of the fitness samples of the interval j to the fitness estimate of the trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → i by a probability measure {a mathematical formula}pj:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}nk,ij represents the number of samples of {a mathematical formula}fk(X → i) in the jth interval for {a mathematical formula}j=[1,L].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This conventional process for ranking solutions in the same front using the crowding distance metric does not take into account the uncertainty in the measurement of the noisy fitness samples.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The possible promotion of a trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → i to the next generation (from the same-rank candidate pool) in the presence of noise depends on two important issues.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First, the greater the crowding distance measure CD({a mathematical formula}X → i), the higher is the chance of selecting {a mathematical formula}X → i from its competitors residing in the same front.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The uncertainty involved in the fitness measurement is taken care of by the second criterion — the probability of the nonoccurrence of the rare samples of {a mathematical formula}fk(X → i).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A higher value of this probability ensures proximity of the measured fitness samples to {a mathematical formula}f¯k(X → i) in the sample space.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The intermittent samples, far away from {a mathematical formula}f¯k(X → i), are supposed to result from the contamination effect of noise, and evidently their occurrence produces a longer tail in the sample distribution.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The noisy version of the kth objective {a mathematical formula}fk(X → ), of any trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → , is given by{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Η k represents the injected stochastic noise amplitude that follows a certain probability distribution function (PDF).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The following five variants of {a mathematical formula} Η k are considered here:</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">However, under the circumstances of noisy fitness landscapes, there is a need to address the uncertainty related to the fitness measurements while determining the hypervolume of the approximate Pareto front A.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The uncertainty problem is resolved here by weighting the size of the objective space covered by a nondominated solution {a mathematical formula}X → with the probability that {a mathematical formula}X → dominates at least one population member.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The higher the probability, the more reliable the measure of the objective space covered by {a mathematical formula}X → .</a>
