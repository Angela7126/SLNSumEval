<a href="#0" id="0">It has been shown that matrix-factorization-based CF methods usually fail to make confident predictions on the items (or users) for a specific user (or item), whose historical ratings are rare.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, the items (or users) of the most uncertain predictions in the target recommender system tend to be in the tail with high probabilities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, since we assume the source and the target recommender systems be similar, if the items (or users) are in the tail in the target system, then their correspondences tend to be in the tail in the source system as well.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This implies that the predictions on the corresponding entities in the source system may not be precise either, resulting in limited knowledge transferred through the extended matrix factorization method.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, besides focusing on prediction uncertainty, we need to take the long tail issue into consideration when designing an active entity selection strategy for building cross-system correspondences.</a>
