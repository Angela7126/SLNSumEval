<a href="#0" id="0">This represents a very important advantage of our system, as with the knowledge base means that we do not need to recompute the semantic rules every time we meet a new situation, i.e., the generated rules will even be preserved in different scenarios (see Section 4).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, the approach employed depends on the complexity of the activity and several challenges must be addressed, including automatically segmenting the observed human motions, identifying the important features of motions, determining the importance of the object(s) for the task, and defining different levels of abstraction.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, relevant parameters are identified to reproduce motions similar to those made by the demonstrator, while similar motions can be adjusted based on the parameterization of the given goal, where the goals are generally provided manually in this case, i.e., the system (robot) will not be able to extract the meaning of the action because they do not possess reasoning capabilities.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">[40] introduced a system that can understand actions based on their consequences, e.g., split or merge, but the core of this technique relies on a robust active tracking and segmentation method, which can detect changes in the manipulated object, its appearance, and its topological structure, i.e., the consequences of the action.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is a very complex problem since these techniques need to segment the continuous stream of human behavior and object information into meaningful classifications, preferably online.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, we propose a method that automatically identifies the semantics of human behaviors, which involves finding meaningful relationships between human motions and object properties in order to understand the activity performed by humans, i.e., the semantic representations are used to interpret a visual input to understand human activities.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If the system successfully infers the human activity, then this value will define the inferred goal g. In the case of failure, the system will execute the Knowledge Base sub-module and this will generate an equivalent state of the system to infer the correct concept value, where in this case, we refer to this value as the enhanced concept value {a mathematical formula}c(senhanced), which is later used to infer the goal g.</a>
