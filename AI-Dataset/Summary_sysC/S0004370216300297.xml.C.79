<a href="#0" id="0">We establish these results by means of program transposition — a novel polynomial transformation in which the rules of a given Disjunctive Datalog program {a mathematical formula}P are inverted by moving all IDB atoms between head and body while at the same time replacing their corresponding predicates with relevant auxiliary predicates of higher arity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our results stem from the correctness of program transposition: a novel polynomial transformation Ξ applicable to an arbitrary Disjunctive Datalog program {a mathematical formula}P in which the rules of {a mathematical formula}P are inverted by moving all IDB atoms from head to body and vice versa while at the same time replacing their corresponding predicates by auxiliary predicates of higher arity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The M-transposition of {a mathematical formula}P is the smallest program {a mathematical formula} Ξ M(P) containing each rule in {a mathematical formula}P with no disjunctive predicates and all Rules 1 – 5 given next, where {a mathematical formula} Ξ ⊤ is the least conjunction of ⊤ -atoms needed to make a rule safe, Φ is the conjunction of all Horn atoms in a rule, predicates {a mathematical formula}Pi, {a mathematical formula}Qj are disjunctive, and {a mathematical formula}y → ,z → are vectors of distinct fresh variables:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, rules of type 5 ensure that unmarked predicates R are instantiated with constants {a mathematical formula}a → whenever rules of type 4 yield facts {a mathematical formula}RR(a → ,a → ); thus, these rules encode a tautology under the intended meaning of the auxiliary predicates {a mathematical formula}RR.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The rest of this section is devoted to showing that {a mathematical formula} Ξ M(P) is indeed a Datalog rewriting of a Disjunctive Datalog program {a mathematical formula}P whenever M is a marking of {a mathematical formula}P. The correctness argument is similar in structure to the proof of Theorem 3 but it is more involved, as it requires a separate treatment for the auxiliary predicates depending on whether or not the relevant base predicate is marked.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The claim is shown analogously to Theorem 9 with the additional observation that Step 1 of the proof only needs rules involving auxiliary predicates of the form {a mathematical formula}Q ‾ P and {a mathematical formula}QP to show facts about a predicate P. □</a>
