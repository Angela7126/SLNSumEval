<a href="#3" id="3">The Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measureGiven a network {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E), the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality of node {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V(G) is defined as the function {a mathematical formula}cSh:V → R such that:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Ν :2V(G) → R is defined for every subset of nodes, {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ V(G), as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this subsection we will construct an efficient algorithm for computing the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure for unweighted graphs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Specifically, in such graphs, the number of nodes on the shortest path between s and t is equal to the distance between s and t, denoted by {a mathematical formula}d(s,t).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{sup:12} In other words, we have: {a mathematical formula}| Ψ (p)|=d(s,t).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Based on this, it is possible to simplify (12) as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Using the above equation, we are able to compute a parameterized betweenness centrality for weighted graphs {a mathematical formula}cfg ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Specifically, for a node v, we compute {a mathematical formula}cfg ⁎ (v) by iterating over all other nodes and summing their contributions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">More formally:{a mathematical formula} where the value of the function {a mathematical formula}g Δ ⁎ depends solely on the number of nodes lying on the shortest paths between s and v.</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">For every node {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V, compute its normalized centrality, denoted {a mathematical formula}c(v).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{sup:13} Depending on the experiment, this normalized centrality is computed either using the standard betweenness centrality measure, or using our Semivalue-based betweenness centrality measure with the following probability distribution:{a mathematical formula} The normalized centralities of all nodes can be interpreted as a ranking of nodes, where the greater the normalized centrality of a node, the greater its ranking.</a>
