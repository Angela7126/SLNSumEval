<a href="#0" id="0">Thus, a stronger specification of the fractal encoding T may be thought of as a function of three variables, the source image A, the target image B, and the partitioning scheme P:{a mathematical formula} where the cardinality of the resulting set is determined solely by the partitioning P. That is, each subimage {a mathematical formula}bi that P extracts from B will be represented by exactly one element of the set T.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The partitioning scheme P extracts a set of images {a mathematical formula}bi from the target image B.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The next step of the algorithm is to perform a systematic examination of the source image A for fragments of A that can be said to best match a particular image {a mathematical formula}bi.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The method by which the search is conducted may be varied, as can the meaning of what is said to be a “ best match. ”</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One method for solving this puzzle is this: from this set of candidates, we may form the fractal representations from the fractal encoding of the transformation of each candidate image X in terms of image C.{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} This provides a set of possible transformations, which we shall label Ω , from which to seek the most analogous transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ and thereby find which candidate image was responsible for it.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this example, the problem is to determine for which of the candidate images the transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ is made most analogous to transformation T. We first will represent T as a fractal representation, and then generate a set of candidate transformations Ω as shown in Fig.</a>
