<a href="#1" id="1">Given a CSP {a mathematical formula}P= 〈 V,D,C 〉 , a search state S for P where each variable {a mathematical formula}x ∈ V has a non-empty domain: {a mathematical formula}|S(x)|>0, and a constraint {a mathematical formula}c ∈ C, the GAC propagator for c returns a new search state {a mathematical formula}S ′ which:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The propagator trees created by the algorithm GenTree (Algorithm 3) can be executed in {a mathematical formula}O(nd) time, where n is the arity of the constraint, and d is the domain size.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However they have the disadvantage that they can have {a mathematical formula}O(2nd) nodes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section we show how to generate symmetry-reduced trees, and that they can be much more compact than standard propagator trees.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To apply a symmetry {a mathematical formula}g ∈ G to a propagator tree we define an image function in Definition 12.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Definition 12</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given a propagator tree T defined on constraint c and a literal permutation {a mathematical formula}g ∈ G, then {a mathematical formula}Tg is defined recursively as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}The group element g is applied pointwise to Prune and Test, and the image function is applied recursively to the Left and Right subtrees.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Proof</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Given a propagator tree T generated for a constraint c and node-state S, and given any variable-stable permutation g which is a symmetry of c,{a mathematical formula}Tgis a propagator tree for constraint c and node-state{a mathematical formula}Sg.Follows trivially from Theorem 2, and the fact that {a mathematical formula}cg=c as g is a symmetry of c. □</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">While we have shown that using symmetry-reduced trees can, in highly symmetric constraints, produce a polynomial bound in tree size, these polynomials can be extremely large.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, for a constraint with total variable symmetry and variables of domain size 3 the upper bound is {a mathematical formula}O(n23).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this section we will substantially tighten this bound.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Theorem 3</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Given a partially symmetric constraint c defined by parameters{a mathematical formula} 〈 n1,d1,n2,d2 〉 , the size of a symmetry-reduced tree for c that performs whole-variable branching is as follows, where{a mathematical formula}d=max(d1,d2).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Table 9, Table 10 also show that propagator trees compare well to the generic GAC propagators as the arity is increased.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">{a mathematical formula}STR2+ is the fastest of the generic GAC propagators and it is consistently slower than all propagator tree methods.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Of the three problems, only Life can be used to compare propagator trees with symmetry-reduced trees.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The Life constraint has {a mathematical formula}8!=40,320 symmetries, the standard propagator tree has 26,524 nodes and the symmetry-reduced tree has 410 nodes.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Table 11 shows that the symmetry-reduced tree is less efficient than the standard tree on this problem, taking up to 3 times longer to solve to optimality.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Code generation proved to be somewhat more efficient than the VM for the symmetry-reduced tree.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The Immigration constraint has {a mathematical formula}8!×2=80,640 symmetries.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">It is not possible to generate the standard propagator tree within 12 GB of memory.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The symmetry-reduced tree has 34,712 nodes.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">The Brian's Brain constraint has {a mathematical formula}8!=40,320 symmetries.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">It is not possible to generate the standard propagator tree for this constraint within 12 GiB of memory.</a>
