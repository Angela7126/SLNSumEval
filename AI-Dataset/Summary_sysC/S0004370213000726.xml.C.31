<a href="#0" id="0">A clause C is called 1-provable with respect to a CNF formula Φ , if {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ ¬C ⊢ 1 ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A clause C is thus 1-provable if it is an implicate of C and the fact that C is an implicate can be proved using unit propagation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The notion of 1-provability was introduced in [15].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A formula Φ is called unit refutation complete if every implicate C of Φ is 1-provable with respect to Φ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The notion of unit refutation completeness was introduced in [26] and later inspired the definition of propagation completeness in [9], which we give in the following subsection.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Definition 2.5</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(See Definition 4 in [12].)</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A CNF decomposition of a propagation algorithm (propagator) {a mathematical formula}fP is a formula in CNF {a mathematical formula} Φ P over variables {a mathematical formula}x ∪ y such that</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We have seen in Theorem 3.6 that it is hard to check whether a given clause C is an empowering implicate of a given formula Φ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The hard part of this test is to check whether C is in the set S of all implicates of Φ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The core of the proof of Theorem 3.6 shows that considering a smaller set {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊆ S of all empowering implicates of Φ does not make this test easier.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let C be an empowering implicate of a formula Φ which is not 1-provable.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This means that if we falsify all the literals in C and add them to Φ , thus producing {a mathematical formula} Ψ = Φ ∧ ¬C, then we get a contradiction which is not provable by unit resolution.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">By using the previous proposition we show that we may add the clause C to the obtained clause {a mathematical formula}C Ψ to obtain a clause which is both 1-provable and empowering.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Proof</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">From Theorem 4.2 it follows that there is an empowering 1-provable implicate {a mathematical formula}C Φ of Φ with an empowered literal ℓ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Let {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ denote the formula which originates from Φ after adding unit clauses formed by negated literals from {a mathematical formula}C Φ , i.e.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">{a mathematical formula} Φ ′ ≡ Φ ∧ ¬C Φ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Since {a mathematical formula}C Φ is 1-provable it follows that {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ ⊢ 1 ⊥ , i.e.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">we can derive contradiction from {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ by using only unit resolution.Due to the nature of unit resolutions, we can assume that the unit refutation proceeds in two phases.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Proof</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">This is actually a very simple corollary to Lemma 3.9.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">It is enough to construct a tied chain of length n. The following formula (for given n) contains such a chain:{a mathematical formula} Clearly both the number of variables and the number of clauses are linear in n. First, let us observe that {a mathematical formula}(A1 ∨ A2 ∨ ⋯ ∨ An ∨ z) is an empowering implicate with empowered literal z.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">This is because by falsifying all literals {a mathematical formula}A1, … ,An we get a quadratic formula which has z as a unit implicate, but unit resolution cannot derive this fact.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Since the only tied chain in {a mathematical formula} Φ n is composed by all the n clauses in {a mathematical formula} Φ n, by Lemma 3.9 we need all these clauses in order to derive an empowering implicate.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Proof</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The formula {a mathematical formula} Φ n in the previous theorem had at most one negative literal in each clause.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Therefore, switching all literals to their complement in {a mathematical formula} Φ n creates a Horn CNF formula with the desired property.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Lemma 5.1</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The problem of testing whether a given CNF formula Φ has an empowering implicate is in NP.</a>
