<a href="#0" id="0">Consequently, the last derivation step must be an application of (Cut), i.e., there must be a concept {a mathematical formula}E ≠ C such that {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊨ C ⊑ E and {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊨ E ⊑ B.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Now assume E does not contain B as a conjunct.We construct a specific interpretation {a mathematical formula}( Δ I, ⋅ I) as follows ( Ε denotes the empty word):</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The latter is however not the case as this would imply by Lemma 1 that there is a homomorphism from {a mathematical formula}(IC,xC) to {a mathematical formula}(IE,xE) and consequently, via Lemma 2{a mathematical formula} ∅ ⊨ E ⊑ C, contradicting our finding above.Yet, the root individual {a mathematical formula}xE ˜ cannot satisfy any other concept {a mathematical formula}C ″ from {a mathematical formula}C2n − 1 ∖ {C} either, since this, via {a mathematical formula} ∅ ⊨ E ⊑ C ″ , would imply {a mathematical formula} ∅ ⊨ C ⊑ C ″ which is not the case (by induction on k one can show that there cannot be a homomorphism between the characteristic pointed interpretations of any two distinct concepts from any {a mathematical formula}Ck).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In essence, the lemma below implies that, in case of flattened terminologies explicitly containing all elements of Pre, we can derive all subsumees of a concept by (1) applying the rule {a mathematical formula}(Ex) to construct existential restrictions from two concepts in a subsumption relation and/or (2) replacing concepts occurring within subsumees by their subsumees.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given a regular tree grammar {a mathematical formula}G=(S,N,F,R), the derivation relation {a mathematical formula} → G associated to G is a relation on terms from {a mathematical formula}T(F ∪ N) such that {a mathematical formula}s → Gt if and only if there is a rule {a mathematical formula}N → Α ∈ R and there is a context C such that {a mathematical formula}s=C[N/X] and {a mathematical formula}t=C[ Α /X], where X is a variable from {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By definition of the derivation relation, it does not necessarily hold that {a mathematical formula}f2(B,A) ∈ L(G) ⇒ f2(A,B) ∈ L(G) or {a mathematical formula}f2(A,f2(B,C)) ∈ L(G) ⇒ f2(f2(A,B),C) ∈ L(G).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Assume that {a mathematical formula}n=1, i.e., {a mathematical formula}C=A1, and assume that {a mathematical formula}A1 is the only concept symbol such that {a mathematical formula}T ⊨ A ⊑ A1.</a>
