<a href="#0" id="0">To demonstrate the capacity of our system for finding the relevant descriptors in much larger state spaces, we present two example of the POs generated during learning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The first is presented in (26) and it corresponds to the {a mathematical formula}6×6 grid case, where the target counter was required to move from the upper right corner to the goal cell at the upper left corner.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A comparison of this PO with the initial version generated after action instruction (25) shows that the system could find the four unchanging causative relevant descriptors that produced the changes coded in the PO, i.e., the descriptors indicating that all the cells in the trajectory to the goal should be empty.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The second example shows a PO generated for a {a mathematical formula}7×7 grid (see (28)) for moving the target counter from the lower left corner of the grid to the goal position.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this case, the number of unchangeable relevant descriptors was five, as shown by comparing this PO with its initial version (27) generated after action instruction.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this experiment, many POs were generated during the learning process involving one-cell actions due to the movement restrictions when all the cells were occupied except one.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Although these POs were simpler than those with multi-cell actions (e.g., (24)), some of them still required refinements due to unexpected effects (Section 4.2.2).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This was the case for those POs that pushed two counters at the same time, such as the first PO executed in the sequence shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">14,{a mathematical formula} Note that the precondition of PO (30) contains the descriptor {a mathematical formula}o(0, − 1), which did not change with the action but it was relevant for obtaining the coded effect.</a>
