<a href="#0" id="0">Hence, the kinematic model of this robot is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} The solution set of this model, the circle of center {a mathematical formula}(a,b) and radius l, is depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, the connected components {a mathematical formula}A1,A2,A3,A4 of the computed boxes shown in the right hand side graphic of Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The projection {a mathematical formula} Σ x (resp.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} Σ q) of the solution set Σ is called the robot reachable workspace (resp.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As illustrated by this diagram, {a mathematical formula} Σ ⁎ is generally made of several connected components.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The proposed method for the generalized aspect computation relies on solving the following NCSP whose solutions are the nonsingular configurations of the robot:{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula} Σ ([x],[q]) be the solution set of this NCSP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, for a given box {a mathematical formula}([x],[q]) ∈ S, the solution set restricted to this box{a mathematical formula} is proved to be connected and singularity free, and is thus a subset of one generalized aspect.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Hence the final output of the process will be several sets of boxes {a mathematical formula}Sk, each of them being certified to enclose one connected set of nonsingular configurations (CSNC).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">angles) are considered to be the command {a mathematical formula}(q1,q2) ∈ [2,6]×[4,9] (resp.</a>

<a href="#10" id="10">Pose {a mathematical formula}P1 induces no link collision and thus remains within the collision-free CSNC.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Blue boxes represent joint limit boundaries where the limited joint angle becomes {a mathematical formula} Π /2 or {a mathematical formula} − Π /2.</a>
