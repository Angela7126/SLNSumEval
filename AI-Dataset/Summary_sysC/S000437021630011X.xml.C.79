<a href="#0" id="0">On the other hand, termination of a program is proved by showing that the new natural number constants introduced by the loops and used in the smallest macro expressions are well-defined, which in logic means that the resulting theory {a mathematical formula} Π PX → is consistent, thus there is a model where the new constants are mapped to natural numbers.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To compute {a mathematical formula} Π OuterX → , we compute first {a mathematical formula} Π InnerX → , which is equivalent to the set of following sentences:{a mathematical formula} Solving the recurrences, we have{a mathematical formula} We can now eliminate terms like {a mathematical formula}A(n) and {a mathematical formula}B(n), expand the smallest macro expression, and obtain {a mathematical formula} Π InnerX → as the set of following sentences:{a mathematical formula} Thus the set of sentences for the body of the loop Outer is equivalent to the set of the following sentences:{a mathematical formula} Thus {a mathematical formula} Π OuterX → ∪ {Q=0,R=X} is equivalent to{a mathematical formula} Now get rid of {a mathematical formula}X(n) and {a mathematical formula}Y(n) as they do not change: {a mathematical formula}X(n)=X and {a mathematical formula}Y(n)=Y, get rid of A and B as they are irrelevant now, and expand the smallest macro expression, we obtain {a mathematical formula} Π PX → as the set of following sentences:{a mathematical formula} From these axioms, we can show the partial correctness of Cohen's algorithm by proving the following two properties, under the precondition that {a mathematical formula}X ≥ 0 and {a mathematical formula}Y ≥ 1:{a mathematical formula} For the first property, {a mathematical formula}R ′ <Y trivially follows from the condition of the Outer loop.</a>
