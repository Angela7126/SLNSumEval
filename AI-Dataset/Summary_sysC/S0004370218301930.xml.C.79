<a href="#0" id="0">In other words, the player's utility grows with the number of players in her neighborhood that take the action, up to a limit of {a mathematical formula}K. Consequently, the tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 G,K,C1, … ,Cn 〉 defines a “ best-shot ” public goods game where G is an underlying interactions network, {a mathematical formula}K is the maximal number of public goods that can affect i's utility and {a mathematical formula}C1, … ,Cn are the costs for each player for taking the action.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consider a global function of the form{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Φ i(v) denotes the share of player i in the global potential function in outcome v. An intuitive and simple version of {a mathematical formula} Φ i(v) was proposed for the simplified version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game in a former paper [8]:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider the inequality of Proposition 1{a mathematical formula} Combining this inequality with the fact that players in local maxima of the potential function (i.e., PNEs) are in state {a mathematical formula}Tl<K, one can conclude that each player in state {a mathematical formula}Tl contributes more to the potential than a player in state {a mathematical formula}Fl (i.e., {a mathematical formula}b − l ⋅ Δ >a).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One can easily observe that the inequation {a mathematical formula}b − l ⋅ Δ ≤ b holds since {a mathematical formula}l ≥ 0 and {a mathematical formula} Δ >0; such an observation, together with the fact that {a mathematical formula}a<b (Proposition 1), leads to:{a mathematical formula} Namely, the upper bound on a share of a single player in the global potential function is b.The lower bound of the player's share {a mathematical formula}min ⁡ (a,b − l ⋅ Δ ) in the global potential function can be evaluated by the help of the following inequation:{a mathematical formula}Given the previous observations, one can evaluate the upper bound of the global potential function by the following equation:{a mathematical formula} whereas the lower bound can be evaluated as follows:{a mathematical formula} Consequently, the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the global potential function is:{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In case {a mathematical formula}K ≥ 2, Proposition 1 restricts the value of Δ to be in the range {a mathematical formula}b − a2 ⋅ K< Δ <b − a2 ⋅ (K − 1).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let us fix the value of Δ to be {a mathematical formula}(b − a) ⋅ 2 ⋅ K − 14 ⋅ (K − 1) ⋅ K, which is the center of the restricted range.Consider the case that the player's state, before changing her strategy, is {a mathematical formula}Fl<K.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In such a case, the change in the global potential, is {a mathematical formula}b − a − 2 ⋅ l ⋅ Δ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since the upper bound of l is {a mathematical formula}K − 1 and Δ is positive, the following inequality holds:{a mathematical formula}A change to the global potential of {a mathematical formula}a − b+2 ⋅ l ⋅ Δ will occur if the player's state before the strategy update is {a mathematical formula}Tl ≥ K.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Such a change results in the following inequality:{a mathematical formula}Consequently, the minimal improvement to the global potential, as a result of a better-response step, is {a mathematical formula}b − a2 ⋅ K when {a mathematical formula}K ≥ 2.In case {a mathematical formula}K=1 the only possible value of l is zero when the player's state is {a mathematical formula}Fl<K, which makes Equation (14) trivial.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If the player's state before the strategy update is {a mathematical formula}Tl ≥ K, the value {a mathematical formula} Δ =b − a can be used to obtain the lower bound of {a mathematical formula}b − a2 ⋅ K.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For the simple version of the PGG where {a mathematical formula}K=1, it is shown next that the players' ability to propose payoff transfers enables the extended version of better-response dynamics to converge to a stable state of greater (or equal) efficiency than that of the initial, not necessarily stable, outcome.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Similarly to the previous case, if {a mathematical formula}statei(v)=Fl<K, player i's utility will be also decreased by 1, which results in i's willingness to propose a payoff of at most 1 to player j in order to convince player j to stay with its choice T. When {a mathematical formula}statei(v)=FK, j's change of strategy from T to F will decrease i's payoff to {a mathematical formula}K − 1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For every initial outcome{a mathematical formula}v ∈ V, the social welfare of{a mathematical formula}v ⁎ , which is the end result of runningAlgorithm 1on v, is greater than or equal to the social welfare of v.In order to prove that the social welfare of {a mathematical formula}v ⁎ is not lower than that of v one can show that each change of strategy, resulting from the execution of function {a mathematical formula}onStrategySelect(), has two possible consequences.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The sum of non-zero messages (from players 1 and 4) can be larger than {a mathematical formula}C (e.g., rationally preferable by 1 and 4), which will prevent player 3 from changing her strategy.Player 4 does not change its strategy since {a mathematical formula}state4(v)=F2 and the net loss of player 4 at this stage is {a mathematical formula} Τ 4(v) ≤ C.</a>
