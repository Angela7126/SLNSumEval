<a href="#4" id="4">After the user's preferences selection, in a common first step, Aetheris and {a mathematical formula}CP+Sky automatically identify a smaller set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ which allows for the computation of a concise representation on the patterns thanks to the use of converters (cf.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}CP+Sky builds dynamically a more concise set by pruning unpromising patterns (the set of representative patterns of {a mathematical formula}CP+Sky is included in the set of representative patterns of Aetheris) (cf.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">3 (top) depicts the benefit of skylineability in the general case where it becomes possible to focus only on a subset of patterns and measures (i.e.</a>
