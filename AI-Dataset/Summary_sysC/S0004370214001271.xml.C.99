<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}M ⁎ will be shown to be equivalent to alternating between running {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ on a search graph, and expanding the search graph based on collisions found by {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a result, demonstrating that the construction of the search graph takes finite time and that the search graph will eventually contain the optimal path, if extant, is sufficient to prove that {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ is complete and optimal.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If an optimal path exists,{a mathematical formula}M ⁎ will find the optimal path in finite time if one of two cases always hold</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The search graph{a mathematical formula}Gschcontains an optimal path,{a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (vs,vf).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The search graph{a mathematical formula}Gschcontains a path{a mathematical formula} Π (vs,vc)such that{a mathematical formula}g( Π (vs,vc))+h(vc) ≤ g( Π ⁎ (vs,vf)), and{a mathematical formula} ∃ vb ∈ Π (vs,vc)such that{a mathematical formula} Ψ (vc) ⊈ Cb.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Case 2 implies the existence of a path which has not been explored by {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ that leads to a robot – robot collision at {a mathematical formula}vc, and which costs no more than {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (vs,vf).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If the path had been explored, {a mathematical formula}vb and {a mathematical formula}vc would have been added to the open list and thus to the explored graph {a mathematical formula}Gexp.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this case, {a mathematical formula}Cb would include all robots involved in the collision at {a mathematical formula}vc, i.e.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">the robots in {a mathematical formula} Ψ (vc).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If case 1 holds, running {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ on {a mathematical formula}Gsch will find {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (vs,vf) in finite time, unless there exists a cheaper path {a mathematical formula} Π cheaper(vs,vf) ⊆ Gsch, which we now show would satisfy the conditions for case 2 to hold.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Recall that {a mathematical formula}rM ⁎ uses {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ as the underlying planning algorithm, so that {a mathematical formula}rM ⁎ typically expands more vertices than {a mathematical formula}ODrM ⁎ or {a mathematical formula}EPErM ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Thus, we expected {a mathematical formula}ODrM ⁎ to solve more instances within the given time limit.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}ODrM ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}EPErM ⁎ solved twice as many problems involving 25 robots as basic {a mathematical formula}rM ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The near identical performance of {a mathematical formula}ODrM ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}EPErM ⁎ can be accounted for by the similarity in performance of OD and {a mathematical formula}EPEA ⁎ .</a>
