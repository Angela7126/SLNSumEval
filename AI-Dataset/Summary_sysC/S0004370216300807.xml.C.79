<a href="#0" id="0">We want to point out that although we consider cartographic principles for geographic maps, our research goal has the following peculiarities: (i) maps have to be suitable for usage not only by humans but also by machines; (ii) traditional cartography builds upon the notion of Euclidean space, while in our context, the space being mapped, that is the Web, is purely relational; (iii) traditional cartography uses the notion of scale to abstract information on a map; the scale gives all points equal importance.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By making a parallel with geography, Γ represents the “ region ” or “ territory ” being abstracted (see also Definition 2.1) via the map and nodes in {a mathematical formula}VM represent “ points ” that are relevant for the map; these are the distinctive traits used as the basis for the identity of the region (see Definition 2.2).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The k-map of Γ is the good map generated by the set of distinguished nodes {a mathematical formula}{v ∈ V Γ :f(v) ≥ k}, where {a mathematical formula}f:V Γ → R is a selective function measuring a specific property of the nodes in Γ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A graph region Γ captures the specification given via a navigational expression e starting from a single node of the graph where {a mathematical formula} Γ .E Γ and {a mathematical formula} Γ .V Γ are edges and nodes navigated during the evaluation of e. The need to start from a node (or a set of nodes) is motivated by the fact that our framework is meant to be used on the Web, and thus, it is infeasible to start the evaluation of a navigational expression from all nodes of the Web graph (assuming one can enumerate all of them).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that the space required to evaluate an {a mathematical formula}L expression and build the (k-)map of the corresponding region is proportional to the time, since only relevant nodes are visited.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our approach differs from these in an important respect: they focus on identifying a partial slice of data of a particular interest but do not attempt to map, in the sense to represent “ all ” data in a suitable mathematical form.</a>
