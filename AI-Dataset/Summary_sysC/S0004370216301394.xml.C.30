<a href="#0" id="0">We adopt a Bayesian active regression approach on the log likelihood using the samples it has already computed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We refer to this approach as Bayesian Active Posterior Estimation (BAPE).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, given any estimate {a mathematical formula}P ˆ An(Xobs, Θ ) of the log joint probability constructed using a set {a mathematical formula}An of n parameter-likelihood pairs, the estimate of the posterior distribution is{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Bayesian active posterior estimation: We now describe the procedure to determine the point at which we should query the likelihood.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assume we are considering the point {a mathematical formula} Θ + for the next evaluation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our GP over the log joint probability gives us uncertainty for {a mathematical formula}log ⁡ P( Θ +,Xobs) – depicted by {a mathematical formula}pB,pR,pG in blue, green and red respectively.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For {a mathematical formula}pB, we add {a mathematical formula}( Θ +,pB) as a hallucinated point to the {a mathematical formula}t − 1 points we already have and obtain an estimate of the posterior {a mathematical formula}P ˆ At − 1 ∪ ( Θ +,pB).</a>
