<a href="#0" id="0">I-TMP [14] should also be mentioned here, although it strictly speaking does not involve a task planning algorithm but is given a task graph which represents a set of potential plans.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For instance, can-move-pick must be guaranteed to either produce a {a mathematical formula} Τ (1) where the object in question has been picked by the robot, or else return “ false. ” Geometrical effects are not in general added to the symbolic state component, although for domain-debugging purposes, there is an option to do that for specific predicates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It then attempts to find a feasible sequence of geometric actions and states by changing the geometric choices of the selected actions (call to {a mathematical formula}searchGeomSeq( … ) at line 7).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We first retrieve the already moved objects {a mathematical formula}Ocoll that collided the largest number of times with a robot's hand or grasped object when trying to find a geometric instance of a:{a mathematical formula} where nbColl is the function that returns the number of collisions that were detected between the robot's hand and object o, and collisions that were detected between the object grasped by the robot and object o, and {a mathematical formula}Omoved is the set of objects that have been moved by hybrid actions of P. The statistics used for evaluating nbColl are gathered during the generation of target poses (which precedes motion planning) when the preconditions of {a mathematical formula}ai are evaluated.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A naive implementation of Algorithm 4 leads the search to try every geometric instance (binding) of a selected action (function {a mathematical formula}sampleGeomPreconds( … )) exhaustively, and only after repeated failed attempts, focus on another selected action.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, when backtracking occurs for kinematic reasons, the choice of geometric instances can be reduced by using our knowledge of the kinematic model of the robot, together with constraints automatically generated from the symbolic action sequence.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For instance, if a task consists in putting a glass in a sink with a top grasp, there is enough information in the symbolic plan to generate the kinematic constraints automatically, because the position and dimensions of the sink are known, as well as which manipulator and which type of grasp are used.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">When a symbolic backtrack occurs, the constraints associated with the action are removed from the network, and the set of intervals {a mathematical formula}D is restored.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">During geometric backtracking, a similar procedure is applied, i.e., the set of intervals is restored, but the difference is that no constraints are removed from the constraint network because the symbolic action sequence has not been changed.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">20 where the geometric constraints are not propagated, there is no clear winner among the selection functions, since most feasible problem instances are challenging owing to complex robot's kinematics and geometric issues, such as collisions with cups.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the present section, we evaluate the effect of propagating geometric constraints on the global search process, i.e., combining the symbolic search space and the geometric search space.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However, the sampling resolution associated with the shipping area is 84 ({a mathematical formula}7×3 positions and 4 orientations), which implies that, for every problem instance, the final geometric state that results from applying a solution plan from the initial state must contain both pallets side by side in the shipping area, oriented so that their bar codes face the upper side of the map.</a>
