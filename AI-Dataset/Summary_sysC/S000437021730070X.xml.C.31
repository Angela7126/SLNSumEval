<a href="#1" id="1">Translational stable modelLet Π be a program and {a mathematical formula}A a {a mathematical formula} Τ ( Π )-structure.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We say that {a mathematical formula}A is a stable model (an answer set) of Π if {a mathematical formula}A is a model of {a mathematical formula}SM( Π ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We refer this definition to the translational definition.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For convenience, we use {a mathematical formula}AS( Π ) to denote the collection of all stable models of Π .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Two programs are said to be equivalent if they have the same set of stable models.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Definition 7</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Progressional stable modelLet Π be a normal program and {a mathematical formula}M a structure of {a mathematical formula} Τ ( Π ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}M is called a progressional stable model of Π iff {a mathematical formula}M ∞ ( Π )=M.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Proof</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In order to prove this theorem, we introduce an alternative equivalent definition, and show that it is equivalent to both the progressional definition and the translational definition described above.Let Π be a program and {a mathematical formula}M a structure of {a mathematical formula} Τ ( Π ).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We say that {a mathematical formula}M is a justified stable model of Π iff</a>

<a href="#13" id="13">First-order definabilityLet Π be a program and Φ a first-order sentence of the signature {a mathematical formula} Τ ( Π ).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let {a mathematical formula}C be a class of first-order structures.</a>
