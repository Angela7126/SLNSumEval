<a href="#0" id="0">Said more intuitively, once the nodes in the most influential set S follow the behavior {a mathematical formula}xS prescribed to them by a desired stable outcome x achieving the goal of interest, they become collectively “ so influential ” that their behavior “ forces ” every other individual to a unique choice of behavior!</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, {a mathematical formula}xi ∈ { − 1,1} denotes the behavior of individual i, where {a mathematical formula}xi=1 indicates that i “ adopts ” a particular behavior and {a mathematical formula}xi= − 1 indicates i “ does not adopt ” the behavior.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We denote by {a mathematical formula}fi:{ − 1,1}n − 1 → R the function that quantifies the influence of other individuals on i.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We denote the set of all PSNE of the game {a mathematical formula}G by{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula} Therefore, we can construct an LIG that has exactly the same set of PSNE as the polymatrix game, in the following way.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We denote any node i's action by {a mathematical formula}xi ∈ { − 1,1}, its threshold by {a mathematical formula}bi, and the influence of any node i on another node j by {a mathematical formula}wij.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Furthermore, denote the set of parents of a node i by {a mathematical formula}Pa(i).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consider any {a mathematical formula}{0,1}-action LIG instance I, where w and b denote the influence factors and the thresholds, respectively (see Definition 3.7).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We show that x is a PSNE of I if and only if {a mathematical formula}x ′ is a PSNE of J, where {a mathematical formula}xi ′ =2xi − 1 for any i.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Note that at any PSNE of J, {a mathematical formula}v0 must play 1.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We claim that there exists a different PSNE where every extra player plays 1 if and only if I has a solution.Suppose that there exists a solution {a mathematical formula}SI to I.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}E0 is the only PSNE in J with the k extra players playing 1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We rather select a node i that will most likely show that the current partial joint action cannot lead to a PSNE and explore the two actions of i, {a mathematical formula}xi ∈ { − 1,1} in a suitable order.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Note that a “ no ” answer to this requires a proof that one of the players j, {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ j ≤ i+1, can never play {a mathematical formula}xj according to the partial joint action {a mathematical formula}x1:(i+1).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">By construction, a set of players S play the same joint-action {a mathematical formula}aS ∈ { − 1,1}|S| in two distinct PSNE x and y of the LIG if and only if both of the corresponding hyperedges {a mathematical formula}ex and {a mathematical formula}ey (resp.)</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Note however that this adaptation is exclusive to a very specific instance of our general problem formulation: identifying “ most influential nodes ” with respect to the goal being maximizing the number of +1's in the PSNE (see Definition 3.6 in Section 3.2 for a definition and discussion of our problem formulation and the role that the “ objective function ” {a mathematical formula}g(.)</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In words, {a mathematical formula}C is the stable cloture set, consisting of stable outcomes that can prevent a filibuster (i.e., every PSNE in {a mathematical formula}C contains at least 60 “ yes ” votes and thus, can induce a cloture).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Now, we would like to select a minimal set of senators such that {a mathematical formula}C contains the set {a mathematical formula}PS(V) of the PSNE-extensions of these senators' voting “ yes ” (i.e., their voting “ yes ” can only lead to a stable cloture scenario, thereby preventing a filibuster).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The problem formulation above guarantees a nonempty solution T if there exists some PSNE in {a mathematical formula}C that is not “ dominated ” by any PSNE in {a mathematical formula}S ∖ C.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We only concentrate on finding a set of initial adopters that can drive the forward recursion process to some stable cloture scenario (i.e., a PSNE in {a mathematical formula}C).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">It seems to us that such characterizations would be key in any study of the potential submodularity properties of that “ influence spread function ” {a mathematical formula}fg,h,G as we have just defined.</a>
