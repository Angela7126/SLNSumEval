<a href="#0" id="0">Several books and survey papers review the state of the art for a few focused deliberation functions, e.g., planning [91], monitoring [169], goal reasoning [213], recognition of actions and plans [129], architectures [127], or human – aware navigation [130].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The integration of planning and acting functions is a critical issues in the design of a deliberation system.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Planning requires descriptive models giving the requirements and possible effects of actions (know-what).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is important to keep in mind that planning and acting may work in distinct state spaces and action spaces.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One may characterize ideas and approaches for specifying deliberation models for planning and acting into the following categories:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Multiple model approaches use distinct models: an abstract descriptive model for planning and one or several operational models for acting to refine each plan step into skills.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These approaches may use either (i) a uniform knowledge representation for specifying planning and acting problems at different levels of granularity, e.g., formal action languages, or (ii) heterogeneous knowledge representations at various levels, e.g., precondition – effect operators for planning, procedures or rules for acting.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Planning is a core deliberation function for an autonomous robot.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is illustrated in the integration of motion planning to task planning, e.g., [33], [4], in probabilistic planning techniques, and in reinforcement learning (Section 7.2).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We will focus instead on problems and approaches for the integration of planning in a robot deliberation system.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Motion planning and task planning are different problems that use distinct representations and search techniques.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let us briefly present the state of the art in motion and manipulation planning and review a few approaches (listed in Table 5) integrating it with task planning.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The system alternates between symbolic planning phases and the real execution of geometric actions in the environment.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">However, temporal planners that rely on timelines, i.e., partially specified evolution of state variables over time, are more flexible in the integration of planning and acting and, in most cases, more expressive, e.g., allowing the reference to instants beyond starting and ending time of actions.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Although MDPs are often used in robotics at the sensory-motor level, in particular within reinforcement learning approaches (Section 7.2), SSP techniques are not as widely disseminated at the deliberative planning and acting level.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Allow the planner to query databases for facts it needs specifically to address a given planning problem, or to query knowledge bases for additional models of its environment that are relevant to the task at hand.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Task planning is also needed for deliberation.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">As we will see next, they offer some advantages in the integration of planning and acting and in plan repair.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Open domain planning also has a large potential and should be more widely deployed in robotics deliberation systems.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">However, most approaches address the distinct requirements of planning and acting with decomposition scheme (Fig.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">3) where planning reasons with abstract descriptive models of actions while acting uses operational models to refine actions into procedures, called skills, that are further refined into commands.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Acting knowledge has also to be checked for consistency with respect to planning models.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">As seen in Section 3.2 temporal planning often produces partially instantiated plans with a least commitment approach allowing acting to adapt to the contingencies of the execution context.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Another important point is that all CSP approaches rely on common models to produce plans, skills and commands (often the separation between planning and acting is not sharp).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Probabilistic approaches are also appealing for the interleaving of planning and acting.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Adequate integration between planning and acting is critical.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Early systems assumed that planning primitives were directly executable, reducing the acting function to reacting without much refinement deliberation.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Monitoring requires a close link to and an extension of planning and acting domain knowledge in order to express conditions to be monitored while carrying out a plan.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The state of the art illustrates a few systems implementing monitoring functions where the knowledge representation link is addressed at the most abstract planning level.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The design of appropriate knowledge representations for planning and acting should integrate as early as possible the requirements of monitoring.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">We already discussed task planning with sensing and information gathering actions (Section 3.4).</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Planning and other deliberation functions reason about objects in the environment through symbolic attributes and relations linking these symbols.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">This system is naturally queried by planning, acting and monitoring functions to acquire information about the current contextual state of the world.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Semantic maps endow a robot with deduction abilities about its environment that complement and enhance its perceiving function as well as its planning and acting functions.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">We discussed a few approaches for acquiring semantic maps and integrating the learned knowledge into planning and acting models.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">The simpler and more efficient state space task planning approaches are very relevant in many applications; it is unclear whether they can replace temporal planning altogether.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Their integration in deliberation system will certainly be developed, in particular at the acting level.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">A few of the analyzed systems consider planning primitives as executable commands; this limits the acting function mostly to reacting to events.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">However, the integration in ACT of planning and acting remains quite shallow, e.g., there is a de facto partition between planning methods and acting procedures.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">This issue of an integrated representation between planning and acting is clearly a weak point in analyzed systems (except for IDEA and T-REX with their state variables hierarchy and the continuum between acting and planning).</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">This is needed for specification, verification of consistency, and integration of planning and acting knowledge.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">The link between planning and monitoring knowledge is well advanced.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">The interesting perception planning facilities in PTL, HiPPo and other systems discussed in Section 6 and their integration to navigation and task planning have to be more widely developed and incorporated into deliberation systems.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">There will be significant progress in deliberation if more advances in different forms of reinforcement learning and learning from demonstration take place at the planning and acting levels.</a>
