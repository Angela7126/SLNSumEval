<a href="#0" id="0">We introduce the concepts of ⋆ -innocuous formulas, ⋆ -free formulas and ⋆ -conflicts, all parameterised by an arbitrary consequence operation {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ , in order to generalise the free formula and minimal inconsistent set notions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For instance, using the classical consequence operation Cn, an inconsistent {a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ K would imply {a mathematical formula}Cn( Γ )=L, and any consistent knowledge base could be the ⋆ -consolidation of Γ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The consequence operation {a mathematical formula}CnId is simply an identity function.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the first case, {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ is the identity function, and ⋆ -innocuous formulas are equal to free formulas, due to the characterisation given by Proposition 4.2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since the notion of free formula has been shown to be sometimes unsuitable to identify the “ uncontroversial ” elements in a knowledge base, we put forward the more general notion of ⋆ -innocuous formula, which is parameterised by a consequence relation {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As the example above shows, different modular {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ may yield different notions of ⋆ -conflict.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This new definition of conflict also has two extreme cases that arise from the choice of {a mathematical formula} ⊢ ⋆ (or the modular {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ ).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consider a knowledge base{a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ Kand a modular{a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ :K → K.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A formula{a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Γ is ⋆ -innocuous in Γ iff it is in no ⋆ -conflict of Γ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The result above shows that, given a modular consequence operation {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ , the formulas in a knowledge base Γ can be split into two groups: the formulas involved in some ⋆ -conflict; and the ⋆ -innocuous formulas, which are consistent with any ⋆ -consolidation {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ ∈ Cn ⋆ ( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Once more, the choice of the subclassical, Tarskian consequence operation {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ yields two extreme instances for the ⋆ -conflict concept:</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">⋆ -free formulas: those not involved in the derivation of (i.e., that do not belong to a minimal set of premises for deriving) a formula in a minimal inconsistent subset of the {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ -closure.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The equivalence between DMIS-conflicts and ⋆ -conflicts, for {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ =CnPI, does not hold, due to the fact that DMIS-conflicts are defined via weakening each formula once, while ⋆ -weakenings allow multiple consequences of the same formula.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Putting it differently, they suggest the degree of inconsistency of a knowledge base is the number of pairs {a mathematical formula} 〈 Δ , Δ ′ 〉 such that Δ is a minimal proof for {a mathematical formula}xi and {a mathematical formula} Δ ′ is a minimal proof for {a mathematical formula}¬xi.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In the other extreme, if {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ is the classical consequence operation Cn, or even a modular consequence operation such that {a mathematical formula} ⊢ ⋆ = ⊢ , then only valid formulas are ⋆ -free in inconsistent bases.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Using the consequence operations {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ =CnPm or {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ =Cn2Pm, introduced in Section 6.2, we can again employ the ⋆ -free formula concept to identify the formulas that do not contribute to the base's degree of inconsistency.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Towards that aim, we can prove that the general inconsistency measures {a mathematical formula}I ⋆ and {a mathematical formula}I ⋆ C, based on arbitrary ⋆ -conflicts, satisfy the corresponding version of the dominance property, for the corresponding {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In other words, the version of dominance satisfied by {a mathematical formula}IMIS is based on a very weak modular consequence operation: for a consistent Φ , {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ ({ Φ }) contains only tautologies besides formulas equivalent to Φ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In this section, we discuss this matter, providing computational complexity bounds for the problems of recognising ⋆ -free/innocuous formulas and ⋆ -conflicts, given some assumptions on the corresponding consequence operation {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Now we prove {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ is MIS.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Consider the set {a mathematical formula} Γ j ′ = Γ ′ ∖ { Φ j ′ } for some {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≤ m.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">As no {a mathematical formula} Φ j ∈ Γ is valid, every {a mathematical formula}¬ Φ j is satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Consequently, for any {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ j ≤ m, {a mathematical formula}¬ Φ j ∧ Ψ j is consistent, for {a mathematical formula} Ψ j is consistent and formed from different atomic propositions.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">By construction, {a mathematical formula}¬ Φ j ∧ Ψ j is disjunct in {a mathematical formula} Φ i ′ with {a mathematical formula}i ≠ j.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Therefore, a valuation satisfying {a mathematical formula}¬ Φ j ∧ Ψ j also satisfies {a mathematical formula} Γ j ′ , which must be consistent, regardless of the value of {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ j ≤ m.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">To prove by contradiction that {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ is inconsistent, suppose there is a valuation v satisfying {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ .</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">As Γ is inconsistent, {a mathematical formula}v( Φ i)=0 for some {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≤ m.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Thus, {a mathematical formula}v( Φ i ′ )=1 implies {a mathematical formula}v(¬ Φ j ∧ Ψ j)=1 for some {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ j ≤ m.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Note that {a mathematical formula}v( Ψ k)=1 implies {a mathematical formula}v( Ψ k ′ )=0 for all {a mathematical formula}k ′ ≠ k, {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ k ′ ≤ m.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Therefore, we finally have that {a mathematical formula}v( Φ j ′ )=0, a contradiction; thus {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ is a MIS.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">If a knowledge base{a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ Kis a minimal inconsistent set, then it is ⋆ -conflict.Recall that {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ must be monotonic.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Hence, {a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ MIS(Cn ⋆ ( Γ )).</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Consider the function {a mathematical formula}f: Γ → 2 Γ such that {a mathematical formula}f( Φ )={ Φ } for all {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Γ .</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">f is such that for all {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∈ Γ , {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∈ Cn ⋆ (f( Ψ ))=Cn ⋆ ({ Ψ }) and {a mathematical formula} Ψ ⊊ f( Ψ )={ Ψ } implies {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∉ Cn ⋆ ( Ψ ), because Ψ is not valid ({a mathematical formula} Ψ ∉ Cn ⋆ ( ∅ ) ⊆ Cn( ∅ )).</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">( ← ) Now suppose {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ is such that {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊢ ⋆ Ψ implies Φ and Ψ are equivalent for all consistent, non-valid {a mathematical formula} Φ , Ψ ∈ L.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Consider a knowledge base {a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ K and two formulas {a mathematical formula} Φ , Ψ ∈ L ∖ Γ such that {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊢ ⋆ Ψ and {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊬ ⊥ .</a>
