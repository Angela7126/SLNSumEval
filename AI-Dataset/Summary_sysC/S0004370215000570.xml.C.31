<a href="#0" id="0">In multi-object manipulation, the robot has to decide at each time instance which object to manipulate.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We consider problems, where the world consists of N objects with varying attributes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The total number of actions is {a mathematical formula} âˆ‘ i|Ai|, where {a mathematical formula}|Ai| denotes the number of possible actions for object i.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In each time step, the action of the robot changes the spatial locations and poses of the objects, and the robot makes an observation about the changed state of the world.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our POMDP model uses discrete actions and observations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, instead of forcing the robotic planning problem into a manageable discrete state space as is done e.g.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">in [40], we use a POMDP method based on particle filtering (discussed in Section 3.2) that allows us to maintain complex object information required for efficient multi-object manipulation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In multi-object manipulation, robot actions may have far reaching consequences: lifting first cup A and then cup B, may increase the probability of cup C being observed dirty from low to high by exposing it more fully.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The robot has to consider at each time step, whether the information gain from lifting a cup yields more reward in the long run than executing an action which may yield higher immediate reward.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Of course, because of the uncertainty in actions and observations, the real decision making problem can be even more complicated than this simple example implies.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Consequently, our hypothesis is that a heuristic greedy manipulation approach is not sufficient and that planning several time steps into the future is needed.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In order to study this hypothesis, we experimentally compared heuristic manipulation and the proposed POMDP approach with different planning horizons.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Note that even though we simulate world dynamics, we estimate the grasp and observation probabilities using the physical robot arm and real observed occlusions.</a>
