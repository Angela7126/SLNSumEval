<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, in the following counterexample we present a transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction function ÷ on a belief set K which is different from the {a mathematical formula}S filtration-based multiple contraction {a mathematical formula}÷S, for any system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the other hand, reasoning as we did in the analogous part of Counterexample 3.2 from (7) and (8) we can conclude that if {a mathematical formula}÷ ′ is a spheres filtration-based multiple contraction then the system of spheres from which it is obtained must be precisely the same system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S that arose in Counterexample 3.2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Now, assume there is a method for constructing all the transitively relational partial meet multiple contractions by means of systems of spheres and let {a mathematical formula}K ⊖ SA denote the result of contracting the belief set K by (the set of sentences) A using the above exposed system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S and applying such method.</a>

Then the class of all such contraction function does not contain the class of (all) transitively relational partial meet multiple contractions, i.e.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In what follows we present some definitions of multiple contraction functions on a belief set K which are based on a system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let K be a belief set and {a mathematical formula}S be a system of spheres centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ , the multiple contraction function {a mathematical formula}÷S2 is defined, for any set of sentences B, as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} ⊑ S2 is the binary relation on {a mathematical formula}2ML defined by:{a mathematical formula}V ′ ⊑ S2V iff for all {a mathematical formula}W ∈ V there is some {a mathematical formula}W ′ ∈ V ′ such that {a mathematical formula}S ∧ W ⊆ S ∧ W ′ and for all {a mathematical formula}R ∈ V ′ there is some {a mathematical formula}S ∈ V such that {a mathematical formula}S ∧ S ⊆ S ∧ R.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Throughout this subsection we assume that K is a belief set, {a mathematical formula}S is a system of spheres centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ and {a mathematical formula}÷S1 and {a mathematical formula}÷S2 are the multiple contraction functions whose definitions we have introduced in the previous subsection.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It does not hold in general that, given a belief setKand a system of spheres{a mathematical formula}Scentred on{a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ , the multiple contraction function{a mathematical formula}÷S1onKis identical to the multiple contraction function{a mathematical formula}÷S2onK.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">That is, for some belief setKthere is a system of spheres{a mathematical formula}Scentred on{a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ and a set of sentences A, such that{a mathematical formula}K÷S1A ≠ K÷S2A, i.e.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then the multiple contraction{a mathematical formula}÷S1onKis a transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction.We start by recalling that {a mathematical formula}÷S1 is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} ⊑ S1 is the binary relation on {a mathematical formula}2ML defined by: {a mathematical formula}V ′ ⊑ S1V iff for all {a mathematical formula}W ∈ V there is some {a mathematical formula}W ′ ∈ V ′ such that {a mathematical formula}S ∧ W ⊆ S ∧ W ′ .Now let f be such that, for any set of sentences B, {a mathematical formula}f(H( 〈 B ∩ K 〉 ))={V ∈ H( 〈 B ∩ K 〉 ): for all V ′ ∈ H( 〈 B ∩ K 〉 ),V ′ ⊑ S1V}.It follows from Theorem 5.7 that to prove that {a mathematical formula}÷S1 is a transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction it is enough to show that f is a transitively relational propositional package selection function for {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .It follows immediately from its definition that f is a function, i.e.</a>
