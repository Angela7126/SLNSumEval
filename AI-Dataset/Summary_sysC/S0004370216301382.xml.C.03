<a href="#0" id="0">Dist can also be adapted to solve WPMS, and is indeed the current best SLS algorithm for solving WPMS, winning the random WPMS category and the crafted WPMS category in the incomplete solver track of the MAX-SAT Evaluation 2014.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When to activate the hard clause weighting scheme: In this work, our CCEHC algorithm activates the hard clause weighting scheme immediately when there exists no HCSCCD variable during the search.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the basis of the framework of the CCLS algorithm and three components underlying the EHC heuristic described in Section 4, here we present a new SLS algorithm called CCEHC for solving WPMS.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this subsection, we conduct extensive experiments of our CCEHC algorithm and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors, i.e., DistUP, Dist and CCLS on all testing benchmarks, i.e., the MSE2014_WPMS_Random, MSE2014_WPMS_Crafted and MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmarks and four real-world application WPMS benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 2 presents the comparative results of our CCEHC algorithm and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors DistUP, Dist and CCLS on the MSE2014_WPMS_Random benchmark.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The comparative results of CCEHC and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors DistUP, Dist and CCLS on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and four real-world application WPMS benchmarks are summarized in Table 4.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">According to the empirical results presented in Table 4, although CCEHC performs slightly slower than CCLS on the benchmark of advanced encryption standard and performs slightly slower than DistUP and Dist on the benchmark of cluster expansion, it is very apparent that, among these four competing SLS algorithms, our CCEHC algorithm performs best on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and two real-world application WPMS benchmarks (i.e., ‘ Computational Protein Design ’ and ‘ Pedigree ’ ).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, the results of VBS present that CCEHC are complementary to WPM-2014 on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and the pedigree benchmark, which indicates that the combination of SLS algorithms and complete algorithms could achieve better performance on solving industrial WPMS instances.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hard clause weighting scheme: The CCEHC algorithm employs a clause weighting scheme that only works for hard clauses to diversify the search, while the CCLS algorithm does not use any clause weighting schemes.</a>
