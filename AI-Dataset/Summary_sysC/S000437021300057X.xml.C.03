<a href="#0" id="0">The answer {a mathematical formula}bw that worker w with error parameter {a mathematical formula} Γ w provides is governed by the following equations:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Formally, every future worker has an error parameter equal to {a mathematical formula} Γ ¯=1W ∑ w Γ w where W is the number of known workers.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If a worker answers a question of difficulty d correctly then {a mathematical formula} Γ w ← Γ x − d Δ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Workers ʼ Γ are drawn from Normal {a mathematical formula}(1.0,0.2), and we set the reward for an incorrect answer to be − 1000.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We use {a mathematical formula}bi,w to denote worker w ʼ s ballot on the ith question.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In a new TurKontrol(2) version, we do everything the same as TurKontrol(2) except we regard every worker as an anonymous worker of the same, average accuracy, {a mathematical formula} Γ ¯.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Specifically, we repeat the previous experiment using the same error coefficient, {a mathematical formula} Γ w, for each worker ʼ s improvement and ballot behavior (Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We first estimate the mean of worker w ʼ s improvement distribution, denoted by {a mathematical formula} Μ qw ′ (q).</a>
