<a href="#3" id="3">Given a CSP with only variables, domains but no problem constraints and a subset of symmetries G. ReSBDS{a mathematical formula} ≻ nParSBDS and LReSBDS{a mathematical formula} ≻ nParSBDS when all use the same static variable and value orderings and given the same set of symmetries.Suppose {a mathematical formula}CP and {a mathematical formula}CR are the sets of all symmetry breaking constraints added by ParSBDS and ReSBDS respectively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">ReSBDS{a mathematical formula} ≻ sParSBDS and LReSBDS{a mathematical formula} ≻ sParSBDS when all use the same static variable and value orderings.Lemma 3 shows all symmetry breaking constraints added by ParSBDS but not by ReSBDS cannot prune solutions.</a>
