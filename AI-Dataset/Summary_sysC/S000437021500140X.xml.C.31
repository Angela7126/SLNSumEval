<a href="#1" id="1">The actions of the agent are now expanded to be {a mathematical formula}B={A,Ba}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The normal state transition dynamics can still occur based only on A, but now the action space also must include an affective “ how ” for the delivery “ what ” of an action.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, a set of variables X represents the state of the system (e.g.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">the state of the computer application or interface).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We do not assume that this system state is directly observable, and so also use sets of observation variables {a mathematical formula} Ω x.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The state space described by X may also include affective elements.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, a student's level of frustration could be explicitly modelled within X.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In Section 4.2.2, we describe an affective prompting system that is used for a person with a cognitive disability.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this case, we explicitly represent the “ awareness ” of the person as a component of X, and the “ propositional ” actions of prompting can change the “ awareness ” of the person.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, as we discuss in Section 3.2, emotions can be computed in ACT from fundamental and transient sentiments, and so such explicit representation may not be necessary.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To predict the fundamental sentiments, we combine the deflection potential from the previous section with an “ inertial ” term that stabilises the fundamentals over time.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This gives the probabilistic generalisation of the affect control principle (Definition 1):{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Ψ (f ′ , Τ ,x)=(f ′ − M(x)G(f ′ , Τ ,x))T Σ − 1(f ′ − M(x)G(f ′ , Τ ,x)) and Ξ represents the temporal “ inertial ” dynamics of {a mathematical formula}f ′ , encoding both the stability of affective identities and the dynamics of affective behaviours.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Ξ is such that {a mathematical formula}fb ′ is equal to {a mathematical formula}ba if the agent is acting, and otherwise is unconstrained, and {a mathematical formula}fa ′ ,fc ′ are likely to be close to {a mathematical formula}fa,fc, respectively.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Equation (8) can be re-written as a set of multivariate Gaussian distributions indexed by x, with means and covariances that are non-linearly dependent on {a mathematical formula}f,ba and Τ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The full derivation is in Section 3.3.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The belief state can be used to compute expected values of quantities of interest defined on the state space, such as the expected deflection{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}D(s) is the deflection of s. This gives us a way to connect more closely with emotional “ labels ” from appraisal theories.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For example, if one wanted to compute the expected value of an emotion such as “ Joy ” in a situation with certain features (expectedness, events, persons, times), then the emotional content of that situation would be explicitly represented in our model as a distribution over the E – P – A space, {a mathematical formula}b(s), and the expected value of “ Joy ” would be {a mathematical formula}Eb(s)[Joy(s)]= ∫ sb(s)Joy(s), where {a mathematical formula}Joy(s) is the amount of joy produced by the fundamental and transient sentiment state s. In ACT, emotions are posited to arise from the difference between the transient and fundamental impressions of self-identity ({a mathematical formula} Τ a and {a mathematical formula}fa, respectively, in BayesAct).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">A separate set of equations with parameters obtained through empirical studies is presented in Chapter 14 of [1], and emotional states (e.g.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">the function {a mathematical formula}Joy(s)) can be computed directly using these equations.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Emotional displays (e.g.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">facial expressions) can be viewed as a method for communicating an agent's current appraisal of the situation in terms of affective identities that the agent perceives, and would be part of the action space {a mathematical formula}ba.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The perception of emotional displays would be simply integrated into BayesAct using observations of client identity, {a mathematical formula}Fc.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We do not further expand on direct emotion measures in this paper, but note that this may give a principled method for incorporating explicit appraisal mechanisms into BayesAct, and for linking with appraisal theories [68].</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Denote the “ normal ” or expected affective action distribution as {a mathematical formula} Π † (s)= Π † (fb):{a mathematical formula} where{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} and {a mathematical formula} Σ f † is the same as {a mathematical formula} Σ f given by Equation (24) with {a mathematical formula} Β b2(x) set to infinity (instead of zero) so the behaviour sentiments are unconstrained.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Equation (32) computes the expected distribution over {a mathematical formula}f ′ given {a mathematical formula}b(s) and then marginalises (sums) out the identity components{sup:9} to get the distribution over {a mathematical formula}fb.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">A sample drawn from this distribution could then be used as an action in the POMCP method.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">A POMCP “ rollout ” would then proceed by drawing a subsequent sample from the distribution over client actions, and then repeating the sampling from Equation (32) over agent actions.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">This is continued to some maximum depth, at which point the reward gathered is computed as the value of the path taken.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The propositional actions that update the state x are handled exhaustively as usual in POMCP by looping over them.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">We have found that a fixed affective policy may work well for some affective identities, but not for others, whereas the actions suggested by BayesAct work well across the different identities that the client may have.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">For example, if the client really does have the affective identity of a “ patient ” , then always issuing the prompts with an {a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.15,0.32,0.06] (the affective rating of the behaviour “ prompt ” in the ACT database) and otherwise simply “ minding ” the client ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.86,0.17, − 0.16]) leads to the client completing the task in an equal number of steps as BayesAct, and always completing the task within 50 steps.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">However, if the client has an affective identity that is more “ good ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[1.67,0.01, − 1.03], corresponding to “ elder ” ) or more powerful ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.48,2.16,0.94], corresponding to “ boss ” ), then this particular fixed policy does significantly worse.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Example simulations and more complete results are shown in Appendix E.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">We investigated the COACH system in simulation using an agent with an affective identity of “ assistant ” , and a client with an affective identity of “ elder ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[1.67,0.01, − 1.03]).</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">The client knows the identity of the agent, but the agent must learn the identity of the client.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Agent and client both know their own identities.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">We compare two types of policies: one where the affective actions are computed with BayesAct, and the other where the affective actions are fixed.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">We used a simple heuristic for the propositional actions where the client is prompted if the agent's belief about the client's awareness (AW) falls below 0.4.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Table E.11 shows an example simulation between the agent and a client (PwD) who holds the affective identity of “ elder ” .</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">This identity is more powerful and more good than that of “ patient ” (the default).</a>
