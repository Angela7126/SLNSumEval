<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search [3] uses admissible heuristics that provide a lower bound on the distance from a state to the goal to reduce the number of expanded states.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Regression in planning is commonly thought to be less robust than progression due to (a) the existence of multiple goal states, which requires considering partially-defined states (i.e., in which the value of some variables is unknown) and (b) the impact that states unreachable from the initial state have on backward search [7].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Symbolic search aims to alleviate this problem by reasoning about sets of states, represented by efficient data-structures like Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) [8], instead of individual states.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, a partial state p can be defined as a set of facts and is associated with the set of states that satisfy the partial assignment, {a mathematical formula}{s|p[v]=s[v] ∀ v ∈ Vp}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We denote as {a mathematical formula}p|V ′ the projection of p to the set of variables {a mathematical formula}V ′ ⊆ Vp, i.e., as the partial assignment over {a mathematical formula}V ′ having the same value as p for variables it is defined for.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">While applicability of operators in progression is defined over complete states, in order to perform regression from the goals of the problem we define the reversed applicability over partial states.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An operator {a mathematical formula}o ∈ O is applicable in a partial state p over {a mathematical formula}Vp in regression if p is consistent with the operator effects and prevails, {a mathematical formula} ∀ v ∈ Vp:(v ∉ Veff(o) or p[v]=eff(o)[v]) and (v ∉ Vprev(o) or p[v]=prev(o)[v]) and is relevant to p, {a mathematical formula}Vp ∩ Veff(o) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams, BDDs for short, are the most popular data structure to represent the logical formulæ employed in symbolic search [8].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The application of reduction rules provides up to exponential memory gains in the number of variables when representing some functions with respect to the number of states it represents.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Theoretical analyses on the complexity of representing those states in some planning domains and games have proved them to have polynomial upper bounds and exponential lower bounds on the number of nodes needed to represent different relevant sets of states on different domains [18], [19], [20].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The algorithm may stop when the sum of the minimum g values of generated states for the forward and backward searches is at least {a mathematical formula}wtotal, the cost of the cheapest solution path found so far.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Multiple variants of {a mathematical formula}BDDA ⁎ exist across the literature, varying the representation of state sets involved in the search.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The image operation of a set of states with respect to a given transition relation can be decomposed into basic logical operations over BDDs: {a mathematical formula}image(S,T):=( ∃ x(S ∧ T))[x ′ /x].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The conjunction {a mathematical formula}S ∧ T corresponds tow all pairs of states {a mathematical formula} 〈 s,s ′ 〉 such that {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S and {a mathematical formula}s ′ =o(s) for an operator o represented by T. Then, the existential quantification ignores predecessor states and the variable swapping, {a mathematical formula}[x ′ /x], represents the resulting states {a mathematical formula}s ′ with the standard set of variables x.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Moreover, since according to the semantics of a planning operator the effect does not depend on the predecessor state, {a mathematical formula}To can be divided into a precondition {a mathematical formula}Topre over x and an effect {a mathematical formula}Toeff over {a mathematical formula}x ′ such that {a mathematical formula}To=Topre ∧ Toeff.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This way the variables representing the successor states {a mathematical formula}x ′ as well as the swap operation are no longer needed, reducing the size of intermediate BDDs and speeding up image computation.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Every internal node is associated with a variable {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V and has an edge for every value i of v and an additional “ don't care ” edge.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">An operator {a mathematical formula}o ∈ O is propagated down the i edge if and only if {a mathematical formula} 〈 v=i 〉 ∈ pre(o) and down the “ don't care ” edge if {a mathematical formula}v ∉ Vpre(o).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">At every inner node one recursive call is made for each child node, applying the corresponding conjunction between the set of states S and the precondition {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V associated with the node.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">{a mathematical formula}CT has several advantages over the baseline approach: first, if S does not contain any state matching the conditions of a branch of the tree, all the operators regarding that branch are ignored, which reduces the number of individual image operations that are needed.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Thus, {a mathematical formula}Union(T) may be computed as shown in Equation (2), where {a mathematical formula}XT and {a mathematical formula}XT are the sets of variables in the effects of operators represented by the transition relation T and any transition relation in the set {a mathematical formula}T, respectively.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">An operator is valid if it is consistent with the constraints, i.e., exist s, {a mathematical formula}s ′ s.t.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Using {a mathematical formula}Toc with relevant constraints suffices to guarantee that the successor set does not contain invalid states as long as the source set does not either.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We may deduce condition (2) assuming that M is relevant for o in regression, i.e., there exists a state s such that {a mathematical formula}M ⊨ o(s) and {a mathematical formula}M ⊭ s.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Prune transitions {a mathematical formula}s Α → ot Α when the abstract states, {a mathematical formula}s Α and {a mathematical formula}t Α , are incompatible with the semantics of the operator,{sup:5} i.e., when the operator can only be applied on invalid states in {a mathematical formula}s Α or its application on a valid state from {a mathematical formula}s Α leads to an invalid state in {a mathematical formula}t Α .</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Another remarkable difference (applicable to explicit-state search too) is that, while relevance constraints are redundant in regression and do not provide additional pruning in backward search, in the abstract space those constraints may be violated.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">We do not contemplate this possibility since it would require maintaining different cBDDs, one per operator, and it cannot be combined with methods of image computation that represent multiples operators in the same TR as explained in Section 4.4.</a>
