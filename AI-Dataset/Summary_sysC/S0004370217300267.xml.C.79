<a href="#0" id="0">Defeasible argument is used during the initial construction of a proof, and as the proof is refined or changed over time to reflect conceptual changes in the underlying theory, or to rectify deductive errors discovered after a proof is commonly accepted – all themes that Lakatos emphasised [55].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This shows how off-the-shelf technologies can produce a pipeline system, running from natural language dialogue about the construction of a mathematical proof, to philosophical theory, to the formal expression of natural language reasoning in dialogue games, and from there to abstract argumentation and argumentation semantics, and finally, coming full circle, to show that implementations of these systems can then provide value back to the mathematical community from which the philosophical theory was derived.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">arguing that (i) there is a logic of discovery, i.e., the process of generating conjectures and proof ideas is subject to rational laws; and, (ii) a sharp distinction between discovery and justification is misleading as each affects the other.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If it is both global and local, i.e., there is a problem both with the argument and the conclusion, then the move consists in modifying the conjecture by incorporating the problematic proof step as a condition.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If it is local but not global, i.e., the conclusion may still be correct but the reasons for believing it are flawed, then the move consists in modifying the problematic proof step but leaving the conjecture unchanged.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If it is global but not local, i.e., there is a problem with the conclusion but no obvious flaw in the reasoning which led to the conclusion, then the move consists in looking for a hidden assumption in the proof step, then modifying the proof and the conjecture by making the assumption an explicit condition.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, in the portion of the Euler conjecture discussion treated in Section 7, the Teacher remarks with respect to a local counterexample: “ I no longer contend that the removal of any triangle follows one of the two patterns mentioned, but merely that at each stage of the removing operation the removal of any boundary triangle follows one of these patterns … I can easily improve the proof, by replacing the false lemma by a slightly modified one, which your counterexample will not refute. ” The discussion can then continue in the same fashion as when the initial problem and proof were proposed.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The dialogue system consists of several sets of rules, amongst which the most typically used there are: (1) locution rules which describe what type of utterances players can execute during a dialogue; (2) structural rules or protocol which determine the interaction between locutions (i.e., it specifies which locution can be performed as a reply to another locution){sup:3}; (3) commitment or effect rules which specify for each utterance Φ the effects which this locution makes on a set of commitments of the participant i (a commitment of i is a sentence that i publicly declared as his belief){sup:4}; (4) termination rules which determine the cases where no move is legal, i.e.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Structured argumentation aims to “ give a general structured account of argumentation that is intermediate in its level of abstraction between concrete logics and the fully abstract level, providing guidance on the structure of arguments, the nature of attacks, and the use of preferences, while at the same time accommodating a broad range of instantiating logics and allowing for the study of conditions under which the various desirable properties are satisfied by these instantiations ” [66, p. 31].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Note that the main difference between the strategy of modifying the conjecture and the strategy of modifying a concept in this conjecture lies in the consequences of these moves for a theory in which the proof is conducted.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As a consequence of this normative-descriptive balance, the Lakatos Game provides a good test case for AIF, which similarly aims to handle both analysis of linguistic material as well as representation and evaluation of the norms of discourse context [25].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">These argument structures should be submittable to a simple, algorithmic procedure which will yield precisely the theory that represents the current shared understanding at any point in the game.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Instead though, {a mathematical formula}HybridCounter uses a simpler characterisation of attack between m and c, introducing a CA directly, rather than adding an argument for the negation of the conjecture.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{a mathematical formula}GlobalLemmaInc-orporation makes explicit a hidden assumption by adding it as a new lemma, k. It is also responsible for introducing the conflict between the counterexample, m (identified in the preceding {a mathematical formula}GlobalCounter) and this new lemma.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">{a mathematical formula}PDefinition allows Proponent to offer a definition, d captured as a proposition in the AIF structure, which is then linked through an inference to the reason, r for barring or adjusting a monster (from a {a mathematical formula}MonsterBar or {a mathematical formula}MonsterAdjust move).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula}ODefinition allows Opponent to offer an alternative definition, which requires update to the AIF structure not only to include the new definition, e, but also (i) the conflict with Proponent's definition and (ii) the inference from e to Opponent's reason, s, for thinking the counterexample holds.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The approach described in this section shows how as a Lakatos Game is executed, AIF structures are created which, when translated to {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+, produce abstract argumentation frameworks which under grounded semantics have as acceptable arguments all and only those elements which correspond to the mathematical theory accepted by the participants at a given stage of the game.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Though other single extension semantics could be employed, it turns out that the strong, sceptical interpretation provided by grounded semantics deliver precisely the results required,as will be shown in this and the following sections.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Second, by virtue of the relationship between {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ and abstract argumentation, we show updates to an abstract framework for the Lakatos Game LG, {a mathematical formula}AFLG= 〈 ARLG,attacksLG 〉 , comprising a set of abstract arguments {a mathematical formula}ARLG and a relation of attacks {a mathematical formula}attacksLG over them following Dung [32].</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Finally, the updates to the grounded extension of the argumentation framework, {a mathematical formula}GELG, are computed and compared with the status of the theory defined by the locution rules of LG.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The protocol demands that {a mathematical formula}Prefer can only be executed after both Proponent and Opponent have offered definitions, which in turn can only occur in a MonsterBar-PDefinition-MonsterReject-ODefinition series.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The definition of {a mathematical formula}Prefer(m,r,f,g) allows us to capture these abstract consequences independently of the speaker, expressing that f is preferred to g (and in the abstract, that Η founded on f is preferred to Γ founded on g), regardless of which of f and g are instantiated with d or e. The effect of adding a preference into the structured argumentation is to remove one of the pair of symmetrical attacks in the abstract framework.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In the remainder of this section, we work step by step through this dialogue and show how our protocol both, covers all of the moves made, and, at the same time, produces updates to the generated the Argument Interchange Format structure and argumentation structure which capture the status of the proof after each turn of the dialogue.</a>
