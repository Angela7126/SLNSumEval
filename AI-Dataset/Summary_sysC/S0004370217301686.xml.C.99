<a href="#0" id="0">For the sake of completeness, let us first show that Mod is decreasing (Property 1): let us assume {a mathematical formula}T ⊆ T ′ , then {a mathematical formula} ∀ M ∈ Mod(T ′ ) we have {a mathematical formula} ∀ Φ ∈ T, Φ ∈ T ′ , and thus {a mathematical formula}M ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, satisfaction systems are Tarskian according to the definition of logics given by Tarski: a logic is a pair {a mathematical formula}(L,Cn) where {a mathematical formula}L is a set of expressions (formulas) and {a mathematical formula}Cn:P(L) → P(L) is a mapping that satisfies the inclusion, iteration and monotonicity properties [40].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Indeed, from any satisfaction system {a mathematical formula}R we can define the following Tarskian logic {a mathematical formula}(L,Cn) where {a mathematical formula}L=Sen and Cn is the mapping that associates to every {a mathematical formula}T ⊆ Sen, the set {a mathematical formula}Cn(T) of semantic consequences of T.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is not required for {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T to be a pre-order.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As shown below, the only important feature to have to make a correspondence between a FA and the fact that ∘ satisfies the weakened AGM Postulates is that there is a minimal model for {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T in {a mathematical formula}Mod(T ′ ) as expressed by Theorem 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A formula relaxation based on Ρ , denoted {a mathematical formula} Ρ F Ρ is defined as follows, for any two complex concepts C and D, any individuals {a mathematical formula}a,b, and any role r:{a mathematical formula} Note that the relaxation of the role assertion axiom amounts to delete it from the knowledge base, since a tautology is satisfied by any model.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Formula relaxation based on concept retractionA formula relaxation based on a concept retraction Κ , denoted {a mathematical formula} Ρ F Κ , is defined as follows, for any two complex concepts C and D, any individuals {a mathematical formula}a,b, and any role r:{a mathematical formula} Similarly, the relaxation of the concept assertion amounts to delete it from the knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For every knowledge base T, let us define the binary relation {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T ⊆ Mod×Mod by: for all {a mathematical formula}M,M ′ ∈ Mod,{a mathematical formula}Let us first show that {a mathematical formula} ⪯ T satisfies the two conditions of FA.</a>
