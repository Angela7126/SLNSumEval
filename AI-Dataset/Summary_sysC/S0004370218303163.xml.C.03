<a href="#0" id="0">The knowledge of the domain is described as a set of abstraction patterns as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}h Ψ (Ah,Thb,The) is an observable of the domain playing the role of a hypothesis on the observation of an underlying process Ψ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}m1(A1,T1), … ,mn(An,Tn) is a set of observables of the domain which plays the role of the evidence suggesting the observation of {a mathematical formula}h Ψ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">C is a set of constraints among the variables involved in the abstraction pattern, which are interpreted as necessary conditions in order for the evidence {a mathematical formula}m1(A1,T1), … ,mn(An,Tn) to be abstracted into {a mathematical formula}h Ψ (Ah,Thb,The).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We call {a mathematical formula}Q={q0,q1, … ,qn} the set of observables of a particular domain.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We call {a mathematical formula}O the set of observations available for the observables in {a mathematical formula}Q.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A sequence of observations is an ordered set of observations {a mathematical formula}O=(o1, … ,oi, … ) where for all {a mathematical formula}i<j then {a mathematical formula}oi<oj.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We model an abstraction process as an abduction process, based on the conjectural relation {a mathematical formula}m ← h[21], which can be read as ‘ the observation of the finding m allows us to conjecture the observation of h as a possible explanatory hypothesis ’ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Every constraint {a mathematical formula}Ci ∈ CP is a relation defined on a subset of the set of variables taking part in the set of findings and the hypothesis {a mathematical formula}{Ah,Thb,The,A1,T1b,T1e, … ,An,Tnb,Tne}.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We will denote each constraint by making reference to the set of variables being constrained, as in {a mathematical formula}CP(Ah,Thb,The,A1,T1b,T1e, … ,An,Tnb,Tne) for the whole abstraction pattern.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">An abstraction pattern establishes, through the set {a mathematical formula}CP, the conditions for conjecturing the observation of h from a set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP, and through the observation procedure {a mathematical formula} Θ P, the calculations for producing a new observation {a mathematical formula}oh ∈ O(h) from the observation of these findings.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">According to the definition, an abstraction pattern is defined over a fixed set of evidence findings {a mathematical formula}MP.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The set {a mathematical formula}Q of observables can be considered as an alphabet.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let {a mathematical formula}Gap be the class of formal grammars of abstraction patterns.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Given a grammar {a mathematical formula}G ∈ Gap, we devise a constructive method for generating a set of abstraction patterns {a mathematical formula}PG={P1, … ,Pi, … }.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Informally, an interpretation problem arises from the availability of a set of initial observations from a given system, and of domain knowledge formalized as a set {a mathematical formula}G={Gq1, … ,Gqn} of {a mathematical formula}Gap grammars.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Every abstraction grammar {a mathematical formula}Gh ∈ G generates a set of abstraction patterns that share the same hypothesis h. The whole set of abstraction patterns that can be generated by {a mathematical formula}G is denoted as {a mathematical formula}P.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Let {a mathematical formula}Q be a set of observables and {a mathematical formula}G a set of abstraction grammars.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We say {a mathematical formula}G induces an abstraction relation in {a mathematical formula}Q×Q, denoted by {an inline-figure} if and only if there exists an abstraction pattern P generated by some {a mathematical formula}Gh ∈ G such that:</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">{a mathematical formula}qj=h</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We denote by {an inline-figure} an abstraction sequence in n steps that allows the conjecture of {a mathematical formula}qj from {a mathematical formula}qi.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This order relation defines an abstraction hierarchy among the observables in {a mathematical formula}Q.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">It is worth noting that the abstraction relation is only established between observables in the {a mathematical formula}AP set.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">We define an abstraction model as a tuple {an inline-figure}, where {a mathematical formula}Q is the set of domain observables, {an inline-figure} is an abstraction relation between such observables, and {a mathematical formula}G is the available knowledge as a set of abstraction grammars.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We define an interpretation problem as a pair {a mathematical formula}IP= 〈 O,M 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}O=(o1,o2, … ,oi, … ) is a sequence of observations requiring interpretation and {a mathematical formula}M is an abstraction model of the domain.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">As discussed above, any observable {a mathematical formula}q ∈ QP can appear multiple times as different pieces of evidence for an abstraction pattern P, in the form of findings collected in the set {a mathematical formula}MP.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">As a consequence, P can predict multiple observations of the set {a mathematical formula}O for a given observable {a mathematical formula}q ∈ QP, each of these corresponding to one of the findings of the set {a mathematical formula}MP through a matching relation.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">From the notion of matching relation we can design a mechanism for abductively interpreting a subset of observations in {a mathematical formula}O through the use of abstraction patterns.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Given an interpretation problem IP, we define an abstraction hypothesis as a tuple {a mathematical formula} Ħ = 〈 oh,P, ↢ 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}P= 〈 h,MP,CP, Θ P 〉 ∈ P, {a mathematical formula} ↢ ⊆ MP×O, and we denote {a mathematical formula}O Ħ =codomain( ↢ ), satisfying:</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">{a mathematical formula}oh ∈ O(h).</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">An abstraction hypothesis defines in the set of observations {a mathematical formula}O a counterpart of the subsets {a mathematical formula}AP and {a mathematical formula}EP of the set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP of a pattern P, resulting from the selection of a set of observations {a mathematical formula}O Ħ ⊆ O by means of a matching relation, satisfying those requirements shown in the Definition 11.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Given an interpretation problem IP and an abstraction hypothesis {a mathematical formula} Ħ = 〈 oh,P, ↢ 〉 , we define the following sets of observations:</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">We denote by {a mathematical formula}evidence_of(oh) the set of all observations supporting a specific hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">The definition of these sets can be generalized to include as arguments a set of observations {a mathematical formula}O={oh1, … ,ohm} from a set of abstraction hypotheses {a mathematical formula} Ħ 1, … , Ħ m:</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">As a result of an abstraction hypothesis, a new observation {a mathematical formula}oh is generated which can be included in the set of domain observations, so that {a mathematical formula}O=O ∪ {oh}.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Given an interpretation problem IP, an interpretation is defined as a set of abstraction hypotheses {a mathematical formula}I={ Ħ 1, … , Ħ m}.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Indeed, the definition of interpretation is actually weak, since even an empty set {a mathematical formula}I= ∅ is formally a valid interpretation.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Given an interpretation problem IP, two different abstraction hypotheses Ħ and {a mathematical formula} Ħ ′ of the mutually exclusive observables {a mathematical formula}qh and {a mathematical formula}qh ′ are alternative hypotheses if and only if {a mathematical formula}abstracted_by(oh) ∩ abstracted_by(oh ′ ) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Thus, {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) is an interpretation problem according to this definition.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">In addition, for all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S there exists an abstraction hypothesis {a mathematical formula} Ħ = 〈 oh,P, ↢ 〉 such that:</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">↢ provides a valid assignment, since the set of observations satisfying {a mathematical formula} Θ P=true also satisfies the constraints in {a mathematical formula}CP.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Since each abstraction hypothesis involves a different abstraction pattern there are no alternative hypotheses in any interpretation of {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S).Suppose there is a set covering {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ S of U of size k or less.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">That is, the set of abstraction hypotheses I is an exclusive cover of the interpretation problem {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) of size k or less.Following the same reasoning as for the set covering optimization problem, finding a minimal and a exclusive cover of an interpretation problem {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) is NP-hard, since we can use the solution of this problem to check whether there is an exclusive cover of the interpretation problem of size k or less, and this has been proven above to be NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">This {a mathematical formula}open list is initialized with the trivial interpretation {a mathematical formula}I0= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">The result of ABDUCE() is a set of interpretations {a mathematical formula}I ′ , each one adding a new abstraction hypothesis with respect to the parent interpretation I.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">Then, for each grammar, each production including the corresponding observable {a mathematical formula}q(oi) (line 4) initializes an abstraction pattern with a single finding of this observable (line 5), and a new hypothesis is conjectured with a matching relation involving both the observation under focus and the finding (line 6).</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Let us consider the interpretation problem set out in Example 5.1 and the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I0 shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">The abstraction pattern that supports this operation is {a mathematical formula}PN, and a matching relation is established with the {a mathematical formula}mPw finding.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">6 shows the result of this reasoning process, in a new interpretation called {a mathematical formula}I1.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">This reasoning mode is applied when the attention is focused on an observation {a mathematical formula}oh previously conjectured as part of an abstraction hypothesis Ħ (see Algorithm 4).</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">Let us consider the interpretation problem set out in Example 5.1 and the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I1 shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">The SUBSUME() function explores the set of observations {a mathematical formula}O and selects those consistent with the constraints on the finding in the focus of attention (line 3), expanding the matching relation of the corresponding hypothesis in different descendant interpretations (line 4).</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">Let us consider the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I2 shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">If we apply the subsumption procedure, it is possible to set a matching relation between {a mathematical formula}oQRS and {a mathematical formula}mQRS, since this observation satisfies all the constraints on the finding.</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">The result is shown in the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I3.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">Starting from the {a mathematical formula}I3 interpretation shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">6 as {a mathematical formula}I6.</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">Constraint solving assigns the value of {a mathematical formula}tTwb, {a mathematical formula}tTwe and {a mathematical formula}tNe, so the result is a cover of the initial interpretation problem in which all the hypotheses have a necessary and sufficient set of evidence.</a>
