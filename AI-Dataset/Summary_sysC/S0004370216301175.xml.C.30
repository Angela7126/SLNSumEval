<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}X ⊂ L is the set of all possible alternatives;</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula} Σ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Σ 2 be two argumental structures in W, then{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}dlits( Σ ) ⊆ C is the set of distinguished literals that are contained in arguments of an argumental structure Σ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have shown in Example 5 that given a working set of arguments {a mathematical formula}Wr, the available evidence {a mathematical formula}Er will determine a set {a mathematical formula}Activer ⊆ Wr with the current set of active arguments.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then, the conflict relation {a mathematical formula} ⋈ r and the preference function {a mathematical formula}prefr are used for determining the set {a mathematical formula}Warrantedr ⊆ Activer of the current warranted arguments.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We will introduce next the decision component of our framework; this component will use the justified conclusions supported by arguments in {a mathematical formula}Warrantedr to determine which alternatives will be selected.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We will formalize now the decision component Γ of our proposed abstract decision framework {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,C,>C,K, Γ 〉 L, and we will propose an algorithm for computing the selecting alternatives.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As we have mentioned, the decision component is a set of decision rules that will effectively implement the agent's decision making policy.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Decision rules [27], that will be used to decide among alternatives from a choice experiment {a mathematical formula}B ⊆ X, are formalized in following definition.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Then, to determine which alternatives will be selected from a choice experiment B it is necessary to consider all the decision rules from Γ that are applicable with respect to the justified conclusions that can be inferred from the active arguments of {a mathematical formula}K. The set of acceptable alternatives can be defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Set of acceptable alternativesLet {a mathematical formula}B ⊆ X be a set of alternatives posed to the agent and {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,C,>C,K, Γ 〉 be the agent's decision framework.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then, the set of acceptable alternatives {a mathematical formula} Ω B of the agent will be defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">That is because the algorithm assigns to each set of alternatives {a mathematical formula}B ∈ B a non-empty set that represents the alternatives that the decision maker might choose when presented with the alternatives in B.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To introduce next result, Algorithm 1 will be considered as the function {a mathematical formula} Μ ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) with two arguments: an abstract decision framework and a set of alternatives.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let{a mathematical formula} 〈 X,C,>C,K, Γ 〉 Lbe an abstract decision framework, where{a mathematical formula}K= 〈 E,W, ⋈ ,pref 〉 .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Given the set{a mathematical formula}Bwhich contains all the possible choice experiment, and function{a mathematical formula} Μ ( ⋅ , ⋅ )described inAlgorithm 1, if{a mathematical formula}>Cis a strict total order among elements of{a mathematical formula}C, then the choice structure ({a mathematical formula}B,{a mathematical formula} Μ ( ⋅ , ⋅ )) satisfies the weak axiom of revealed preference.</a>

<a href="#17" id="17">The set of arguments belonging to Σ is denoted as {a mathematical formula}args( Σ ).</a>
