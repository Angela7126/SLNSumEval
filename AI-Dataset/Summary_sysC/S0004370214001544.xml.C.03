<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we have designed, implemented, and analyzed a framework that allows us to envision the physical effects of robot manipulation actions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Based on such information, a robot has to understand the nature of the task, that is, it has to reason about how the physical effects of a manipulation action depend on the way the action is executed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, to perform the task itself, the robot has to understand how its own manipulation actions produce physical effects.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Through envisioning a robot can learn a mapping between different context conditions and qualitative action effects.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">During the pouring action, the robot could spill some pancake mix onto the table or it could pour the mix onto the pancake maker with lots of splashes.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">6 shows the robot Rosie pushing the spatula under pancake and envisioning the action through mental simulation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In addition, we have integrated methods for making simulation-based temporal projections into Prolog's backtracking mechanism in order to perform reasoning about action parameterizations for robot manipulation tasks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Similarly, our work proposes a simulation-based approach for naive physics reasoning for robot manipulation tasks.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In addition, the robot provides an instantiated action plan based on the plan's corresponding parameter space for pouring the ready-to-use pancake mix onto the pancake maker, flipping the half-baked pancake and placing the fully-baked pancake onto a plate.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, based on the envisioned timeline the robot is able to evaluate its parameterized action plan with respect to various performance measures, for example, whether the pancake mix was poured onto the pancake maker without spilling.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">One of the main constituents of the envisioning process is a physics-based simulation in which a specified robot performs manipulation actions according to its parameterized action plan.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Reasoning about everyday object manipulation requires robots to understand the spatial and physical configurations of objects and their parts over time.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula} For example, the event of cooking the pancake mix is formalized as{a mathematical formula} Actions of a robot can be represented similarly.</a>
