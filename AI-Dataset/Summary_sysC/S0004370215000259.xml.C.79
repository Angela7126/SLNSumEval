<a href="#0" id="0">For example, in the Machine Reading task [40], the goal is to answer questions that require a deep knowledge of individual short texts and in which systems are required to choose one answer, by analyzing the corresponding test document in conjunction with background text collections.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Answer candidates are extracted using a “ relaxed ” unification method that takes advantage of Prolog unification, which allows to assign high scores to perfect matches between terms of the question and passage, and low scores for less perfect matches obtained by relaxed unification.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We were inspired by those previous approaches to build the virtual player for the WWBM game, and we borrowed most of the techniques adopted in the AVE task, such as techniques based on lexical processing and computation of an approximate match between passages of text and candidate answers (Section 6).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We finally decided to avoid using that filter because, after the selection of the most relevant passages to a specific question, we expect that the candidate answer is already contained in one of the passages, and the filters based on pure lexical comparison are sufficient to properly select and score it.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The result obtained for English is similar to that achieved in [25], in which the system correctly answered about {a mathematical formula}75% of questions, even though a different and smaller dataset was used.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence, in order to evaluate how much effective that strategy is, we have evaluated on one hand the accuracy of regular expressions at correctly detecting negative questions, and on the other hand the effectiveness of the reverse scoring method.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The accuracy of the heuristics based on the use of regular expressions is {a mathematical formula}F1=89.23% for the Italian dataset, and {a mathematical formula}F1=98.20% for the English one, while the reverse scoring method was evaluated by taking into account the percentage of negative questions for which the reverse scoring strategy was useful (i.e.</a>
