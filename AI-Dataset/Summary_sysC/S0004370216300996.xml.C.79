<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, by further introducing a one-dimensional array nbGic that associates with each variable x of the CN the number of values in {a mathematical formula}dom(x) that have been proved to be GIC, it is possible to avoid some iterations of loop 5; see initialization at lines 2 – 3, testing at line 4 and update at line 4 of Algorithm 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Completeness of GIC1 is obvious: searchSolutionFor is called for all values (line 3), so if a value {a mathematical formula}(x,a) is not GIC, it will necessarily be removed in line 5.In GIC2 (Algorithm 4), a value {a mathematical formula}(x,a) is let in the domain without checking if it belongs to a solution when {a mathematical formula}nbGic[x] ≥ |dom(x)| (line 4) or {a mathematical formula}stamp[x][a] ≥ time (line 5).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For each decision {a mathematical formula} Δ i, it is easy to identify the set {a mathematical formula}deleted( Δ i) of values deleted due to the combined effect of {a mathematical formula} Δ i and constraint propagation: we have {a mathematical formula}deleted( Δ i)=values(Ni − 1) ∖ values(Ni).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the latter case, the interval {a mathematical formula}j − 1..p bounds the different possibilities (the value cannot be deleted at a level less than {a mathematical formula}j − 1 and possibly can remain valid at the end of the new trace).</a>
