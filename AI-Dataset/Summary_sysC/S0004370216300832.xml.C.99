<a href="#0" id="0">However, unfortunately, local search algorithms for PMS do not benefit much from local search techniques for SAT and MaxSAT, mainly due to the fact that it contains both hard and soft clauses.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This feature makes it more challenging to design efficient local search algorithms for PMS, which is likely the reason of the stagnation of this direction in more than one decade.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we propose a number of new ideas for local search for PMS, which mainly rely on the distinction between hard and soft clauses.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The first three ideas, including weighting for hard clauses, separating hard and soft score, and a variable selection heuristic based on hard and soft score, are used to develop a local search algorithm for PMS called Dist.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In detail, we compare Dist with its four alternative versions, and the experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the ideas; more interestingly, all alternatives based on separation of hard and soft score have better performance than previous local search algorithms, indicating separation of hard and soft score is an essential technique and opens up a new direction for local search algorithms for PMS (and also weighted PMS).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A common variable property used in local search algorithms for weighted MaxSAT is the {a mathematical formula}score property, which is defined as the change on the total weight of satisfied clauses caused by flipping the variable.</a>
