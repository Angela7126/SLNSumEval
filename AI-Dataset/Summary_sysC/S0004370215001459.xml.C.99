<a href="#0" id="0">Although several hybrid methods exist that search for a small subset of the training set, and simultaneously achieve the elimination of noisy and superfluous cases, competence enhancement and competence preservation methods can be combined to achieve the same objectives as hybrid methods [6].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since it is impossible to enumerate all possible future target problems, in practice the case-base itself is assumed to be a representative sample of the underlying distribution of target problems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a result, the coverage of a case is estimated by the set of cases that can be solved by its retrieval and adaptation (Definition 1), and the reachability of a case is estimated by the set of cases that can bring about its solution (Definition 2).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Considering {a mathematical formula} ℘ ( ℜ CB(CB)) as the measurable space {a mathematical formula}A, for {a mathematical formula}A ∈ A, we define the competence-based empirical weight of {a mathematical formula}Si with regard to A over CB as{a mathematical formula} In essence, the competence-based drift detection method partitions the problem space into a group of overlapping related sets, and then estimates the empirical probability over a competence area represented by A – a sub-set of {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(CB) through competence-based empirical weight.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The higher the weight is, the larger is the proportion of cases in S that support the selected competence area − A.For two case sample sets {a mathematical formula}S1,S2 ⊆ CB and a Related Set{a mathematical formula}r ∈ ℜ CB(S1) ∪ ℜ CB(S2), letting {a mathematical formula} ℜ ={r}, we define the RelatedSet-based empirical distance of r between {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 as{a mathematical formula}With the definition of the RelatedSet-based empirical distance, the competence-based empirical distance between{a mathematical formula}S1and{a mathematical formula}S2,{a mathematical formula}dCB(S1,S2)=supA ∈ A ⁡ |S1CB(A) − S2CB(A)|can be computed as{a mathematical formula}where{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When working with other change detection methods which have no capacity to locate concept drifts, all new cases will be exempt from removal, which is also the case when {a mathematical formula}p=0 in Definition 8.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">There are three reasons for us to use a different way of constructing the competence model for change detection purposes: 1) While performing change detection, the competence model should reflect the current competence contribution of each case.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">While performing case-base editing, the competence model should reflect the maximum contribution of each case, since cases may be removed at any time.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Table 2 shows a summary of the test data across each month for both datasets.Similar to Spam Filtering – static, each email {a mathematical formula}ei is represented by a vector of features {a mathematical formula}ei= 〈 x1,x2, ⋯ ,xn 〉 , where each feature is binary, and we use the same similarity as described in Experiment 1.Since error rate is not a good metric for skewed datasets, the most common effectiveness metrics [66] for spam filtering are used to evaluate effectiveness, where Legitimate Recall (LR) is defined as {a mathematical formula}LR=TNTN+FP=TNN, and Legitimate Precision (LP) is defined as {a mathematical formula}LP=TNTN+FN, where FP means legitimate emails that are incorrectly classified as spam, and FN means spam emails that are incorrectly classified as legitimate.In this experiment, we again compare our algorithm with two closely related concept handling methods, IB3 [50] and PECS [53], as well as other well-known competence enhancement methods designed for static tasks, ENN [33] and BBNR [5], and the Full Base which performs no noise removal at all.</a>
