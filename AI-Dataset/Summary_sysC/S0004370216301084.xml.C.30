<a href="#0" id="0">Our main result in this section is the following, which shows that if each player (or agent of a player) uses such an update algorithm, the system quickly converges, in the sense that the value of the potential function {a mathematical formula} Φ (xt) quickly approaches the minimum {a mathematical formula} Φ (q), where {a mathematical formula}q=arg ⁡ minz ∈ K ⁡ Φ (z).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consider any nonatomic congestion game of n players with parameters given in Section2, and let{a mathematical formula} Λ =mbk.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now if each player i plays the gradient descent algorithm by starting from any{a mathematical formula}xi0 ∈ Kiand using any{a mathematical formula} Η i ∈ [ Η ,1/ Λ ], then{a mathematical formula}T Ε ≤ 2/(n Η Ε ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, if each player i plays the multiplicative update algorithm by starting from a uniform{a mathematical formula}xi0(same load on each allowed path) and using any{a mathematical formula} Η i ∈ [ Η ,1/ Λ ], then{a mathematical formula}T Ε ≤ (nln ⁡ (dn))/( Η Ε ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We consider the same function for the convergence purpose:{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}x ∈ K, where{a mathematical formula} with {a mathematical formula} ℓ ( ⋅ ) being the same function defined in (3).</a>
