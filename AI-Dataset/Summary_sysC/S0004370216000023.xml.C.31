<a href="#8" id="8">Such definition makes use of the concept of {a mathematical formula}Sfiltration of a set of sentences B,{sup:6} where {a mathematical formula}S is a system of spheres centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ , for some given belief set K:</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">The {a mathematical formula}Sfiltration-based multiple contraction onK is the multiple contraction function {a mathematical formula}÷S defined by:{a mathematical formula} for any set of sentences B and where {a mathematical formula}BS is the {a mathematical formula}S filtration of B.</a>

<a href="#15" id="15">Next, by means of another counterexample, we show that the converse inclusion does not hold either, i.e.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">that not all TRPMMCs are spheres filtration-based multiple contractions.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Thus, in the following counterexample we present a transitively relational partial meet multiple contraction function ÷ on a belief set K which is different from the {a mathematical formula}S filtration-based multiple contraction {a mathematical formula}÷S, for any system of spheres {a mathematical formula}S centred on {a mathematical formula} ‖ K ‖ .</a>
