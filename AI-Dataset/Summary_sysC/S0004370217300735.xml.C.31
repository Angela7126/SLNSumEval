<a href="#0" id="0">We refer to the latent variables in the flat model from the first step as level 1 latent variables.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The objective of the second step (line 9) is to turn the level 1 latent variables into observed variables through data completion.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To do so, the subroutine HardAssignment carries out inference to compute the posterior distribution of each latent variable for each document.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The document is assigned to the state with the highest posterior probability, resulting in a dataset {a mathematical formula}D1 over the level 1 latent variables.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To perform UD-test on a set {a mathematical formula}S of observed variables, we first learn two latent tree models {a mathematical formula}m1 and {a mathematical formula}m2 for {a mathematical formula}S and then compare their BIC scores.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The model {a mathematical formula}m1 is the model with the highest BIC score among all LTMs with a single latent variable, and the model {a mathematical formula}m2 is the model with the highest BIC score among all LTMs with two latent variables.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">5(b) shows what the two models might look like when {a mathematical formula}S consists of four word variables nasa, space, shuttle and mission.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We conclude that {a mathematical formula}S is uni-dimensional if the following inequality holds:{a mathematical formula} where Î” is a user-specified threshold.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In other words, {a mathematical formula}S is considered uni-dimensional if the best two-latent variable model is not significantly better than the best one-latent variable model.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let W be the variable in {a mathematical formula}S that has the highest MI with the variable X to be added to the island.</a>
