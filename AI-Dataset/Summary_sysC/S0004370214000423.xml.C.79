<a href="#0" id="0">Nonetheless, current exact approaches relying on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) fail to solve large scale instances [36], [43].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As tasks are fixed in time, finding all maximal sets of overlapping tasks, referred to as {a mathematical formula}C is polynomial [29].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The filtering algorithm proposed in [7] stems from the search of a maximum independent set in {a mathematical formula}GI(X).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We assume that the intersection, as well as the union, of two variable domains can be computed in {a mathematical formula}O(log(l)) worst case time with bit vector operations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Overall, the greedy propagator of AtMostNValue takes a graph G as input, calls a function F to compute independent sets in G and then filters variable domains with a set of rules {a mathematical formula}R. Therefore, we introduce the notation {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 G|F|R 〉 to define such a family of propagators.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note also that, as long as domain union and intersection operations are defined, no assumption is made about the kind of variables in {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In [21], we employed a two-step search strategy that first finds a subset of z allowed values and then assign a value to every decision variable {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In other words, if {a mathematical formula}z ⁎ denotes the optimum value, then the problem admits a solution for numerous value subsets of size {a mathematical formula}z ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In case no solution exists, a backtrack fixes it to 0 and turns the constraint into its opposite i.e., {a mathematical formula}maximum(X) ≠ z, so that the approach remains exact.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Basically, using {a mathematical formula}GCI instead of {a mathematical formula}GI aims at reducing the number of edges to obtain larger independent sets, hence a better filtering.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Instead, {a mathematical formula}R3 has a strong impact on Data_137: It enables to solve 26 more instances within the time limit.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This enables to measure the filtering ability stemming from {a mathematical formula}R4, which only makes sense if maximal AllDifferent constraints are not in the original model.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">First, the good propagation of AllDifferent constraints only makes a difference once the AMNV filtering is strong enough, i.e., when {a mathematical formula}k>0.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For that, we evaluate the relative gap {a mathematical formula}(z¯ – z ̲ )/z¯ depending on the running model.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">It shows that MIP model fails to solve about half of instances on both data sets: It is not able to provide either lower bounds or upper bounds ({a mathematical formula}100% gap).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">To evaluate the capacity of {a mathematical formula} ↑ AMNV 〈 GCI|MD,Rk|R1,3 〉 to provide quickly a good value of {a mathematical formula}z ̲ , we compare {a mathematical formula}z ̲ r and its required runtime with those of the lower bounding procedure given in [36].</a>
