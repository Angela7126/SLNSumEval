<a href="#0" id="0">Given a program P and a set {a mathematical formula}X → of program variables including all variables used in P, we define inductively the set of axioms for P and {a mathematical formula}X → , written {a mathematical formula} Π PX → , as follows:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let{a mathematical formula}Y → be a tuple of program variables that are not in P and not used in{a mathematical formula} Π PX → .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then considering only{a mathematical formula}X → ∪ Y → ,{a mathematical formula} Π PX → ∪ Y → is equivalent to the union of{a mathematical formula} Π PX → and the set of following “ frame axioms ” :{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider the following program P and two program variables {a mathematical formula}X1 and {a mathematical formula}X2 (notice that {a mathematical formula}X1 is used in P, but {a mathematical formula}X2 is not):</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The program variables are {a mathematical formula}A,B,Q,R,X,Y, where X and Y are inputs, and Q is the output.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let {a mathematical formula}X → =(A,B,Q,R,X,Y).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given a program P and a set {a mathematical formula}X → of program variables including all variables used in P, we again use {a mathematical formula} Π PX → to denote the set of axioms for P and {a mathematical formula}X → :</a>
