<a href="#0" id="0">It can be seen that stable semantics yields two extensions {a mathematical formula}{a,d} and {a mathematical formula}{b,c} for {a mathematical formula}F2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since c and d do not occur together in an extension there is an implicit conflict and thus {a mathematical formula}F2 is not analytic (for stable semantics).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the naive extensions of {a mathematical formula}F2 are given by {a mathematical formula}{a,d}, {a mathematical formula}{b,c}, {a mathematical formula}{c,d}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus c and d are not in an implicit conflict here, and the af is easily seen to be analytic for naive semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">in order to fulfill revision postulates) to have exactly the extension-set {a mathematical formula}S from above under stable semantics while consisting solely of the arguments {a mathematical formula}{a,b,c,a ′ ,b ′ ,c ′ }.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In words, {a mathematical formula}ArgsS stands for all arguments occurring in some element of {a mathematical formula}S and {a mathematical formula}PairsS for all pairs of arguments occurring together in some element of {a mathematical formula}S. As is easily observed, for all semantics Σ , {a mathematical formula} Σ (F) is an extension-set for any afF.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We have that {a mathematical formula}a ′ , {a mathematical formula}b ′ and {a mathematical formula}f ′ are self-attacking, since all semantics considered build upon conflict-freeness these three arguments can thus not be included in any extension.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Later, for semantics Σ , we will also need upper bounds for the problem {a mathematical formula}Cred Σ 2 defined as follows: given afF and arguments a and b, does there exist an extension {a mathematical formula}S ∈ Σ (F) such that {a mathematical formula}{a,b} ⊆ S (see e.g.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">no self-attacking arguments) af is contained in {a mathematical formula}CAFstb, as already observed in [14, Proposition 6], and therefore also in each {a mathematical formula}CAF Σ for all semantics Σ under consideration.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This immediately means that for stage semantics there is an implicit conflict between {a mathematical formula}x¯ and {a mathematical formula}FC (argument a to be precise).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This also means that for semi-stable semantics there are no implicit conflicts between {a mathematical formula}x¯ and any argument from {a mathematical formula}FC.It remains to show that F indeed is analytic for semi-stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Although the splitting theorem in [6] is not stated in terms of Definition 5 it immediately gives a function {a mathematical formula}GF Σ with the desired properties.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">An extension-set {a mathematical formula}S is called analytically realizable under semantics Σ if there is some analytic af{a mathematical formula}F ∈ XAF Σ with {a mathematical formula} Σ (F)=S.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The analytic signature (x-signature){a mathematical formula} Σ Σ x of semantics Σ consists of all extension-sets that are analytically realizable under Σ :{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">First of all note that every extension-set in the analytic signature of a semantics is also in the signature, i.e., {a mathematical formula} Σ Σ x ⊆ Σ Σ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In the following we will, for each semantics under consideration, either show that the relation is strict in the sense that certain extension-sets in {a mathematical formula} Σ Σ are not analytically realizable or show that also {a mathematical formula} Σ Σ x ⊇ Σ Σ holds, meaning that {a mathematical formula} Σ Σ x and {a mathematical formula} Σ Σ coincide.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">First we consider the relation between the signature {a mathematical formula} Σ nai and the analytic signature {a mathematical formula} Σ naix of naive semantics and formalize what we have already discussed in the introduction.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Let {a mathematical formula}S ′ ∈ stb(F) and assume that {a mathematical formula}b ∈ S ′ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">(4) For the last part of the theorem recall that the exact translation for {a mathematical formula}sem → prf from [25] does not add any implicit conflicts between arguments from the original af.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">This construction is justified by the fact that for any simple graph G, {a mathematical formula}|MIS(G)|=|nai(dir(G))| and furthermore, as shown in [14, Propositions 4 and 5] naive and stable semantics coincide on the class of irreflexive and symmetric afs.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Furthermore, we have already shown that first, {a mathematical formula} Σ maxcon(n) does not exceed the claimed value range in case of naive semantics and second, {a mathematical formula} Σ maxcon(n) is at least as great as the claimed value range in case of stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Recall that for a single connected component with n arguments the maximal number of Σ -extensions is denoted by {a mathematical formula} Σ maxcon(n) and its values are given by Theorem 41.</a>
