<a href="#0" id="0">The first problem can be resolved using taxonomy-based methods, which use a taxonomy of items and measure the similarity of users based on the users ʼ ratings of items and the classes that include them.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, they can measure the similarity of users accurately, even when there are sparse item transactions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, the previous method based on a single taxonomy could not resolve the problem of the sparsity of items and that of SAs simultaneously, while still maintaining the semantic relationships expressed by the linked information of a tag assigned to an item by a user.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is because the taxonomies of items and SAs are based on different types of item classifications.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Using a taxonomy of items, these methods measure the similarity of users based on class information.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, these methods can accurately predict user interests, even if the ratings dataset is sparse.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We confirmed the effectiveness of linking separate taxonomies of SAs and items by comparing the results obtained using linked taxonomies with those using a previous method [7] with a single taxonomy that merged subjective and item taxonomies in a naive manner.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">They construct taxonomies of mood words, which they to items.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, users can search for items that suit their “ mood ” at by selecting a mood word from the taxonomy.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The SAs considered in our study include user tags or comments related to the affect of users with respect to specific items, as explained in Section 2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The approach described above measures the similarity of users based on linked taxonomies rather than a single taxonomy of items, which is the case in previous taxonomy-based method [7], [24].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Thus, our method overcomes the sparsity problem, that occurs when applying SAs in CF, by utilizing the SAs/SCs assigned by users to items and their item classes.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Linked Taxonomies was also more accurate than the methods of Nakatsuji and Ziegler because they assessed user interests based only a single taxonomy.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Thus, they simply reflect the user ratings of items in their classes and they do not utilize the SAs users give to items.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Linked Taxonomies assesses user interests in more detail by linking taxonomies of items and SAs, which generates much more accurate recommendations.</a>
