<a href="#0" id="0">Abstraction [12]Let Π be a planning task with state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Π =(S,L,T,s0,S ⋆ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An abstraction of Θ is a surjective function {a mathematical formula} Α :S → S Α mapping {a mathematical formula}S to a set of abstract states, {a mathematical formula}S Α .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Abstraction heuristic [12]Let Α be an abstraction with an associated abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The induced abstraction heuristic{a mathematical formula}h Α (s) is a heuristic function that returns the cost of the cheapest path from {a mathematical formula} Α (s) to {a mathematical formula}S ⋆ Α in {a mathematical formula} Θ Α .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Each table represents an intermediate abstraction with relevant variables {a mathematical formula}W ⊆ V.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These tables recursively define the mapping between states in {a mathematical formula} Θ W to abstract states.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Each abstract state is identified with a number, from 0 to {a mathematical formula}| Α | − 1, where {a mathematical formula}| Α | is the number of abstract states in the abstraction.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Perform a second backward search in the abstract state space seeded with abstract states corresponding to states in the perimeter {a mathematical formula}{ Α (p):p ∈ P} with initial cost r. As noted by Felner and Ofek seeding the abstract search with cost r is equivalent to adding r to each heuristic value.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This means that the heuristic value of a state is an admissible estimate to the closest state in the perimeter plus the perimeter radius.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">After constructing a perimeter around the goal, the search frontier is relaxed into an abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Α 1.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Abstract searches are used to explore the state space outside the perimeter.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However, the abstraction will typically consider states in the perimeter equivalent to other states, so the information is not perfect anymore.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The algorithm does not only build a single perimeter; whenever the abstract search in {a mathematical formula} Α i becomes intractable, it is relaxed into a coarser abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Α i+1.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In the end, all the abstract perimeters are used as heuristics, to estimate the cost from states in the forward search to the perimeter.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The algorithm initializes the first search in {a mathematical formula} Θ Α 0 with the set of goal states.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Then, each phase i consists of a backward uniform-cost search in the abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α i initialized with the perimeter frontier of search {a mathematical formula}i − 1.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">During the search, the perimeter abstraction heuristic, {a mathematical formula}hPA, combines the estimate of each search, {a mathematical formula}hUCSi.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">If the initial perimeter search, {a mathematical formula}UCS0, has only expanded G, then C is the only node in open and the heuristic values of {a mathematical formula}hUCS0 are 0 for G, 1 for C, and 2 for the all other states.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">However, as C and D are mapped to the same abstract state, {a mathematical formula}hUCS1(D)=1<hUCS0(D).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Algorithm 3 can be adapted to compute the ADD representation of the M&S abstraction function (that maps states in S to abstract states in {a mathematical formula}Sn Α ) by assigning to terminal nodes the id of each abstract state instead of their heuristic value.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This is possible since the set of abstract states may be interpreted as a set of non-abstracted states.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Of course, the result of the image operation is a set of states of the original state space.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Fortunately, we can apply the abstraction function to obtain the set of abstract states associated with them.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The image and pre-image operations are applied as {a mathematical formula}image(S Α SM&S i,T Α SM&S i)= Α SM&S i(image(S Α SM&S i,T)).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">This perimeter corresponds to a regression search in the original state space, so that no abstraction is used to relax the search yet.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">The first BDD with {a mathematical formula}g=0 contains the goal states and by successive {a mathematical formula}pre-image operations SPA performs a standard symbolic regression search.</a>
