<a href="#0" id="0">A red – black finite-domain representation ({a mathematical formula}RB) planning task is given by a quintuple {a mathematical formula} Π = 〈 VB,VR,A,I,G 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}VB and {a mathematical formula}VR are sets of finite-domain state variables, called black variables and red variables, respectively, and A, I, and G are exactly as in {a mathematical formula}FDR and {a mathematical formula}MFDR tasks, specified with respect to the union of the black and red variables.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The semantics of {a mathematical formula}RB is as follows:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Applying an action a in state s changes the value of each black variable {a mathematical formula}v ∈ VB(eff(a)) to {a mathematical formula}{eff(a)[v]}, and changes the value of each red variable {a mathematical formula}v ∈ VR(eff(a)) to {a mathematical formula}s[v] ∪ eff(a)[v].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As pointed out, it is an open question whether plan generation for reversible {a mathematical formula}RB with acyclic black causal graphs is tractable, and we conjecture that it is not.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To understand this pessimism, recall that the overall causal graph – over black and red variables – may contain cycles (e.g., Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Any RSE-invertible {a mathematical formula}RB task with acyclic black causal graph is reversible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Any RSE-invertible {a mathematical formula}RB task with acyclic black causal graph is solvable if and only if its monotonic relaxation is.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Whenever the black precondition of the next action (or, at the end, the goal) is not satisfied, we project the planning task onto the black variables, and then project these variables' domains onto the values already visited along our red – black plan prefix.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We then solve this projected task to move the black variables into place.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The projected tasks have black variables only, so are in {a mathematical formula}FDR.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Their causal graph is acyclic because the black causal graph of the original task Π is.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">returning {a mathematical formula}hrepairRB(s):= ∞ if no relaxed plan exists and hence (by Corollary 1) no red – black plan exists either,</a>

<a href="#13" id="13">Therefore, to appropriately extend the algorithm as depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">7, there is no need to consider the red – black planning tasks {a mathematical formula} Π B as defined in Fig.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The main choice points are (i) selecting actions {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A0 in the while loop (pertains to red facts following), and (ii) selecting DTG paths for black variables in the solution to {a mathematical formula} Π B, i.e., inside {a mathematical formula}Achieve(g) (pertains to both, red facts following and relaxed plan repair).</a>
