<a href="#0" id="0">A Learning from Answer Sets task is a tuple {a mathematical formula}T= 〈 B,SM, 〈 E+,E − 〉 〉 where B is an ASP program called the background knowledge, {a mathematical formula}SM is the hypothesis space and {a mathematical formula}E+ and {a mathematical formula}E − are sets of partial interpretations called, respectively, the positive and negative examples.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, we could not give any examples about the value predicate – for each atom {a mathematical formula}value(x,y) (where x and y range from 1 to 4), there is at least one answer set of {a mathematical formula}B ∪ H that contains {a mathematical formula}value(x,y) and at least one that does not; this means that if {a mathematical formula}value(x,y) is given as either a positive or negative example, H will not be a solution of the task.This means that for any {a mathematical formula}ILPc task {a mathematical formula}Tc such that H is a solution, any subset of the hypothesis space {a mathematical formula}SM is also a solution of {a mathematical formula}Tc.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A Context-dependent Learning from Ordered Answer Sets ({a mathematical formula}ILPLOAScontext) task is a tuple {a mathematical formula}T= 〈 B,SM, 〈 E+,E − ,Ob,Oc 〉 〉 where B is an ASP program called the background knowledge, {a mathematical formula}SM is the set of rules allowed in the hypotheses (the hypothesis space), {a mathematical formula}E+ and {a mathematical formula}E − are finite sets of CDPIs called, respectively, positive and negative examples, and {a mathematical formula}Ob and {a mathematical formula}Oc are finite sets of CDOEs over {a mathematical formula}E+ called, respectively, brave and cautious context-dependent orderings.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}ILPLOAS can distinguish any two hypotheses that, when combined with a fixed background knowledge, behave differently.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It cannot distinguish hypotheses that are different but behave the same with respect to the background knowledge.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This means that there are some hypotheses that are not strongly equivalent (when combined with the background knowledge), but {a mathematical formula}ILPLOAS cannot distinguish one from the other.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consider a new learning framework {a mathematical formula}ILPd that takes as examples a pair of sets of atoms {a mathematical formula}E+ and {a mathematical formula}E − such that a hypothesis H is an inductive solution of a task if {a mathematical formula}B ∪ H has exactly one answer set and this answer set contains all of the {a mathematical formula}E+'s and none of the {a mathematical formula}E − 's.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For instance, in the case of one-to-one-distinguishability we could define the “ noisy ” one-to-one-distinguishability class of a learning framework as the set of tuples {a mathematical formula} 〈 B,H1,H2 〉 , for which there is a set of examples E such that {a mathematical formula}p(H1,E)<p(H2,E), where {a mathematical formula}p(H,E) is the total penalty paid by a hypothesis H (together with the background knowledge B) over the examples E. In fact, we now show that this extended notion of one-to-one-distinguishability class would be equivalent to the standard “ non-noisy ” one-to-one-distinguishability class.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider the programs {a mathematical formula}P1 and {a mathematical formula}P2.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula} For both programs {a mathematical formula}P1 and {a mathematical formula}P2, the immediate consequences of any interpretation I is the set {a mathematical formula}{p}.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This means that no example could possibly distinguish {a mathematical formula}P1 from {a mathematical formula}P2 with respect to an empty background knowledge.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Under the answer set semantics, however, {a mathematical formula}P1 has one answer set {a mathematical formula}{p}, but {a mathematical formula}P2 has no answer sets.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}ILPLAS can therefore distinguish {a mathematical formula}P1 from {a mathematical formula}P2 (with respect to the empty background knowledge), with the positive example {a mathematical formula} 〈 {p}, ∅ 〉 .</a>
