<a href="#0" id="0">One track for Sequential Portfolio Solvers: A portfolio solver is a solver that combines different (sequential) SAT algorithms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It may have, e.g., run multiple solvers in a time-slicing manner on a given SAT instance, or selected one solver out of a set of given ones (e.g., determined by a machine-learning approach based on some metric) to tackle the problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this track, one third of the benchmarks was selected from the application, one third from the hard combinatorial, and one third from the random category.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Within each category (except Random SAT), a mixture of satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances was used.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This section provides the solver rankings of SAT Challenge 2012, highlighting the best-performing solvers that were awarded, as well as a discussion of the detailed results of each track.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We ran the two best performing SLS solvers Sparrow2011 and sattime2011 from the 2011 SAT Competition on a set of 19 randomly generated k â€“ SAT instances for {a mathematical formula}k=3,5,7, executing each solver four times on the same instance using different seeds.</a>
