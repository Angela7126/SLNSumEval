<a href="#2" id="2">A credibility base of an agent {a mathematical formula}A ∈ A is a finite set {a mathematical formula}CA of credibility objects.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, the function Cl defined below, characterizes the agent's strict partial order as the transitive closure of the set of credibility tuples that are contained in the credibility objects of {a mathematical formula}C.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let us consider a pair of informants A and B, and a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C such that {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ Cl(C), and recall our assumption that each agent has a sound credibility base (see Remark 1).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The main task of a contraction operator is to obtain a new credibility base {a mathematical formula}C ′ in which {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∉ Cl(C ′ ), losing as little information as possible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As we will show below, contraction does not mean simply removing from {a mathematical formula}C those credibility objects containing the credibility tuple {a mathematical formula}(A,B).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This postulate establishes that {a mathematical formula}[(A,B),D] is accepted in the expanded credibility base if there is no pair {a mathematical formula}(B,A) in {a mathematical formula}Cl(C).</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">Then, the credibility objects {a mathematical formula}[(D,H),L], {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),M], {a mathematical formula}[(H,G),M], {a mathematical formula}[(J,K),E], {a mathematical formula}[(K,L),G], {a mathematical formula}[(L,M),E] are safe with respect to contraction by {a mathematical formula}(D,E) in {a mathematical formula}C; whereas the credibility objects {a mathematical formula}[(D,F),J] and {a mathematical formula}[(G,E),K] are not safe with respect to contraction by {a mathematical formula}(D,E) in {a mathematical formula}C.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The CR-contraction operator that we will define below is based on the contraction of a credibility order by a credibility tuple {a mathematical formula}(A,B) proposed in [47].</a>

<a href="#19" id="19">That is, the result of revising a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C by a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[T,D] should be a new credibility base that contains {a mathematical formula}[T,D].</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Next, we will give a construction of the prioritized revision operator for credibility bases, called C-revision using reliability (or CR-revision for short), denoted “ {a mathematical formula} ⊛ Σ ↓ ” .</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Consider an agent that has a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, and that the agent receives the information {a mathematical formula}[(A,B),S], that is, A is less credible than B.</a>

<a href="#26" id="26">Given a tuple T and two informant agents D and E, if {a mathematical formula}[T,D] is accepted in the revised base whenever {a mathematical formula}[T,E] is accepted in the revised base, then {a mathematical formula}C ⊚ ⊚ [T,D] and {a mathematical formula}C ⊚ ⊚ [T,E] preserve the same credibility objects.</a>

<a href="#30" id="30">In [10], the order in which new information is obtained is not taken in consideration; but, in our approach the order in which beliefs are considered is important.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">On one hand, if the prioritized operator is used, then the newest information is always accepted.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">On the other hand, when the non-prioritized revision operator is used, if an agent receives a credibility tuple {a mathematical formula}(A,B) and later receives {a mathematical formula}(B,A) and both have the same reliability, then {a mathematical formula}(B,A) will be rejected.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">In [47], change operators (expansion, contraction, and prioritized revision) for a credibility order ({a mathematical formula}O) were proposed.</a>
