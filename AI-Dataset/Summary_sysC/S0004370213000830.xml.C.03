<a href="#0" id="0">In addition, another of our contributions is an evaluation of feature labeling algorithms under real-world conditions using feature labels harvested from actual end users in our user study.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our supervised and semi-supervised algorithms were among the best performers when compared to other feature labeling algorithms in the idealized setting and they are also robust to poor quality feature labels provided by ordinary end users in our study.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our algorithm was among the best performing feature labeling algorithms in the idealized setting and it was also robust to poor quality feature labels provided by ordinary end users in our study.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The semi-supervised setting for feature labeling incorporates knowledge from three sources: a small labeled training set, the feature labels provided by the end user and information from the implicit structure of the unlabeled data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We evaluate our semi-supervised algorithm using both oracle feature labels and end-user feature labels from the user study mentioned above.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our feature labeling algorithm is one of the best performing algorithms with oracle feature labels and the best performer with lower quality feature labels from end users.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Supervised feature labeling algorithms require only a training set of labeled instances.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A class-relevant feature is a feature that is labeled with the class label {a mathematical formula}yi of instance {a mathematical formula}xi as specified by the feature labels.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We refer to our semi-supervised algorithm which uses no feature labeling information as LWLR-SS and the one using feature labeling information as LWLR-SS-FL.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The LWLR-SS-FL algorithm incorporates feature labeling into LWLR-SS by using the following similarity measure:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The benefit of incorporating feature labeling can be expressed as the improvement in macro-F1 score over the feature labeling algorithm Ê¼ s baseline when ten oracle feature labels were added.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">feature labels on features created by participants were ignored).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Participants were able to provide useful feature labels in our experiments, as can be seen in Fig.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Our results showed that features provided by end users could improve the accuracy of feature labeling algorithms.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">8 and Table 4 depict the results of adding 10 oracle feature labels per class to the semi-supervised feature labeling algorithms.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As before, we would like to evaluate the semi-supervised feature labeling algorithms using feature labels provided by actual end users rather than using idealized feature labels generated by an oracle.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Much of the past work on semi-supervised feature labeling had evaluated algorithms against oracle feature labels.</a>
