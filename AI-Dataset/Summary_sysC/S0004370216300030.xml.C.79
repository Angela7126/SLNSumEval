<a href="#0" id="0">This was also suggested by Makinson and Gärdenfors [19], according to whom “ q follows non-monotonically from p ” means that q holds if an “ arbitrary but fixed background theory ” (p. 189) is revised by p. Denoting that theory by K, belief revision by ⁎ , and non-monotonic consequence by {a mathematical formula}| ∼ we obtain:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It should be noted that this criterion does not exclude the existence of some belief change outcome in which {a mathematical formula}p&¬q holds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There can be some sentence r, less plausible than p, such that {a mathematical formula}p&¬q holds in some or all of the r-satisfying belief change outcomes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In other words, if ⁎ is a transitively relational partial meet revision on the belief set K, then there is a centrolinear model {a mathematical formula} 〈 X, ≦ 〉 such that K is the ≦ -minimal element of {a mathematical formula}X and that ⁎ coincides with the belief revision derived from {a mathematical formula} 〈 X, ≦ 〉 according to the simple principle just referred to [14].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For the co-occurrence test we need to identify, for each sentence p, a set of reasonably plausible belief sets containing p. We can assume that this set satisfies the following continuity property: If Z is a reasonably plausible p-containing set, and Y is a p-containing set such that {a mathematical formula}Y ≦ Z, then Y is a reasonably plausible p-containing set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, we can assume that {a mathematical formula}K ⁎ p is the ≦ -minimal p-containing set and that it is reasonably plausible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{sup:6} It then remains to identify, for each p, the ≦ -outermost reasonably plausible p-containing set.</a>
