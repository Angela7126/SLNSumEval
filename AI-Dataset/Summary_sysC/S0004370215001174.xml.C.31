<a href="#0" id="0">Scientific competitions are becoming more common in many research areas of artificial intelligence and robotics, since they provide a shared testbed for comparing different solutions and enable the exchange of research results.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, they are interesting for general audiences and industries.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Currently, many major research areas in artificial intelligence and robotics are organizing multiple-year competitions that are typically associated with scientific conferences.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One important aspect of such competitions is that they are organized for many years.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This introduces a temporal evolution that is interesting to analyze.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, the problem of evaluating a competition over many years remains unaddressed.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We believe that this issue is critical to properly fuel changes over the years and measure the results of these decisions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, this article focuses on the analysis and the results of evolving competitions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this article, we present the RoboCup@Home competition, which is the largest worldwide competition for domestic service robots, and evaluate its progress over the past seven years.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We show how the definition of a proper scoring system allows for desired functionalities to be related to tasks and how the resulting analysis fuels subsequent changes to achieve general and robust solutions implemented by the teams.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Our results show not only the steadily increasing complexity of the tasks that RoboCup@Home robots can solve but also the increased performance for all of the functionalities addressed in the competition.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We believe that the methodology used in RoboCup@Home for evaluating competition advances and for stimulating changes can be applied and extended to other robotic competitions as well as to multi-year research projects involving Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this article, we are mainly interested in analyzing the results of competitions over the years.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In particular, we focus on how this analysis has been carried out in the last years within the RoboCup@Home competition, which is the largest competition for domestic and service robots.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The evaluation of a competition's effectiveness based on the scores of the teams over the years is important for better fueling the competition and the novel approach introduced in RoboCup@Home for addressing this issue is the main contribution of this article.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Although our analysis reported in this article is specific to the RoboCup@Home competition, we believe that its principles can be applied both to other existing competitions and to new ones, and it could even be used for evaluating multi-year projects or challenges in AI and robotics where some tasks are repeated and changed over the years.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Moreover, the RoCKIn project and the competition organized within it clearly relate competitions and benchmarking.</a>
