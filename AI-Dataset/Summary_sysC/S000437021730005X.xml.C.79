<a href="#0" id="0">Here we define a plan case by a triple, i.e., an initial state {a mathematical formula}s0, a goal g and an action sequence that transits {a mathematical formula}s0 to g. These cases can be seen as providing additional knowledge of the domain over and above the incomplete domain theory.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It begins with the step of collecting sets of predicates P, action schemas A and macro-operator schemas O from incomplete action models {a mathematical formula}A ˜ and plan cases {a mathematical formula}C. In the next two steps, it constructs sets of soft and hard constraints to ensure that the learned domain model can best explain the input plan cases and incomplete action models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is straightforward to construct the set of predicates P. We first collect all predicates {a mathematical formula}R ˜ used in the given incomplete action models {a mathematical formula}A ˜ , and view them as the initial set of predicates P. We then scan each proposition in plan cases and put its corresponding predicates (by replacing parameters of the proposition with variables) in P if it is not in P. Likewise, we build a set of action schemas A by scanning all the incomplete action models and plan cases.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The rationale behind this fact is that, since the model-based approach (i.e., RIM) solves the model-lite planning problems directly based on learnt action models (and macro-operators as well), the higher the quality of the input action models are (which largely influences the quality of the learnt action models), the better the accuracy of the model-based approach is.</a>
