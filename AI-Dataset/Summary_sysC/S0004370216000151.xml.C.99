<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula} Ξ ¯=( Ξ 1, … , Ξ k) be an arbitrary assignment.For each {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≤ k, consider {a mathematical formula} Ζ i to be either a bijective mapping from natural numbers to natural numbers, or a bijective mapping from global states to global states, or a bijective mapping from actions to actions, or a bijective mapping from {a mathematical formula}ACTL ⁎ K ∖ X formulae to {a mathematical formula}ACTL ⁎ K ∖ X formulae, the exact mapping depending on the context.In the first case, define {a mathematical formula} Ζ i:{1, … ,n¯(i)} → {1, … ,n¯(i)} to be an arbitrary mapping.For the second case, recall that for a global state g, {a mathematical formula}lsij(g) returns the concrete local state of agent {a mathematical formula}(i,j) in g, and {a mathematical formula}tlsij(g) returns the template local state of agent {a mathematical formula}(i,j) in g. Then define {a mathematical formula} Ζ i:G(n¯) → G(n¯) by {a mathematical formula} Ζ i(g)=g ′ iff {a mathematical formula}tlsij(g ′ )=tlsi Ζ i − 1(j)(g), for each {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ j ≤ n¯(i), and {a mathematical formula}lsE(g ′ )=lsE(g).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Intuitively, to calculate a cutoff, we require that each agent in the cutoff system, referred to by the atomic propositions and epistemic modalities in the trivial instantiation of an {a mathematical formula}m¯-indexed formula, is able to make any transition that the agent can make in any bigger system.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This will enable us to establish that the cutoff system {a mathematical formula}m¯-stuttering simulates every bigger system.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By Theorem 3.9 we can then conclude that if the cutoff system satisfies a formula then the formula is satisfied by every bigger system.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider an agent {a mathematical formula}(i,j) indexing an atomic proposition or an epistemic modality in the trivial instantiation of an {a mathematical formula}m¯-indexed formula and a transition by means of a multi-role action of agent {a mathematical formula}(i,j) that is guarded by agent {a mathematical formula}(r,q).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As discussed in Section 2.2, the enabling of the action depends on whether or not the action is enabled by the protocols at the current local states of the agents and the environment.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Firstly observe that by the definition of the PMCP and Theorem 3.9, it suffices to show that if {a mathematical formula}T ≤ aesE, then: (i) the cutoff system {a mathematical formula}S(c¯){a mathematical formula}m¯-stuttering simulates every bigger system; (ii) every bigger system {a mathematical formula}m¯-stuttering simulates {a mathematical formula}S(c¯).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As related states in each of the simulations need only to agree on the atomic propositions indexed by the agents in {a mathematical formula}A(m¯), we only have to simulate transitions taken by the agents in {a mathematical formula}A(m¯).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The first simulation requirement follows trivially by the definition of {a mathematical formula}R1 and by observing that each agent in {a mathematical formula}A(m¯) remains in its initial local state in {a mathematical formula}p.To show the simulation requirement (iii), let {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ Π (g).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To show the simulation requirements (i) and (iii), assume that {a mathematical formula}g ∼ m¯ssg ′ for an arbitrary pair of global states in {a mathematical formula}G(c¯)×G(n¯).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Choose an arbitrary {a mathematical formula}n¯ ≥ c¯.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We show that {a mathematical formula}S(n¯) ≤ m¯ssS(c¯).</a>
