<a href="#0" id="0">An {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ argumentation theory yields an argument, A, in two cases:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ argumentation theory thus yields a set of arguments and a set of attacks, which can be considered as an abstract argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}c,b: conjecture (c – current conjecture, b – new conjecture)</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}l,k: lemma (l – current lemma, k – new lemma)</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For Proponent's {a mathematical formula}Conjecture(c) and {a mathematical formula}Lemma(li) moves, all that needs to be done is to add c and the {a mathematical formula}li to the AIF graph.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The {a mathematical formula}ProofDone move is used to establish the inferential connection between them (in AIF terms, it adds an RA-node with incoming edges from each of the {a mathematical formula}li and an outgoing edge to the c).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">4 visualises the AIF structure available after proponent has offered a putative proof for a conjecture, c, based on lemmas {a mathematical formula}L1, {a mathematical formula}L2 and {a mathematical formula}L3.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Opponent's {a mathematical formula}GlobalCounter(m,c) performs a total of four updates to the AIF structure.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Opponent's {a mathematical formula}LocalCounter(m,l) simply introduces the counterexample, m and the symmetrical conflict (i.e.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Proponent's eight possible substantive responses (excluding {a mathematical formula}Surrender) to a counter then update the AIF graph further:</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{a mathematical formula}MonsterBar allows Proponent to challenge the counterexample offered by Opponent by changing the definition of terms upon which it depends.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The {a mathematical formula}MonsterBar move itself updates the AIF in two steps.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula}MonsterReject-ing allows Opponent the same freedom as Proponent in offering a reason for thinking the counterexample does, indeed hold.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This reason s is naturally in conflict with Proponent's reason that the counterexample does not hold, so the AIF updates are first to add s and to link it as a further premise in the argument from the example, m, to the counter-conjecture, not-c (that is, to connect s to the RA-node between m and not-c).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In the former case, there is no further AIF update because Opponent is simply reiterating Proponent's position.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In the latter case, Opponent can {a mathematical formula}MonsterReject, which has already been treated, above.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">{a mathematical formula}ODefinition allows Opponent to offer an alternative definition, which requires update to the AIF structure not only to include the new definition, e, but also (i) the conflict with Proponent's definition and (ii) the inference from e to Opponent's reason, s, for thinking the counterexample holds.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">For PiecemealExclusion(b), the revised conjecture, b is added to the AIF, and consequently {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {b}.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">In the {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ argumentation theory, {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}c ‾ ′ =c ‾ ∪ {r}.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The reason, r, is guaranteed to be in the grounded extension since there could be no attackers; as a result, the status of the abstract argument corresponding to the inference from counterexample, m, to counterconjecture, not-c, is guaranteed to be out (since it is attacked by the abstract argument corresponding to r).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">With this argument out, if there are no other pending counterexamples (and the dialogue protocol constrains the discussion to handle just one at a time), the conjecture will be in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Thus, MonsterBar(m, c, r) updates {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {(r, Α )} where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c].</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Thus, for MonsterAdjust(m, r), the associated update is {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {(r,m),(r, Α )}, where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c].</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The new lemma is introduced and added in to AIF and thence the {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ argumentation theory thus: {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {k}, {a mathematical formula}m ‾ ′ =m ‾ ∪ {k} and {a mathematical formula}k ‾ ′ =k ‾ ∪ {m}.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">At the abstract level, the argument corresponding to this lemma is guaranteed to be in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">That is, for GlobalLemmaInc(m, k), the update is {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {k} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {(k, Α ),(m,k),(k,m)}, where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c].</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">For GlobalCounter(m, c), we have that {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {m, Α } and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {( Ω , Α ),( Α , Ω )}, where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c] and Ω corresponds to the argument [{a mathematical formula}li so c] (i.e.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">that connects all of the lemmas {a mathematical formula}li to the conjecture, c).</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">The first five moves in the above dialogue transcript, (1-a) to (1-e), correspond to the introduction of the initial proof by Proponent.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Table 2 shows how the execution of these steps using the LG dialogue system (column 1 of the table) updates a shared theory, understood by the participants as the current state of the proof (according to the definitions in Section 3.2) (in column 2).</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">The AIF structures added by these moves are shown in column 3.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">{sup:16} The current {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ framework caused by mapping the complete new AIF structures according to [16] are shown in column 4.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">The abstract argumentation framework caused by inducing from the new {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ framework a new AF are shown in column 5, and finally the grounded extension computed over that AF is shown in the last column.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">This also adds C as an argument to the {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ framework, and to the abstract argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">This introduces three lemmas {a mathematical formula}L1, {a mathematical formula}L2, {a mathematical formula}L3 into dialogue theory, and three new nodes {a mathematical formula}I2, {a mathematical formula}I3, {a mathematical formula}I4 into AIF structure and argumentation framework in Fig.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Finally, in (1-e), the Proponent announces that they have completed constructing their proof, making the ProofDone move.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Performing ProofDone not only shows that the proof is complete allowing the Opponent to raise any challenges, but also creates a new rule of inference ({a mathematical formula}RA1) whereby representing that the given lemmas support the conjecture.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">This creates a new abstract argument, Ω , corresponding to the proof structure, and, as there are no attacks at this stage, Ω and the three given lemmas are all in the grounded extension (Fig.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">This is in conflict ({a mathematical formula}CA8 and {a mathematical formula}CA9) with the lemma, {a mathematical formula}L3, one of the premises of the abstract argument, Ω , representing the proposed proof, and hence Ω is no longer in the grounded extension (Fig.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Having introduced the revised lemma, K, the Proponent now performs the ProofDone move to incorporate this new lemma into the proof structure.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">The result of this move is to create a new rule of inference, {a mathematical formula}RA6, between the current lemmas ({a mathematical formula}L1, {a mathematical formula}L2, K) and the conjecture (C), this produces a new abstract argument {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ , which replaces Ω as the current proof (Fig.</a>
