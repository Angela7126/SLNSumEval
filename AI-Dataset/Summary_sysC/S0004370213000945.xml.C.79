<a href="#0" id="0">In that section, it is stated that in a situation “ where the evidence points precisely and unambiguously to a single non-empty subset A of Θ ” , “ we can say that the effect of the evidence is limited to providing a certain degree of support for A ” , denoted by {a mathematical formula}S(A) with {a mathematical formula}0 ⩽ S(A) ⩽ 1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Following these arguments, let w stand for the weight of a piece of evidence and {a mathematical formula}p( Θ ) for the degree of belief to which the evidence points to a single non-empty subset Θ of Θ , or the probability to which the proposition Θ can be proven when the evidence is gathered, we can have the following relationship among support function {a mathematical formula}S( Θ ), weight w and the degree of belief {a mathematical formula}p( Θ ){a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, Shafer ʼ s discounting method is defined to generate bpa for the evidence as follows{a mathematical formula}Shafer ʼ s discounting method changes the specificity of the original evidence in the sense that as long as {a mathematical formula}1 − Α >0, global ignorance is introduced to a belief distribution even when the evidence points to a proposition Θ precisely and unambiguously, or {a mathematical formula}p( Θ )=1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To illustrate the above arguments, suppose the following two pieces of evidence are given equal weight {a mathematical formula}w1=w2=1 − Γ with {a mathematical formula}0 ⩽ Γ ⩽ 1{a mathematical formula} where A, B and C are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive propositions, and Δ is a small positive real number with {a mathematical formula}0 ⩽ Δ ⩽ 1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is easy to show that for any {a mathematical formula} Γ >0 the result generated by combining (22) and (23) using Dempster ʼ s rule will always lead to similar imprecise results in the sense that the combined degree of belief in {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C} will always be positive.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Suppose{a mathematical formula}e(i)denotes the combination of the first i pieces of evidence and{a mathematical formula}m Θ ,e(i)is the probability mass to which Θ is supported jointly by{a mathematical formula}e(i), with{a mathematical formula}m Θ ,e(1)=m Θ ,1and{a mathematical formula}mP( Θ ),e(1)=mP( Θ ),1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Recursive ER rule with weightThe combined degree of belief to which L pieces of independent evidence{a mathematical formula}eiwith weights{a mathematical formula}wi{a mathematical formula}(i=1, … ,L), which are not necessarily normalised, jointly support proposition Θ is given by{a mathematical formula}with{a mathematical formula}m ˆ Θ ,e(L)given by Eqs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From Definition 4, a piece of evidence can be represented by{a mathematical formula} The above distribution is called Weighted Belief Distribution with Reliability (WBDR).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It is worth noting that in Definition 4 the original specificity of the belief distribution of {a mathematical formula}ei as represented by {a mathematical formula}p Θ ,i is strictly preserved because the following equation always holds{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">(48), {a mathematical formula}bi is referred to as a reliability perturbation coefficient, describing the level of the Decision Maker ʼ s (DM ʼ s) doubt over the reliability of the ith piece of evidence in light of its high conflict with other evidence and also the DM ʼ s attitudes towards individual and collective support.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">(50), the second formula is the application of Corollary 6, the third formula is the application of the ER rule given by Corollary 3 for a specific reliability perturbation function {a mathematical formula}ri( Σ ), and formula (4) is based on the above conjecture of the weighted average rule.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The definition of {a mathematical formula} Θ + means that it includes any proposition Θ with a positive degree of belief from any evidence plus any of its subsets B (or {a mathematical formula}B ∩ Θ =B).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Therefore, if {a mathematical formula}B ∉ Θ +, there will be no belief in B or any proposition D that includes B (or {a mathematical formula}D ∩ B=B), that is {a mathematical formula}pD,i=0 for any {a mathematical formula}D ⊆ Θ with {a mathematical formula}D ∩ B=B ∉ Θ + and all {a mathematical formula}i=1, … ,L.</a>
