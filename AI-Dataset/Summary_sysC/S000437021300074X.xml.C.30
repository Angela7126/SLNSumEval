<a href="#0" id="0">1, the values for the 5 authors of this count-of-count feature are shown on the right (an expression {a mathematical formula}k:l meaning that there are l papers with k citations).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is achieved by first defining directly on TET-feature values a discriminant function that turns a TET-feature into a predictive model (Section 3).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on this discriminant function a TET structure learning algorithm is developed that, strictly speaking, will discover a feature {a mathematical formula}(T,f) (T a TET, f a discriminant function defined on T), but from which in a trivial abstraction step we can extract the model-independent TET feature T (Section 5).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The following is a TET for a signature containing relations author, authorOf and cites:{a mathematical formula} According to the semantics given below, this TET represents a feature that is sufficient for computing the h-index of an author, for example.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A TET that will be sufficient for representing relevance features based on inverse-document frequency weights is{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A TET {a mathematical formula}T(V) with free variables {a mathematical formula}V=V1, … ,Vk will define a feature for k-tuples of domain entities: for any model {a mathematical formula}M, and any {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Mk the TET defines a feature value{a mathematical formula}V(T(a)).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">1 on the right shows (in a somewhat simplified form) the values {a mathematical formula}V(T(a1)), … ,V(T(a5)) for the TET {a mathematical formula}T(A) in (1).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We give the general definition of TET semantics in two steps: first we define the value space of nested counts associated with a given TET {a mathematical formula}T(V), and then the actual mapping {a mathematical formula}a ↦ V(T(a)).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the preceding example we have already introduced the values of the TET feature (1) for the entities {a mathematical formula}a1, … ,a5 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">1.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">These values refine the informal count-of-counts shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">1 by representing in a more principled way the recursive nature of count-of-counts, and by also including f counts (in this case, the number of papers not written by a given author, and the number of papers not citing a given paper).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In the following we give the general definition of the feature value {a mathematical formula}V(T(a)) ∈ V(T(V)) for a specific tuple a.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Consider the following weight assignment for the TET from Example 2.3:{a mathematical formula} We compute the discriminant function value for {a mathematical formula} Γ 2 and {a mathematical formula} Γ 3 from Example 2.6:{a mathematical formula} Since the underlying TET consists of a single branch, here {a mathematical formula}m=1 at all levels in the recursive value definition.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">At the first level of recursion we obtain:{a mathematical formula} To proceed, we compute for values of the form {a mathematical formula}(t,{f:k,t:l}) for the sub-TET {a mathematical formula}T ′ (A,P1) (cf.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">(5)):{a mathematical formula} Plugging this into (15) gives{a mathematical formula} The last re-arrangement of the terms in (16) can be read as follows: each paper {a mathematical formula}P1 written by author A contributes a factor 1.5 to the discriminant function value, and each citation to a paper by A contributes a factor of 2.0/1.5.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This consists of the definition of a metric on the value space {a mathematical formula}V(T) of a TET T.</a>
