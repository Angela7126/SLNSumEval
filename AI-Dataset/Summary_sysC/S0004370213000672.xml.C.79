<a href="#1" id="1">We show by induction that then {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β ),set( Γ )) ⊆ set( Α ).If {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Β ⋈ Σ Γ → Α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯1), then it is not hard to see from (40) that {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β ),set( Γ )) ⊆ set( Α ).If {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Β ⋈ Σ Γ → Α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯2), then there exist {a mathematical formula} Α ′ , {a mathematical formula} Β ′ , {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ such that {a mathematical formula} Α ′ ⊨ A Α , {a mathematical formula} Β ⊨ A Β ′ , {a mathematical formula} Γ ⊨ A Γ ′ , {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊆ Σ ′ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Β ′ ⋈ Σ ′ Γ ′ → Α ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By induction, we then have that {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ′ ¯(set( Β ′ ),set( Γ ′ )) ⊆ set( Α ′ ), while {a mathematical formula}set( Α ′ ) ⊆ set( Α ), {a mathematical formula}set( Β ) ⊆ set( Β ′ ) and {a mathematical formula}set( Γ ) ⊆ set( Γ ′ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By the fact that {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯ is clearly monotonic w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">set inclusion, it follows that {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β ),set( Γ )) ⊆ set( Α ).The case where {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Β ⋈ Σ Γ → Α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯3) immediately follows from the definition of {a mathematical formula}bet¯.If {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Β ⋈ Σ Γ → Α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯4), then there exist {a mathematical formula} Α 1, {a mathematical formula} Α 2, {a mathematical formula} Β 1 and {a mathematical formula} Β 2 such that {a mathematical formula} Α = Α 1 ∨ Α 2, {a mathematical formula} Β = Β 1 ∨ Β 2, and, by induction, {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β 1),set( Γ )) ⊆ set( Α 1) and {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β 2),set( Γ )) ⊆ set( Α 2).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have that {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β ),set( Γ ))=bet Σ ¯(set( Β 1 ∨ Β 2),set( Γ ))=bet Σ ¯(set( Β 1) ∪ set( Β 2),set( Γ )).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">From the definition of {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯ it easily follows that the latter expression is equal to {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β 1),set( Γ )) ∪ bet Σ ¯(set( Β 2),set( Γ )).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By the assumption, this latter expression is known to be included in {a mathematical formula}set( Α 1) ∨ set( Α 2), which is equal to {a mathematical formula}set( Α ).If {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Β ⋈ Σ Γ → Α was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet¯5), then there exist {a mathematical formula} Α 1, {a mathematical formula} Α 2, {a mathematical formula} Β 1, {a mathematical formula} Β 2, {a mathematical formula} Γ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Γ 2 such that {a mathematical formula} Α = Α 1 ∧ Α 2, {a mathematical formula} Β = Β 1 ∧ Β 2, {a mathematical formula} Γ = Γ 1 ∧ Γ 2 and, by induction, {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β 1),set( Γ 1)) ⊆ set( Α 1) and {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ¯(set( Β 2),set( Γ 2)) ⊆ set( Α 2).</a>
