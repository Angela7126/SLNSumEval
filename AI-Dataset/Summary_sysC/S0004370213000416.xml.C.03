<a href="#0" id="0">That is, the majority rule fails to lift the integrity constraint {a mathematical formula}T1 ∧ T2 → A from the individual to the collective level.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For instance, we have already seen that the majority rule is not collectively rational with respect to the integrity constraint {a mathematical formula}T1 ∧ T2 → A.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}F(B)j denote the result of the aggregation on issue j.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An integrity constraint is any formula {a mathematical formula}ic ∈ LPS.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Integrity constraints can be used to define what tuples in {a mathematical formula}D we consider rational choices.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We can model this situation with a set of three issues {a mathematical formula}I={U,S,C}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The set of issues is therefore {a mathematical formula}I={aa,bb,cc,ab,ba,bc,cb,ac,ca}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This rule, in case the number of individuals is odd, is the uniform quota rule with quota {a mathematical formula}q=n+12.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We call language any subset {a mathematical formula}L of {a mathematical formula}LPS.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In Section 2.3 we called an aggregation procedure collectively rational with respect to a formula {a mathematical formula}ic ∈ LPS if the outcome on every rational profile satisfies the same integrity constraint ic.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We now extend this definition to collectively rational procedures with respect to a given language {a mathematical formula}L:</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Given a language {a mathematical formula}L ⊆ LPS, call {a mathematical formula}CR[L] the class of aggregation procedures that lift all {a mathematical formula}ic ∈ L:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In particular, {a mathematical formula}F={F:DN → D|N is finite} is the class of all aggregation procedures for a given set of issues {a mathematical formula}I.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let {a mathematical formula}L be a language.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Another interesting fact is that procedures that are CR with respect to clauses (disjunctions of literals) are CR with respect to any integrity constraint in {a mathematical formula}LPS, i.e., {a mathematical formula}CR[clauses]=CR[LPS].</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We want to prove that there exists an aggregation procedure {a mathematical formula}F ∈ CR[L1] that is not CR with respect to Φ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Let {a mathematical formula}L1 and {a mathematical formula}L2 be languages for integrity constraints.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Given a class of aggregation procedures {a mathematical formula}G ⊆ F, call {a mathematical formula}LF[G] the set of integrity constraints that are lifted by all {a mathematical formula}F ∈ G:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">{a mathematical formula}LF[CR[L]]=L;</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">By Lemma 6, there exists a procedure F which is collectively rational for {a mathematical formula}L but not for Φ , in contradiction to our assumption that all procedures in {a mathematical formula}CR[L] are CR with respect to Φ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Let us therefore consider a class of procedures {a mathematical formula}G not containing any generalised dictatorship.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">{a mathematical formula}CR[literals]=Fliterals[U].</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">{a mathematical formula}CR[cubes]=Fcubes[U].</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">{a mathematical formula}CR[LXOR]=FLXOR[ND].</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">{a mathematical formula}CR[LPS]=GDIC.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Consider as integrity constraint ic the following formula: {a mathematical formula} ⋁ i ℓ ji.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Therefore, F is not collectively rational for ic and does not belong to the class {a mathematical formula}CR[LPS].</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">{a mathematical formula}CR[clauses]=GDIC.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Consider the case of two characterisation results {a mathematical formula}CR[L1]=FL1[AX1] and {a mathematical formula}CR[L2]=FL2[AX2].</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">{a mathematical formula}F[U]=CR[literals].</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">{a mathematical formula}F[ND]=CR[LXOR].</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Recall that {a mathematical formula}LF[G] is the set of integrity constraints lifted by all the aggregation procedures in {a mathematical formula}G, and let {a mathematical formula}L ⊤ , ⊥ be the language for integrity constraints generated by {a mathematical formula}{ ⊤ , ⊥ }.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">In case the number of individuals is odd, the majority rule has a unique definition by setting the quota to {a mathematical formula}q=n+12.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">The strict majority rule accept an issue if and only if a strict majority of the individuals accept it, i.e., it is the uniform quota rule with quota {a mathematical formula}q=n+22.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">In this section we make the assumption that the number of individuals is odd, and we indicate with Maj the uniform quota rule with quota {a mathematical formula}q=n+12.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">A paradoxical profile for the majority rule with respect to this integrity constraint features a first majority of individuals not satisfying literal {a mathematical formula} ℓ j, and a second majority of individuals not satisfying literal {a mathematical formula} ℓ k.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">{a mathematical formula}LF[Maj]=2-clauses.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">We can therefore assume that all quotas are {a mathematical formula}0<qj<n+1.</a>
