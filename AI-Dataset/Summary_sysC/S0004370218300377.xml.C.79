<a href="#0" id="0">Given {a mathematical formula}s ∈ SA, the transition function {a mathematical formula}s ′ = Ξ (s,A) is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} We say that A is executable if {a mathematical formula}SA ≠ ∅ or, equivalently, if{a mathematical formula} Sets of actions that are not executable do not play any role in our analysis as they will never appear in executable plans (see below for the exact definition).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that from the definition of transition function Ξ for single actions {a mathematical formula}sk=(s0 ∖ ⋃ j=1kEff Σ (j) − ) ∪ ⋃ j=1kEff Σ (j)+.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that the existence of an admissible partition of {a mathematical formula}FC implies that all the components in {a mathematical formula}C have the same number of fixed variables, which is also the number of the sets in the partition.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the special case in which the number of fixed variables in each component is equal to one, there is just one admissible (trivial) partition {a mathematical formula}FC={FC}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We now consider a grounding function gr for Α and an instance Γ for {a mathematical formula}T. If l is a formula in Α that matches {a mathematical formula}T via the component {a mathematical formula}c= 〈 r/k,p 〉 , depending on the structure of l, as illustrated in (18), we have that{a mathematical formula} Considering the definition of {a mathematical formula} Γ (T) in (3) and the fact that the quantified case above can only appear when {a mathematical formula}p<k, it follows that {a mathematical formula}gr(l) is either a subset of {a mathematical formula} Γ (T) or it must have empty intersection with {a mathematical formula} Γ (T).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Precisely, if {a mathematical formula}a=gr( Α ), it follows from the definition of {a mathematical formula}a Γ (see Remark 15) that:{a mathematical formula} Considering that, by Proposition 16, a is strongly Γ -safe if and only if {a mathematical formula}a Γ is also strongly Γ -safe, the property of strong safety of an action schema Α does not depend on the formulas in Α that do not match {a mathematical formula}T. Hence, in principle, such a property should be analysed by studying the restrictions of Α to the different {a mathematical formula}T-classes L of matching formulas.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Floortile domainConsider the template {a mathematical formula}Tft in Example 2 and the action schema {a mathematical formula} Α =paintUpst: {an inline-figure}, {an inline-figure}.Note that both formulas robotAt(r,x) and clear(y) in Α match {a mathematical formula}Tft and form two different {a mathematical formula}T-classes because they do not satisfy condition (ii) in Definition 59: {an inline-figure} and {an inline-figure}.Consider the instance {a mathematical formula} Γ 1 that associates tile1 to each fixed variable in the components of {a mathematical formula}Tft and grounding function {an inline-figure}, {an inline-figure} and {an inline-figure}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We can estimate this term with the product {a mathematical formula} Ω ⋅ |C| where Ω is the maximum number of formulas in any schema that shares the same relation and {a mathematical formula}|C| is the cardinality of the template's component set {a mathematical formula}C. We deduce that all safety checks for individual schemas (both the instantaneous and the durative ones) have a computational complexity of the order of {a mathematical formula}M ⋅ |A| ⋅ Ω ⋅ |C|, where M is the maximum number of formulas appearing in any schema and {a mathematical formula}|A| is the total number of schemas.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">TN-{a mathematical formula}SAS+ captures all the features of PDDL – Level 3 and represents planning tasks by using: i) a set of state variables, which are divided into logical and numeric state variables; ii) a set of axioms, which are used to represent logical dependencies and arithmetic sub-terms; and iii) a set of durative actions, which comprise: a) a duration variable; b) start, persistent and end conditions; and c) start and end effects.</a>
