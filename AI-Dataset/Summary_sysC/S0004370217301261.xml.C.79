<a href="#0" id="0">These new rational algorithms are based on rational metareasoning in the sense of [1], and use a myopic regret criterion to decide whether to compute {a mathematical formula}h2(n) or to bypass the computation of {a mathematical formula}h2 and expand n instead.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using exhaustive evaluations of all heuristics, even if {a mathematical formula}h1(n) already exceeded the threshold, can potentially help in propagating larger heuristic values to the neighborhood of n. Nevertheless, experiments showed that even in this context, lazy evaluation of heuristics is faster than exhaustive evaluation [10].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper we focus on just one decision type, made in the context of {a mathematical formula}LA ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}LIDA ⁎ — that of deciding whether to evaluate or to bypass the computation of {a mathematical formula}h2 for some node n. We have two options: (1) Evaluate the second heuristic {a mathematical formula}h2(n), and proceed using the value {a mathematical formula}fmax(n), or (2) bypass the computation of {a mathematical formula}h2(n) and use {a mathematical formula}f1(n), thereby saving time by not computing {a mathematical formula}h2, at the risk of additional expansions and evaluations of {a mathematical formula}h1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the context of {a mathematical formula}LIDA ⁎ , we must make this decision when we evaluate a node n and {a mathematical formula}f1(n) was within the current {a mathematical formula}IDA ⁎ threshold T (Line 13 in Algorithm 2).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, we define a criterion based on the regret for bypassing {a mathematical formula}h2(n) in this context.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We define regret here as the value lost (in terms of expected increased run time) due to bypassing the computation of {a mathematical formula}h2(n), i.e., how much runtime is increased due to bypassing the computation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We wish to compute {a mathematical formula}h2(n) only if this regret is positive.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Suppose that we choose to compute {a mathematical formula}h2 — this results in one of the following outcomes: {a mathematical formula}h2helpful:That is, the computation of {a mathematical formula}h2(n) will prevent the expansion of n. For {a mathematical formula}LA ⁎ , this means that n is re-inserted into Open, and the goal is found without ever expanding n, which is only possible if {a mathematical formula}fmax(n) ≥ C ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In order to derive a rational policy, we begin by analyzing our two possible decisions: to compute {a mathematical formula}h2 or to bypass {a mathematical formula}h2, under the two (unknown) possible future outcomes: {a mathematical formula}h2 is helpful or not.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Using Table 2, we can now derive a rational policy for deciding whether to compute or bypass {a mathematical formula}h2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In other words, knowing the future alone is insufficient if you do not use the information to reduce search time (rather than only to evaluate {a mathematical formula}h2 iff it is helpful), and this version of the clairvoyant algorithm fails to provide the needed yardstick.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Suppose further that we know the exact runtime {a mathematical formula}ti of each heuristic, and the probability {a mathematical formula}phi that it will be helpful, given the current state of the search (including, possibly, results obtained by previous evaluations of heuristics).</a>
