<a href="#0" id="0">The agent provides advice for the operator regarding which actions s/he should take and acts as a smart filter between the robots' requests and the human operator.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">[21] created RoboLeader, an agent that helps collaboration between a human operator and a team of robots in a simulated search environment.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Advice: A piece of advice is defined as a possible action {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A suggested by an automated agent for the human operator to perform.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The operator decides to change its battery (a), and therefore, for a time of {a mathematical formula}Co(s1,a), the operator is engaged in the task of changing the battery of the robot ({a mathematical formula}s ′ ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Namely, in order to learn {a mathematical formula}Rw( ⋅ ), we ran 150 h of sessions, each one lasting 12.5 min, in our warehouse simulation environment without a human operator present.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Training{a mathematical formula}Cw(s,a)and{a mathematical formula}Pw(s,a,s ′ ,C(s,a)): We define {a mathematical formula}Cw(s,a) as the expected time for completing a by the average human operator and {a mathematical formula}Pw(s,a,s ′ ,C(s,a)) as the probability of transitioning from s to {a mathematical formula}s ′ using advice a, given {a mathematical formula}C(s,a).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Training{a mathematical formula}Cs(s,a)and{a mathematical formula}Ps(s,a,s ′ ,C(s,a)): We define {a mathematical formula}Cs(s,a) as the expected time for completing a by an average human operator and {a mathematical formula}Ps(s,a,s ′ ,C(s,a)) as the probability for transitioning from s to {a mathematical formula}s ′ using advice a, given {a mathematical formula}Cs(s,a).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given state s, our naïve agent provided advice a which, upon completion, is expected to bring about a new state {a mathematical formula}s ′ , where {a mathematical formula}Rs(s ′ )+5s<Rs(s).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Similar to the naïve agent in the warehouse operation task (Section 4.1.1), the agent only offers advice which can be completed and only if the human operator is not currently engaged in the suggested task (for example, if a robot has malfunctioned the agent will not advise tele-operating it, but it might advise fixing the robot).</a>
