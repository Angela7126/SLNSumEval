<a href="#0" id="0">An argumentation framework (AF) is a pair {a mathematical formula}F=(A,R) where A is a set of arguments and {a mathematical formula}R ⊆ A×A is the attack relation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The pair {a mathematical formula}(a,b) ∈ R means that a attacks b.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We say that an argument {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A is defended (in F) by a set {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ A if, for each {a mathematical formula}b ∈ A such that {a mathematical formula}(b,a) ∈ R, there exists a {a mathematical formula}c ∈ S such that {a mathematical formula}(c,b) ∈ R.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">A semantics for argumentation frameworks is defined as a function Σ which assigns to each AF {a mathematical formula}F=(A,R) a set {a mathematical formula} Σ (F) ⊆ 2A of extensions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let {a mathematical formula}F=(A,R) be an AF.</a>

<a href="#18" id="18">The preferred labelings are those complete labelings where {a mathematical formula}Lin is ⊆ -maximal among all complete labelings.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We recall the most important reasoning problems for AFs: Given an argumentation framework F and a semantics Σ , {a mathematical formula}Enum Σ (F) results in an enumeration of all extensions.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">A simpler notion is {a mathematical formula}Count Σ (F), which only counts the number of extensions.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Query-based problems are {a mathematical formula}Cred Σ (a,F) and {a mathematical formula}Skept Σ (a,F) for deciding credulous (respectively skeptical) acceptance of an argument a.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The former returns yes if a is contained in at least one extension under Σ , while for the latter to return yes, a must be contained in all extensions under Σ .</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Finally, we also consider the problem {a mathematical formula}Ver Σ (S,F) of verifying a given extension, i.e., testing whether a given set S is a Σ -extension of F. This problem typically occurs as a subroutine of a reasoning procedure.</a>

<a href="#30" id="30">For preferred semantics, F has a single extension {a mathematical formula}Enumprf(F)={{a,d}}, {a mathematical formula}Countprf(F)=1, and thus credulous and skeptical acceptance coincide (e.g., {a mathematical formula}Credprf(a,F)=Skeptprf(a,F)=yes).</a>

<a href="#38" id="38">Formally, the correspondence between sets of extensions and models of a propositional formula can be defined as follows.</a>

<a href="#42" id="42">Given an AF {a mathematical formula}F=(A,R) the following formula can be used to solve the enumeration problem of admissible semantics.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">{a mathematical formula}</a>

<a href="#45" id="45">Note that for convenience, the conjuncts are arranged in a different order than in the definition of {a mathematical formula}admA,R.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">For an arbitrary AF {a mathematical formula}F=(A,R), its preferred extensions are in a 1-to-1 correspondence to the models of {a mathematical formula}prfA,R, i.e., {a mathematical formula}Enumprf(F) ≅ {M|M ⊨ prfA,R}.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">Then, similar as in {a mathematical formula}prfA,R, the preferred extensions or their labelings can be encoded with a QBF as follows, with the quantified atoms {a mathematical formula}Av ′ ={va ′ ⊕ ,va ′ ⊖ |a ′ ∈ A ′ }.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">Algorithm 1 decides skeptical acceptance under preferred semantics of an argument a in an AF F. The idea is to proceed from one preferred extension to the next and checking whether a is in one of the extensions.</a>

<a href="#52" id="52">PrefSat encodes labelings of an AF {a mathematical formula}F=(A,R) by generating three variables per argument, i.e., the set of variables in the constructed formula are {a mathematical formula}{Ia,Oa,Ua|a ∈ A}.</a>

<a href="#55" id="55">In order to decide {a mathematical formula}Cred Σ (a,F) one can conjoin the base formula with an atom corresponding to the acceptance of argument a.</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">Given an AF {a mathematical formula}F=(A,R), the associated CSP {a mathematical formula}(X,D,C) is specified as {a mathematical formula}X=A and for each {a mathematical formula}ai ∈ X, {a mathematical formula}Di={0,1}.</a>

<a href="#60" id="60">{a mathematical formula}|S|=|I|.</a>
<a href="#61" id="61">For any AF {a mathematical formula}F=(A,R), the admissible sets of F correspond to the answer sets of {a mathematical formula} Π adm augmented by {a mathematical formula}F ˆ , i.e.</a>
<a href="#62" id="62">{a mathematical formula}adm(F) ≅ AS( Π adm(F ˆ )).</a>

<a href="#64" id="64">{a mathematical formula}undefeated(a) is derived if argument a is not defeated in F by the second guess T.</a>
<a href="#65" id="65">With these predicates at hand, we can now formally define the module for preferred extensions,{a mathematical formula} Then, for any AF F, the answer sets of {a mathematical formula} Π prf(F ˆ ) are in a one-to-one correspondence with the preferred extensions of F, i.e.</a>
<a href="#66" id="66">{a mathematical formula}prf(F) ≅ AS( Π prf(F ˆ )).</a>
<a href="#67" id="67">This in turn gives us the subset-maximal admissible sets which captures the definition of preferred semantics.</a>
<a href="#68" id="68">{a mathematical formula} As a result we get that for any AF F, the answer sets of {a mathematical formula} Π prf_metasp(F ˆ ) are in a one-to-one correspondence with the preferred extensions of F, i.e.</a>
<a href="#69" id="69">{a mathematical formula}prf(F) ≅ AS( Π prf_metasp(F ˆ )).</a>
<a href="#70" id="70">As with other reduction-based approaches, the types of reasoning available depend on the ASP solver.</a>
<a href="#71" id="71">Many of them feature enumeration of all solutions, as well as counting and also credulous and skeptical reasoning.</a>
<a href="#72" id="72">For the metasp variant, the meta encodings can be augmented with constraints to achieve credulous and skeptical reasoning.</a>
<a href="#73" id="73">Usually, when one uses an ASP program, like {a mathematical formula} Π prf for preferred semantics, for an AF F, the ASP solver returns all answer sets of the program which correspond to all preferred extensions of F. For credulous or skeptical acceptance, one uses the respective reasoning problems of the ASP solver, which are sometimes referred to as brave or cautious reasoning.</a>
<a href="#74" id="74">Note that the concrete usage depends on the particular solver.</a>
<a href="#75" id="75">To compute all arguments which are skeptically accepted under preferred semantics for a given AF F, we invoke{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#76" id="76">Instead, it exploits the observation that a complete labeling {a mathematical formula}L is a preferred labeling iff there is no subset S of {a mathematical formula}Lundec such that the set {a mathematical formula}Lin ∪ S is admissible.</a>
<a href="#77" id="77">In particular, for candidate labelings where all arguments are labeled either in or out, this avoids an explicit check of maximality (such labelings correspond to stable extensions).</a>
<a href="#78" id="78">Secondly, in [36] the authors provide a smart traversal of the search space such that one can avoid deleting sets from {a mathematical formula}SL, i.e., in each step one can decide whether the current candidate is preferred or not, by only using previously computed preferred labelings (see Algorithm 4).</a>
<a href="#79" id="79">This algorithm iterates over all admissible sets and tests whether they are ⊆ -maximal.</a>
<a href="#80" id="80">As for each argument a the algorithm first tries to add an argument to {a mathematical formula}Lin before considering the variant without a, we can be sure that supersets are always considered first.</a>
<a href="#81" id="81">Hence, we never have to remove a labeling from the set {a mathematical formula}SL.</a>
<a href="#82" id="82">The pitfall of Algorithm 4 is the potential exponential number of admissible labelings (even for a small number of preferred extensions) which are all considered by the algorithm.</a>
<a href="#83" id="83">many branches producing the same extension.</a>
<a href="#84" id="84">For {a mathematical formula}F2 there is just one preferred extension but Algorithm 4 considers all {a mathematical formula}2|A| admissible sets.</a>
<a href="#85" id="85">In contrast, Algorithm 3 terminates immediately.</a>
<a href="#86" id="86">First, check whether the set {a mathematical formula}Lin is conflict-free and if so label all arguments attacking {a mathematical formula}Lin with out.</a>
<a href="#87" id="87">First, consider a game that provides, given an AF {a mathematical formula}F=(A,R) and argument {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A, a proof whether a is contained in the grounded extension of F. The game is given by the following rules of allowed moves of each player.</a>
<a href="#88" id="88">The grounded extension is {a mathematical formula}{a,d}.</a>
<a href="#89" id="89">Now let us consider a game that allows us, given an AF {a mathematical formula}F=(A,R) and argument {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A, to prove whether a is contained in some preferred extension of F (or equivalently in some admissible set).</a>
<a href="#90" id="90">Consider the very simple AF {a mathematical formula}F=({a,b},{(a,b),(b,a)}) with the admissible sets {}, {a mathematical formula}{a} and {a mathematical formula}{b}.</a>

<a href="#92" id="92">LEAF node: Here we have {a mathematical formula}Ft=F ≥ t and thus the restricted admissible sets are just the conflict-free sets.</a>
