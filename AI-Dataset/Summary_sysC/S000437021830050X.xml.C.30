<a href="#0" id="0">In the case of destructive control, the attacker's goal is to prevent Ω from winning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In constructive control, the attacker's goal is to make a candidate of their choice {a mathematical formula} Υ ∈ C{a mathematical formula}( Υ ≠ Ω ) win.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The defender's goal is to defend against each type of control, i.e., to ensure that the original winner still wins the election despite the control.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This can be achieved by solving another zero-sum game, which we term the Υ -{a mathematical formula}zero-sum game.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This game is identical to the Ω -zero-sum game except that the defender's goal is to minimize the probability that Υ wins.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The Stackelberg equilibrium of the Υ -zero-sum game (which is equivalent to its Nash equilibria) can be computed in the same way as for the Ω -zero-sum game.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}(x Υ ,a Υ ) be the equilibrium strategies for the defender and the attacker in the Υ -zero-sum game, and let {a mathematical formula}p0 Υ be the probability that Υ wins the game given {a mathematical formula}(x Υ ,a Υ ).</a>
