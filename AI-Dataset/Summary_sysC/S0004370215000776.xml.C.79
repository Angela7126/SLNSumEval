<a href="#0" id="0">An approximation operator {a mathematical formula}O ∈ I and {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Does there exist a Σ -model/pair {a mathematical formula}(X,Y) of {a mathematical formula}O such that {a mathematical formula}s ∈ X?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}Skept Σ I</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An approximation operator {a mathematical formula}O ∈ I and {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Does it hold that for all Σ -models/pairs {a mathematical formula}(X,Y) of {a mathematical formula}O we have {a mathematical formula}s ∈ X?</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">So in a sense the approximate operator cannot see beyond the case distinction {a mathematical formula}a ∨ ¬a.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}O, then there exists a {a mathematical formula}(X ′ ,Y ′ ) with {a mathematical formula}(X,Y) ≤ i(X ′ ,Y ′ ) which is preferred with respect to {a mathematical formula}O and where {a mathematical formula}s ∈ X ′ by Theorem 3.3.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus by the axiom of choice, there exists a function {a mathematical formula}f:D → D with{a mathematical formula} Clearly f is increasing, that is, for all {a mathematical formula}a¯ ∈ D we have {a mathematical formula}a¯ ≤ if(a¯).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By assumption,{a mathematical formula} Define {a mathematical formula}El=E ∩ Zu¯l and {a mathematical formula}Er=E ∩ Zu¯r.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We now show that this implies {a mathematical formula}s ∉ O ″ (X,Y).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since {a mathematical formula}s ∉ X (by assumption), for {a mathematical formula}X ⊭ Φ p to hold it must be the case that {a mathematical formula}-p ∈ X.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This is a contradiction, as shown above ({a mathematical formula}-p ∉ X).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Therefore {a mathematical formula}p ∉ (S ∖ Y) and it follows that {a mathematical formula}p ∈ (Y ∖ X).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">If {a mathematical formula}z ∈ O ″ ( ∅ ,P ∪ {z}), then by definition we can infer that there exists a Z such that {a mathematical formula} ∅ ⊆ Z ⊆ P ∪ {z} and {a mathematical formula}Z ⊨ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Then there exists a {a mathematical formula}P ′ ⊆ P such that for all {a mathematical formula}Q ′ ⊆ Q we have {a mathematical formula}P ′ ∪ Q ′ ⊨ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Now{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} For acceptance functions represented by propositional formulas, {a mathematical formula}Cs(X ∩ par(s))=t can be decided in polynomial time, since we only have to check whether {a mathematical formula}X ⊨ Φ s.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The proof makes use of this and employs two new statements y and z with acceptance formulas {a mathematical formula} Φ y=z → Ψ for a given QBF matrix Ψ and {a mathematical formula} Φ z=t.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For {a mathematical formula}DP-hardness, as for the approximate operator, consider the proof of Proposition 4.11.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">For {a mathematical formula}I=U, the proof is analogous to the one above – we show {a mathematical formula}NP-completeness of the complementary problem.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The complexity results we have obtained so far might lead the reader to ask why we bother with the approximate operator {a mathematical formula}G Ξ at all: the ultimate operator {a mathematical formula}U Ξ is at least as precise and for all admissibility-based and most conflict-free-based semantics considered up to now, it has the same computational costs.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">For guessing an interpretation for P, define the acceptance formulas {a mathematical formula} Φ p=¬-p and {a mathematical formula} Φ -p=¬p for {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P.</a>
