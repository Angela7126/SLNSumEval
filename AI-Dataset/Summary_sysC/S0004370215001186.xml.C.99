<a href="#0" id="0">This simplicity does not come by chance, rather, it is necessary and desired by the researchers: the problems to be approached are themselves so complex that whichever factors of complexity can be reduced (or at least postponed), the reduction is always welcome.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So, it is common practice that geographical space is reduced to a two-dimensional grid, and all social relations between agents are condensed into one more or less structured abstract relation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, each kind of social relation can possess distinctive characteristics that include: rich information such as degree of connectivity, centrality, trust, interactions frequency, asymmetry, and so on.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To explore the addition of multiple relations and its consequences for the dissemination of phenomena in social simulations, we put forward to reduce the emphasis given on agent individual interactions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We want to study the consequences of using multiple social networks at the same time while maintaining the interaction model as simple and abstract as possible (following the methodology in most opinion dynamics literature).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">One common issue of these models is the fact that once generated, the network structure is static.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">From the very beginning, our research questions were focused on the collective properties, the structure of the networks involved, and the dynamical outcomes of the simulations: thus leaving out issues related with individual motivations and desired results (either for any individual agent or the society).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">(Nevertheless, these models are designed to create networks with specific properties, not as general models for all kinds of real social networks)</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since we construct scenarios where we overlap highly clustered k-regular networks and scale-free networks with node hubs, we are interested in the kind of properties that emerge from merging these structures – and if/how they are comparable to the existing models – .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">10 shows the results for configurations with a number of networks ≥ 3 (since less networks lead to much worse results in terms of convergence speed).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">These plots reveal two types of situations: the typical runs, in which the number of encounters doesn't vary much, and some “ outlier runs, ” which present some interesting dynamics, as we will see later on.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In other words, different neighbourhoods in the network lead to different opinion observation configurations (possibly even creating self-reinforcing structures).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Thus, the influence of heterogeneous connectivity is reflected on the growth of opinion difference variance.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The difference between this model and the previous one is that the agents no longer interact in multiple networks at the same time (being able to select any neighbour at a given simulation step).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">With this new idea of swapping contexts, we covered some space left undeveloped in Antunes and colleagues original work [29], [30].</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For smaller values of k, symmetry in the context switching probability (having the same probability in both networks) is more important if the agent switches less from one of the networks.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">20 shows that for 2 networks the results in terms of number of encounters for the context switching approximate those for context permeability.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">When we increase the number of networks ({a mathematical formula}n ≥ 3), the configurations with higher switching probability lead the results to be closer to what happens in context permeability.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">It is still important that we get comparable results because we are introducing a temporal component that was never explored before in these types of opinion dynamics models: the fact that the agents can become active in different networks at different points in time.</a>
