<a href="#4" id="4">Steady setGiven a CNF theory Π and a model {a mathematical formula}M for Π , the minimal model {a mathematical formula}St ⊆ M of the theory {a mathematical formula} Π M ← nd is called the steady set of {a mathematical formula}M for Π .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Proof</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">First, notice that the models of the positive CNF theory Π which are contained in the model {a mathematical formula}M of Π coincide with the models of the positive CNF theory {a mathematical formula} Π M ← .Since {a mathematical formula} Π M ← nd is contained in {a mathematical formula} Π M ← , by monotonicity of propositional logic, it follows that all logical consequences of {a mathematical formula} Π M ← nd are also logical consequences of {a mathematical formula} Π M ← and, hence, each model of {a mathematical formula} Π M ← contains the unique minimal model of {a mathematical formula} Π M ← nd, which is the steady set of {a mathematical formula}M for Π .</a>
