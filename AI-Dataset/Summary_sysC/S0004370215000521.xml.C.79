<a href="#0" id="0">The equivalence of the first two follows immediately from Proposition 5.2 since {a mathematical formula}I[U:f]=I ∖ U=I ∩ U¯ and for every set X, {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ U¯ if and only if {a mathematical formula}X ∩ U= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The equivalence of the second and third follows from the fact that {a mathematical formula}I ∖ U=I ∩ U¯ and for all subsets {a mathematical formula}X,Y and Z of Σ it holds that {a mathematical formula}X ∩ Y ⊆ Y ∖ Z if and only if {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ ( Σ ∖ Z).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Having defined the truth value of a constraint atom {a mathematical formula}C(X) in an interpretation I, an immediate consequence operator can be defined in the standard way:{a mathematical formula} Grounded models of this operator still represent the same intuitions: an interpretation I is grounded if it admits no unfounded sets, or said differently, if it contains no atoms without external support.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For arbitrary formula Φ in {a mathematical formula}LK, Q a possible world structure and I an interpretation, we define that Φ is satisfied with respect to Q and I (denoted {a mathematical formula}Q,I ⊨ Φ ) by the standard recursive rules of propositional satisfaction, augmented with one additional rule:{a mathematical formula} For objective formulas Φ , it holds that {a mathematical formula}Q,I ⊨ Φ if and only if {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Viewed from this perspective, {a mathematical formula}T is the singleton set consisting of one inference rule:{a mathematical formula} Surely, such an inference rule should be of no value, as it can only derive something that has been derived before!</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The disadvantage of this notion, as recognised by Konolige, is that it is only defined for theories in a normal form where every sentence is of the form{a mathematical formula} where Α , Γ and the {a mathematical formula} Β i are objective.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For such pairs, the standard 3- and 4-valued Kleene truth valuation of propositional logic can be extended to a truth function {a mathematical formula} Φ (P,C),I by adding the following rules for modal formulas:</a>
