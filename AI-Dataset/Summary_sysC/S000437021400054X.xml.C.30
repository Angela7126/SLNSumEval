<a href="#2" id="2">I is {a mathematical formula}f Π I={r ∈ ground( Π )|I satisfies body(r)}, and I is an FLP answer set of Π if I is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}f Π I.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider the logic program {a mathematical formula} Π 2 in Example 2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By Definition 2, the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I={p( − 1),p(1)} is an FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 2, where {a mathematical formula}ground( Π 2)= Π 2 and {a mathematical formula}f Π 2I={r2,r3}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Summarizing, an interpretation I is an answer set of a normal logic program Π under the standard answer set semantics if {a mathematical formula}I=lfp(T Π I( ∅ )).</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">well-justified answer setLet I be a model of a logic program Π .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Then I is an answer set of Π if {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A for every {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">By Theorem 2, it is immediate that a model I of a logic program Π is an answer set of Π if and only if for each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I, {a mathematical formula}lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − )) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Every answer set I of a logic program Π is a minimal model of Π and furthermore, a minimal model of the FLP reduct{a mathematical formula}f Π I.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Note that for a model I of a normal logic program Π , {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) is a set of ground atoms; by Definition 9I is a well-justified FLP answer set of Π if and only if {a mathematical formula}I=lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Then, by Corollary 1 the well-justified FLP answer set semantics coincides with the standard answer set semantics and thus coincides with the FLP answer set semantics.</a>

<a href="#21" id="21">The same holds for well-justified FLP answer sets.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Consider the propositional logic program {a mathematical formula} Π ={p ← p ∨ ¬p}.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Since {a mathematical formula}p ∨ ¬p is a tautology in classical logic, {a mathematical formula}I={p} is both an FLP and a well-justified FLP answer set of Π .</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Then for each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I, {a mathematical formula}ground( Π ) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Since all rule bodies in Π are empty, {a mathematical formula}lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − ))=ground( Π ) and by Theorem 2, {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − ))=ground( Π ).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">This means that for each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I, {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">By Definition 9, I is a well-justified FLP answer set of Π .</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">This establishes the first equivalence.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">From this and since every well-justified FLP answer of an arbitrary logic program Π is an FLP answer of Π (Corollary 2) and every FLP answer set of Π as a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}f Π I also must be a minimal model of Π , the second equivalence follows.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Then, Π has no (resp.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">an) FLP or well-justified FLP answer set if and only if p belongs to every (resp.</a>
