<a href="#0" id="0">type distribution {a mathematical formula} ϒ : Θ + → [0,1], where {a mathematical formula} Θ + is a finite subset of Θ</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Definition 3</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A type distribution ϒ is called pure if {a mathematical formula} ∃ Θ ∈ Θ +: ϒ ( Θ )=1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A type distribution which is not pure is called mixed.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our definition of correctness is with respect to the type distribution ϒ : beliefs are said to be correct if they assign the same probabilities to true types as ϒ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This requires that the beliefs can point to the types in the support of the type distribution.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, the results in this section pertain to a situation in which the user knows that the true type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ must be a subset of the hypothesised type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Formally, we assume:</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Assumption 1</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula} ∀ j ≠ i: Θ j+ ⊆ Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Example 3</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Consider a SBG with two players.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Player 1 is controlled by HBA using a sum posterior while player 2 has two types, {a mathematical formula} Θ 2+={ Θ A, Θ AB}, which are assigned by a pure type distribution ϒ with {a mathematical formula} ϒ ( Θ A)=1.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The type {a mathematical formula} Θ A always chooses action A while {a mathematical formula} Θ AB chooses actions A and B with equal probability.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">While the product posterior converges to the correct probabilities ϒ , the sum posterior converges to probabilities {a mathematical formula} 〈 23,13 〉 , which is incorrect.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Definition 8</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The correlated posterior is defined as{a mathematical formula} where P specifies prior beliefs over {a mathematical formula} Θ − i ⁎ (analogous to {a mathematical formula}Pj) and Η is a normaliser.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We specified a total of 10 different methods to automatically compute prior beliefs {a mathematical formula}Pj for a given set of types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ :</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Uniform prior The uniform prior sets {a mathematical formula}Pj( Θ j ⁎ )=| Θ j ⁎ | − 1 for all {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">This is the baseline prior against which the other priors are compared.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Utility prior: {a mathematical formula} Ψ U( Θ j ⁎ )=Uit( Θ j ⁎ )</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Stackelberg prior: {a mathematical formula} Ψ S( Θ j ⁎ )=Ujt( Θ j ⁎ )</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Welfare prior: {a mathematical formula} Ψ W( Θ j ⁎ )=Uit( Θ j ⁎ )+Ujt( Θ j ⁎ )</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Fairness prior: {a mathematical formula} Ψ F( Θ j ⁎ )=Uit( Θ j ⁎ ) ⁎ Ujt( Θ j ⁎ )</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">In our analysis, we will sometimes assume that the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical:</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Definition 9</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are critical if there is a set {a mathematical formula}Sc ⊆ S ∖ S¯ which satisfies all of the following:</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">We can show that Property 1 holds if the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i with positive expected payoff in X.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">We can show that Property 2 holds if the type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i which lead to states into which X may get as well.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">We can show that Property 3 holds if the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i which X might have chosen as well.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">As noted in Section 6, it does not generally suffice to consider the correctness of individual types, since we plan our actions with respect to both types and our beliefs regarding the relative likelihood of types (cf.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">(3)).</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">In this regard, we note that any combination of beliefs Pr and types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ can be described as a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j ⁎ of the form{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">This combination is equivalent to sampling a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j ⁎ using probabilities {a mathematical formula}Pr( Θ j ⁎ |Ht), and then using {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ to choose actions {a mathematical formula}aj ∈ Aj via {a mathematical formula} Π j(Ht,aj, Θ j ⁎ )[68].</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Analogously, we may combine the true types {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ⊂ Θ j of player j, using the type distribution ϒ , into a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j+ such that{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Therefore, to simplify the notation in this section, we will generally assume a single hypothesised type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j and a single true type {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ∈ Θ j.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Note that this means that our method can be applied to the combination of beliefs and hypothesised types, as well as to individual types in {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
