<a href="#0" id="0">However condition 2 also implies that any interpretation that satisfies the Standard Names Assumption is a Herbrand interpretation for {a mathematical formula}L. As will be discussed below, this assumption will support the logic programming semantics that will be used for rules.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A direct semantics for {a mathematical formula}ALCIO can be defined as in Table 1, which describes an interpretation that satisfies the Standard Names Assumption Definition 3, for role and concept expressions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The following conditions define when a LP interpretation J satisfies various constructs of {a mathematical formula}L. For a given ground objective literal l, ground default literal {a mathematical formula} ∼ l, set of ground literals S, ground rule Π , and ground program {a mathematical formula}P:{a mathematical formula} We also say that J is a model of{a mathematical formula}P if {a mathematical formula}J ⊨ P and that {a mathematical formula}P is consistent if it has a model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}M ⊨ Φ ≡ K Φ , as is evident directly from Definition 8, Definition 9.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To this end we extend the function Κ (introduced in Definition 5 to translate an ontology to a first-order theory) to translate any MKNF knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K to an MKNF theory {a mathematical formula} Κ (K).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Definition 9, Definition 12 imply that an MKNF model {a mathematical formula}M of an MKNF knowledge base is an SNA interpretation over {a mathematical formula}L. However, {a mathematical formula}M also can be represented as a set of generalised atoms.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To explain this, let {a mathematical formula}M be an MKNF interpretation, S a set of ground K atoms, and define the subset of S induced by {a mathematical formula}M as the set {a mathematical formula}{K Ξ ∈ S|M ⊨ Ξ }.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Additionally, let J be a subset of {a mathematical formula}HA(ground(P)), and define the objective knowledge of J with respect to{a mathematical formula}ground(K),{a mathematical formula}OBO,J, as being a first-order theory defined as:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, due to Theorem 14, it can be represented even more simply as a subset of {a mathematical formula}HA(ground(P)) which, if {a mathematical formula}P is a logic program with no generalised atoms, is simply an LP-interpretation.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Winslett's operator for first-order theories [96] is defined just as its propositional counterpart, using equation (5), the difference is only that the strict preorders {a mathematical formula}<WI are defined on predicate symbols in {a mathematical formula}P (Section 2.1) and for all interpretations {a mathematical formula}I,J,K ∈ IL as follows.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As the set of K-atoms inferred from a positive MKNF knowledge base is anti-monotonic with respect to elements of {a mathematical formula}M, the {a mathematical formula}TP operator, which maps an MKNF interpretation {a mathematical formula}M to the K atoms that can be inferred under the MKNF semantics, will be anti-monotonic.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In order to make use of {a mathematical formula}TK, we construct its greatest fixed point on the lattice of MKNF interpretations, and show in Proposition 23, Proposition 26 that any MKNF model corresponds to this greatest fixed point.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We have seen in the previous section that MKNF models of an MKNF knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K can be characterised in terms of reducts and the consequence operator {a mathematical formula}TK, similar to stable models of a logic program.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The first issue is that by relying on the defined consequence relation, we can only approximate its formulation as follows:{a mathematical formula} In other words, instead of equivalence on the right-hand side of the postulate, we only have entailment.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A semantics{a mathematical formula}Sfor{a mathematical formula}(T,S) is given by a partial function {a mathematical formula} 〚 ⋅ 〛 S:T → 2S that assigns sets of acceptable belief states from {a mathematical formula}S to theories from {a mathematical formula}T.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For the rest of this section we assume that the logical formalism {a mathematical formula}(T,S) is fixed but the semantics {a mathematical formula}S is not.</a>

<a href="#17" id="17">Nevertheless, the specifics of these definitions are not required to define what it means for a semantics {a mathematical formula}S to satisfy the Abstract Splitting Set Property.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The Abstract Splitting Set Property requires that the models assigned to a theory {a mathematical formula}T correspond one to one with the solutions to {a mathematical formula}T w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Abstract splitting set propertyWe say that a semantics {a mathematical formula}S for {a mathematical formula}(T,S)satisfies the Abstract Splitting Set Property if for all theories {a mathematical formula}T ∈ T for which {a mathematical formula} 〚 T 〛 S is defined and every splitting set U for {a mathematical formula}T,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Abstract splitting sequence propertyWe say that a semantics {a mathematical formula}S for {a mathematical formula}(T,S)satisfies the Abstract Splitting Sequence Property if for all theories {a mathematical formula}T ∈ T for which {a mathematical formula} 〚 T 〛 S is defined and every splitting sequence {a mathematical formula}U= 〈 U Α 〉 Α < Μ for {a mathematical formula}T,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The semantic function {a mathematical formula} 〚 ⋅ 〛 S returns all MKNF models of the argument MKNF knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">A splitting set for an MKNF knowledge base is defined analogously to a splitting set for a logic program, with the additional constraint that each ontology axiom must either use only predicate symbols from the splitting set, or only predicate symbols outside the splitting set.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">In the following, given any MKNF formula, MKNF theory, ontology axiom, ontology, (generalised) literal, (MKNF) rule, (MKNF) program or MKNF knowledge base Δ , we denote by {a mathematical formula}pr( Δ ) the set of predicate symbols occurring in Δ .</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Given these definitions, the splitting properties for a rule update semantics {a mathematical formula}S are directly derived from the Abstract Splitting Properties of Section 4.1.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Splitting theorem for rule updatesThe{a mathematical formula}RD-semantics for rule updates satisfies the Abstract Splitting Set Property and the Abstract Splitting Sequence Property.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The {a mathematical formula}( ⋄ ,S)-dynamic MKNF models defined above depend on a particular splitting sequence and there is no guarantee that under a different splitting, the same models will be obtained.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Fact update:Finally, since DMKBs consisting of a sequence of consistent sets of facts are classified by Definition 61 as both ontology- and rule-based, their semantics is given both by ⋄ and by {a mathematical formula}S. This ambivalence is unavoidable if we want to allow both an ontology and a rule layer to contain only facts, or simply to be empty.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Nevertheless, if the semantics assigned to such sequences of fact bases by ⋄ differs from that assigned by {a mathematical formula}S, the resulting hybrid update semantics cannot generalise either ⋄ or {a mathematical formula}S. In order to avoid such anomalies, we assume that both ⋄ and {a mathematical formula}S respect fact update, as defined below.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">respects fact update if for every finite sequence of consistent sets of facts {a mathematical formula}P= 〈 Pi 〉 i<n, the unique {a mathematical formula}S-model of P is the LP interpretation{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">To formally illustrate this concept, we show that the set of models of a first-order theory {a mathematical formula}T is saturated relative to the set of predicate symbols that are relevant to {a mathematical formula}T.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">respects fact update if for every finite sequence of consistent sets of ground objective literals {a mathematical formula}T= 〈 Ti 〉 i<n,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Furthermore, these three basic assumptions about the first-order update operator ⋄ and rule update semantics {a mathematical formula}S are sufficient to guarantee that {a mathematical formula}( ⋄ ,S)-dynamic MKNF models are independent of the choice of the layering splitting sequence.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Note that since {a mathematical formula} 〈 P 〉 (i.e., the sequence containing the single element, {a mathematical formula}P) is a layering splitting sequence for any basic DMKB, it follows from Proposition 72 that the above definition is compatible with the previously defined semantics for basic DMKBs (cf.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">We assume throughout this section that both the first-order update operator ⋄ and the rule update semantics {a mathematical formula}S have the splitting sequence property, conserve the language and respect fact update.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">As with the update semantics in Section 3, assuming that ⋄ satisfies (FO1) and {a mathematical formula}S respects primacy of new information, the resulting hybrid semantics also respects it.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">More specifically, they considered the problem of determining whether {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ KA, where A is a ground generalised atom in an atom base associated with {a mathematical formula}K, and given that the underlying description logic of {a mathematical formula}O is DL.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">This follows from Proposition 23, Proposition 26, and the fact that for every first-order theory {a mathematical formula}T, {a mathematical formula} ◇ 〈 T 〉 =T, so the static consequence operator {a mathematical formula}TK coincides with the updating consequence operator {a mathematical formula}T 〈 K 〉 ⋄ .</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">This, together with the assumption that {a mathematical formula}M is an MKNF model of {a mathematical formula}K, implies that {a mathematical formula}(M ′ ,M) ⊭ Κ (K).</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">We can now apply Corollary 116 to conclude that {a mathematical formula}(X ′ ,X) ⊭ Κ (bU(K)), which is the desired conclusion.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">This, together with the assumption that {a mathematical formula}M is an MKNF model of {a mathematical formula}K, implies that {a mathematical formula}(M ′ ,M) ⊭ Κ (K).</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">We can now apply Corollary 117 to conclude that {a mathematical formula}(Y ′ ,Y) ⊭ Κ (eU(K,X)), which is the desired conclusion.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Also note that for any limit ordinal Α , {a mathematical formula}X Α =IL, so {a mathematical formula}X Α is saturated relative to any set of predicate symbols.The proofs in this section follow the same pattern as those in [92].</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">By Proposition 137, this holds if and only if{a mathematical formula} At the same time, the right hand side of our equivalence is true if and only if for some sequence of interpretations {a mathematical formula} 〈 I Α 〉 Α < Μ the following holds:{a mathematical formula} It remains to show that (C.12) is equivalent to (C.13).</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">Splitting theorem for rule updatesThe{a mathematical formula}RD-semantics for rule updates satisfies the Abstract Splitting Set Property and the Abstract Splitting Sequence Property.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">The desired result thus follows by the definition of {a mathematical formula}RD-models.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Language conservation is an immediate consequence of the definition of the {a mathematical formula}RD-semantics and of basic properties of the least model of a definite program.As for fact update, let {a mathematical formula}P= 〈 Pi 〉 i<n be a sequence of consistent sets of facts.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">Language conservation follows by induction on i from Proposition 69 and Lemma 146.As for fact update, let {a mathematical formula}T= 〈 Ti 〉 i<n be a finite sequence of consistent sets of ground objective literals.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">Let K be a basic DMKB and U a splitting sequence for K and suppose that both ⋄ and{a mathematical formula}Shave Abstract Splitting Sequence Property and respect fact update.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">If both ⋄ and{a mathematical formula}Shave the Abstract Splitting Sequence Property, conserve the language and respect fact update, then every{a mathematical formula}( ⋄ ,S)-dynamic MKNF model of K is sequence-saturated relative to A.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">Let {a mathematical formula}A= 〈 A Α 〉 Α < Μ and suppose that I is an interpretation such that for every {a mathematical formula} Α < Μ , {a mathematical formula}I[A Α ] ∈ Σ (M,U)[A Α ].</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">We need to prove that {a mathematical formula}I ∈ Σ (M,U).</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">It follows from the assumptions that for every {a mathematical formula} Α < Μ there exists some {a mathematical formula}J Α ∈ Σ (M,U) such that {a mathematical formula}I[A Α ]=J Α [A Α ] and some {a mathematical formula}K Α ∈ M such that {a mathematical formula}J Α [U]=K Α [U].</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">Let K be an interpretation such that for every ground atom p,{a mathematical formula} It follows that for every {a mathematical formula} Α < Μ , {a mathematical formula}K[A Α ]=K Α [A Α ] ∈ M[A Α ], so since {a mathematical formula}M is sequence-saturated relative to U, {a mathematical formula}K ∈ M.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">One of the last steps in the proof is to show that {a mathematical formula}M is sequence-saturated relative to B.</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">We know from Corollary 149 that {a mathematical formula}X Α is sequence-saturated relative to B, so we obtain the following:{a mathematical formula} which implies that {a mathematical formula}M is sequence-saturated relative to B.</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">Follows by the fact that K is basic, so {a mathematical formula}U= 〈 P 〉 is a layering splitting sequence for K. Thus, by Proposition 72, {a mathematical formula}M is a {a mathematical formula}( ⋄ ,S)-dynamic MKNF model of K if and only if {a mathematical formula}M corresponds some {a mathematical formula}S-stable model of {a mathematical formula} 〈 Pi 〉 i<n.</a>
<a href="#57" id="57">Furthermore,{a mathematical formula} On the other hand, if {a mathematical formula} Φ = Κ ( Π ) for some rule Π , then the there exists a unique non-limit ordinal Α such that {a mathematical formula}pr(H Π ) ⊆ A Α .</a>
<a href="#58" id="58">By the Abstract Splitting Sequence Property of ⋄ it follows that{a mathematical formula} Furthermore, it follows from the definition of generalised solution that {a mathematical formula}X Α is saturated relative to {a mathematical formula}A Α , so by Observation 100(2) and Lemma 156,{a mathematical formula} We prove that for all {a mathematical formula} Α < Μ , {a mathematical formula}X Α ⊆ 〚 ◇ bA Α (T) 〛 :</a>
<a href="#59" id="59">By the Abstract Splitting Sequence Property of ⋄ it follows that{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula}X Α = Σ (M,A Α ) for all {a mathematical formula} Α < Μ .</a>
