<a href="#1" id="1">(Pareto)-dominanceGiven a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M, a pattern x dominates another pattern y with respect to M, denoted by {a mathematical formula}x ≻ My, iff for any measure {a mathematical formula}m ∈ M, {a mathematical formula}m(x) ≥ m(y) and there exists {a mathematical formula}m ∈ M such that {a mathematical formula}m(x)>m(y).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Two patterns x and y are said to be indistinct with respect to M, denoted by {a mathematical formula}x=My, iff {a mathematical formula}m(x) equals {a mathematical formula}m(y) for any measure {a mathematical formula}m ∈ M (if {a mathematical formula}M= ∅ , then {a mathematical formula}x= ∅ y).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, {a mathematical formula}x ⪰ My denotes that {a mathematical formula}(x ≻ My) ∨ (x=My).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Definition 2</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Skypattern operatorGiven a pattern set {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ L and a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M, a skypattern of P with respect to M is a pattern not dominated by any pattern in P with respect to M. The skypattern operator {a mathematical formula}Sky(P,M) returns all the skypatterns of P with respect to M:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Problem 1</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M, the skypattern mining problem is to evaluate the query{a mathematical formula}Sky(L,M).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Definition 3</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Minimal skylineabilityGiven a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊆ M, a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M is said to be (strictly) minimally {a mathematical formula}M ′ -skylineable iff for any patterns x and y such that {a mathematical formula}x ⊂ y and {a mathematical formula}x=M ′ y, one has {a mathematical formula}x ⪰ My (respectively {a mathematical formula}x ≻ My).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Definition 4</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Maximal skylineabilityGiven a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊆ M, a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M is said to be (strictly) maximally {a mathematical formula}M ′ -skylineable iff for any patterns x and y such that {a mathematical formula}x ⊂ y and {a mathematical formula}x=M ′ y, one has {a mathematical formula}y ⪰ Mx (respectively {a mathematical formula}y ≻ Mx).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Proof</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M be a set of measures.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊆ M be the set of all unary primitives defined on {a mathematical formula}L. Let x and y be two patterns such that {a mathematical formula}x=M ′ y.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Let {a mathematical formula}m ∈ M.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As {a mathematical formula}x=m ′ y for any primitive {a mathematical formula}m ′ ∈ M ′ and m is composed of such primitives, thus {a mathematical formula}x=my.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We conclude that {a mathematical formula}x=My and then, {a mathematical formula}x ⪰ My and {a mathematical formula}y ⪰ Mx.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Given a primitive-based measure {a mathematical formula}m ∈ M, the minimal skylineable converter returns a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ =c_(m) guaranteeing that for any pattern {a mathematical formula}x ⊂ y, if {a mathematical formula}x=M ′ y then {a mathematical formula}m(x) ≥ m(y).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In other words, x dominates y with respect to m. Dually, the maximal converter {a mathematical formula}c ‾ guarantees that {a mathematical formula}m(x) ≤ m(y) for any pattern {a mathematical formula}x ⊂ y such that {a mathematical formula}x=c ‾ (m)y.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Definition 5</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Minimal and maximal skylineable convertersThe minimal and maximal skylineable converters defined by Table 3 for any primitive-based measure are naturally extended to a set of primitive-based measures {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ M: {a mathematical formula}c ‾ (M)= ⋃ m ∈ Mc ‾ (m) and {a mathematical formula}c_(M)= ⋃ m ∈ Mc_(m).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Definition 6</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Distinct operatorGiven a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊆ M, the distinct operator for {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ L with respect to {a mathematical formula}M ′ and {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ { ⊂ , ⊃ } returns all the patterns x of P such that their generalizations (or specializations) are distinct from x with respect to {a mathematical formula}M ′ :{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ { ⊂ , ⊃ }.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Given a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ , the set of free (respectively closed) patterns adequate to {a mathematical formula}M ′ corresponds exactly to {a mathematical formula}Dis ⊂ (L,M ′ ) (respectively {a mathematical formula}Dis ⊃ (L,M ′ )).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">For instance, from our running example, {a mathematical formula}Dis ⊂ (L,{freq})={A,B,C,D,E,F,AD,AE,BC,BD,BE,CD,CE,DE} and {a mathematical formula}Dis ⊃ (L,{freq})={A,D,E,AB,AC,ABCDEF}.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Definition 7</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Indistinct operatorGiven a set of measures {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊆ M, the indistinct operator returns all the patterns of {a mathematical formula}L being indistinct with respect to {a mathematical formula}M ′ with at least one pattern in P.{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">For instance, from Table 1a, the set of patterns that have exactly the same frequency as patterns B or C is {a mathematical formula}Ind(L,{freq},{AB,AC})={B,C,AB,AC}.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The technique is even more efficient if the set of measures is strictly{a mathematical formula}M ′ -skylineable.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">In this case, the {a mathematical formula}Ind operator can be skipped and Theorem 1 is reduced to the following relation: {a mathematical formula}Sky(L,M)=Sky(Dis Θ (L,M ′ ),M) (with {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ { ⊂ , ⊃ }).</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">For each method, we report the CPU-time and the number of skypatterns for every query on the selected set of measures.</a>
