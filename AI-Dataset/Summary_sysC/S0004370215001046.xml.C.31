<a href="#0" id="0">In this section, we use the phrase “ constraint condition ” to denote how to assemble candidate features with specific relevant information.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Constraint conditions are employed to generate combined features and to capture local dependency information.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For every candidate feature, an appropriate constraint condition is selected for its assembly with relevant information to maximize the discrimination power.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Based on the constraint conditions, our feature assembly method summarizes the techniques used in feature combinations, thereby providing a more systematic way to assemble the candidate features.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Table 5, the weak performance of the collection constraint is because relation arguments (entity) are order sensitive, so the collective features cannot capture local dependency information in this situation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For example, in entity type and subtype, each collective feature (e.g., {person, location}) appears in both the positive and negative instances with almost identical distributions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish them using only this feature.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Rows 4, 5, and 6 show the impact of different constraint conditions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Row 4 shows the performance when all of the candidate features were used as singleton features, which indicates that the performance decreased considerably, thereby demonstrating that the lack of local dependency information for relation extraction can degrade the performance.</a>
