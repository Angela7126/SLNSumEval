<a href="#0" id="0">Interestingly, the problem of determining whether a given symbol translation {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ PROPYX satisfies REV is a specific case of the following problem of propositional matching (given 2n formulae {a mathematical formula} Α 1, Β 1, … , Α n, Β n, determining whether there exists a substitution Θ from {a mathematical formula}X= ⋃ i=1nVar( Α i) to {a mathematical formula}PROPY with {a mathematical formula}Y= ⋃ i=1nVar( Β i) such that for {a mathematical formula}i ∈ 1, … ,n, {a mathematical formula} Θ ( Α i) ≡ Β i).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first show that the distance-based merging operator {a mathematical formula} Δ dD, Σ is AIP-language independent.Let {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ PS, E be a profile of bases containing formulae from {a mathematical formula}PROPX, Μ be a formula from {a mathematical formula}PROPX and Σ be a symbol translation from {a mathematical formula}PROPYX satisfying AIP.By construction, the models of {a mathematical formula} Δ Μ dD, Σ (E) are precisely the models of Μ satisfying a maximal number of bases in the profile E.Let {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ be an interpretation over Y such that {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ ⊨ Σ ( Μ ); since Μ is equivalent to the disjunction of all its canonical terms associated with its models, there must exist an interpretation Ω over X such that {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ ⊨ Σ ( Ω ).Consider now any Ω be an interpretation over X, and {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ an interpretation over Y such that {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ ⊨ Σ ( Ω ).</a>
