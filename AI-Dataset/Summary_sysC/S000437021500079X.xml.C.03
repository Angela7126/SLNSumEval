<a href="#0" id="0">Using these definitions, the automated process of configuring static sequential portfolios can be defined as follows: Given a set of candidate solvers P and a set of training instances I automatically find the portfolio configuration C of solvers {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P such that it maximizes the performance of the resulting portfolio over the given benchmark I.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This approach runs all candidate solvers to be part in the portfolio with every training instance in the same planning domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The proposed approach derives the optimal static sequential portfolio (to be denoted as OSS portfolio) for a specific metric and a given training set; i.e., the optimal combination of solvers for a particular performance criteria with regard to the set of candidate solvers and the training benchmark considered.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">And the last one solves a MIP task to compute the optimal sequential schedule of candidate solvers that maximizes the number of solved training instances using 10% of the available time.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, the resulting portfolio achieves the best performance in the training set and minimizes the execution time in that instance set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">gop automatically derives an optimal combination of solvers with regard to the set of candidate solvers and the set of training problems.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Third, the MIP task generates the optimal configuration of a static sequential portfolio for the collection of training problems and candidate solvers.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Otherwise, the value 1 means that the solver {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P has found the best solution for the training instance {a mathematical formula}t ∈ I (with regard to the solutions found by the set of candidate solvers P).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">On the other hand, each candidate solver {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P can be assigned by the MIP to solve a subset of training instances {a mathematical formula}t ∈ I, each one with a particular solution {a mathematical formula}s ∈ Spt.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As mentioned above, the MIP only selects one solution {a mathematical formula}s ∈ Spt found by a solver {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P to solve each particular training problem {a mathematical formula}t ∈ I even if other solvers solve it as well.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, in this section we analyze the question of whether there is a subset of the training problems that results in a portfolio with a similar or even equal performance (measured in overall quality or coverage) with regard to the same set of candidate solvers.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, when optimizing quality, if all training problems are solved by all solvers with the same quality, they do not provide any utility to configure the OSS portfolio since any combination of the candidate solvers will provide the same result.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Similarly, the training problems that are not solved by any solver are equally irrelevant since the MIP task will not be able to distinguish between an empty portfolio or a particular combination of the candidate solvers.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The first experiment aims to compute the OSS portfolio for the sequential optimization track of the IPC 2011, which allows us to analyze the performance of any solver on that particular benchmark.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since in this experiment we test the performance with the same training instances, the resulting portfolio provides us only with the best achievable performance given the participant planners and instances of the IPC.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Therefore, we have computed the OSS portfolio (OSS gop-1) for the new domains defined in the IPC 2011 using the same set of candidate planners considered by fdss and gop-1.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The 3S MIP task defined for 1,200 training instances and 52 candidate solvers was solved in 205.71 seconds.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Table A.7 shows the candidate planners considered to compute the OSS portfolio for the sequential optimization track of the IPC 2011 in Section 6.1.1.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The set of candidate planners used in Section 6.1.3 to assess the performance of the portfolios computed with gop in optimal planning is shown in Table A.8.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The OSS portfolio for the sequential satisficing track of the IPC 2011 has been configured in Section 6.2.1 with the set of candidate planners shown in Table A.9.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Finally, Table A.12 shows the set of candidate solvers used to compute the OSS portfolio for the open track of the SAT Competition 2013 in Section 7.1.</a>
