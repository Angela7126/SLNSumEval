<a href="#0" id="0">Our improved algorithm consists of two steps: (i) first we construct a special type of a belief-observation POMDP; and we show that there exists a finite-memory almost-sure winning strategy for the objective {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 iff there exists a randomized memoryless almost-sure winning strategy in the belief-observation POMDP for the {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 objective; and (ii) then we show how to determine whether there exists a randomized memoryless almost-sure winning strategy in the belief-observation POMDP for the {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 objective in polynomial time with respect to the size of the belief-observation POMDP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Otherwise for all states {a mathematical formula}s¯ ∈ Γ ¯ − 1(W ⁎ ) ∖ X ⁎ the strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ ⁎ plays only actions in {a mathematical formula}Allow( Γ ¯(s¯),W ⁎ ), and then the probability to reach {a mathematical formula}X ⁎ is zero, i.e., {a mathematical formula}Safe( Γ ¯ − 1(W ⁎ ) ∖ X ⁎ ) is ensured.</a>
