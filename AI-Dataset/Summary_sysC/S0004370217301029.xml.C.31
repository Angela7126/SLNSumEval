<a href="#1" id="1">Training{a mathematical formula}Cs(s,a)and{a mathematical formula}Ps(s,a,s ′ ,C(s,a)): We define {a mathematical formula}Cs(s,a) as the expected time for completing a by an average human operator and {a mathematical formula}Ps(s,a,s ′ ,C(s,a)) as the probability for transitioning from s to {a mathematical formula}s ′ using advice a, given {a mathematical formula}Cs(s,a).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To train {a mathematical formula}Cs(s,a) and {a mathematical formula}Ps(s,a,s ′ ,C(s,a)), we recruited 30 Computer Science undergraduate students, ranging in age from 18 to 34 (mean=25, s.d.=3.4) with similar demographics to participate in a simulated SAR task equipped with a naïve advising agent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given state s, our naïve agent provided advice a which, upon completion, is expected to bring about a new state {a mathematical formula}s ′ , where {a mathematical formula}Rs(s ′ )+5s<Rs(s).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">That is, the agent suggests advice that, if completed successfully, will reduce (at least) 5 s from the expected time to find the next object.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Similar to the naïve agent in the warehouse operation task (Section 4.1.1), the agent only offers advice which can be completed and only if the human operator is not currently engaged in the suggested task (for example, if a robot has malfunctioned the agent will not advise tele-operating it, but it might advise fixing the robot).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The agent presents the advice in both textual format (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">2) as well as a prerecorded, human-voice message played in the operator's head-set.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that the agent filters and prioritizes robots' requests and messages, yet in a naïve way.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For motivation, subjects were paid 1 NIS (about 25 cents) per green object they found, and 0.5 NIS per advice to which they adhere.</a>
