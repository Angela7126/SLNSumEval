<a href="#0" id="0">To induce a qualitative model with respect to a certain attribute {a mathematical formula}Ai, we first compute the PDQ PD for the entire learning set: for each example, we compute the set of dependent values {a mathematical formula}D and find the total ordering of attribute values {a mathematical formula}Ai as explained in the previous two sections.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We replace the original class labels with partial derivatives (that is, the total ordering) and induce a model for predicting the ordering.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In principle, any learning algorithm can be used for this task.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}S=no âˆ§ L=yes: Ball L is blocking the left rail-first shot which makes both direct shots preferred over the rail-first shots.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The preference of direct shots is the same as above while both rail-first shots are equally preferred.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We again built a qualitative tree from the entire data set, taking the PDQ PD as the class variable.</a>
