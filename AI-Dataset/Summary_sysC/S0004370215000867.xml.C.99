<a href="#0" id="0">When applied to the standard set of instances this approach improves heuristic values on initial states, detects considerable more deadlocks in random states, and doubles the number of optimally solved instances compared to previous methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A weighted state space problem {a mathematical formula}P=(S,A,s,T,w) consists of a set of states S, a finite set of actions A, an initial state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S, a set of goal states {a mathematical formula}T ⊆ S, and a cost function {a mathematical formula}w:A → R.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each action {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A is a function {a mathematical formula}a:S → S that transforms a state into a successor state incurring cost {a mathematical formula}w(a).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this section, we describe how instances can be decomposed into a maze zone and a goal zone and define an intermediate goal state, explain the construction and storage of the PDB, introduce a new heuristic, and show how to compute it efficiently.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Linear conflictA triple {a mathematical formula}(q,r,m) ∈ Q3 where squares q and r are adjacent is a linear conflict if for an instance in state {a mathematical formula}u=(m,p) ∈ S with only two stones placed at q and r, and for all states {a mathematical formula}u ′ ∈ Succ(u), {a mathematical formula}hMM(u ′ ) ≥ hMM(u)+1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Two stones {a mathematical formula}b,b ′ ∈ B of an arbitrary instance in state {a mathematical formula}u=(m,p) ∈ S are in a linear conflict, if {a mathematical formula}(p(b),p(b ′ ),m) is a linear conflict.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}L(u) be the maximum number of linear conflicts in state {a mathematical formula}u ∈ S such that each stone is part of at most one linear conflict.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">(The value {a mathematical formula}L(u) is the size of a maximum matching in the conflict graph over the stones, where stones in linear conflict are connected by an edge.)</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Using the proposed heuristic function and breaking ties by generation order explores more than 5 million nodes to solve the instance, since several possible configurations of the stones on goal squares are explored before reaching the goal node.</a>
