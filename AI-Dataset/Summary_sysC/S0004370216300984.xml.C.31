<a href="#0" id="0">The instances are not too easy – Comparing solvers on trivial instances that any solver can solve is not interesting and can be disadvantageous for complex solvers using advanced and novel techniques.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First we randomly selected 3 out of the top 7 solvers from the previous competition (participants of the Sequential and Application {a mathematical formula}SAT+UNSAT Tracks of the SAT Competition 2014).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this year's SAT Race we did five runs for each solver benchmark pair.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{sup:4} The solvers were compared based on the average number of problem instances solved within the time limit of one hour in the five runs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A common way of designing a parallel SAT solver is the so called portfolio approach.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A portfolio is a collection of SAT solvers (different SAT solvers or different versions of the same SAT solver).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The solvers are ran on the same problem in parallel until one of them finds a solution.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The solvers can additionally exchange useful information such as learned clauses or variable activity statistics.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">All current state-of-the-art parallel SAT solvers are based on this approach (judging by the results of recent SAT competitions).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the 2015 SAT Race we introduced a new track for solvers supporting interactive incremental SAT solving – the Incremental Library Track (ILT).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The ILT differs significantly from all the other (traditional) tracks of the SAT competitions in the following aspects:</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The benchmarks for the traditional tracks are text files specifying a CNF formula.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">A benchmark for the ILT is an application (and inputs for it) that uses SAT solvers interactively.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The input of the Essentials application is CNF Boolean formulas – same as SAT solvers.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In the 2015 SAT Race we selected the 50 easiest instances of the Main Track as benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Based on the total number of solved problems, percentage of problems solved and relative ranking in each benchmark category we decided to award two first prizes to the solvers CoMinisatPS and CryptoMiniSat and the third prize to the solver Glucose.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">One possible explanation for this high similarity of SAT solvers is that it is a negative side-effect of SAT competitions, in particular their benchmark selection method.</a>
