<a href="#0" id="0">For any belief function Bel on a distributive lattice L, we define{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Μ ⩾ Bel means that, for all {a mathematical formula}x ∈ L, {a mathematical formula} Μ (x) ⩾ Bel(x).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that {a mathematical formula}Bel ∘ is not necessarily a probability function on L because {a mathematical formula}Bel ∘ ( ⊤ ) may not be equal to 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">So a Bayesian belief function (or probability function) Μ on a distributive lattice {a mathematical formula}L=J(P) for some poset P is more like a point function than a set function in its level of complexity in the sense that Μ is determined by its values at elements of P (which correspond to principal order ideals in P) rather by its values at all order ideals of P (all values at non-principal order ideals are 0).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let ʼ s consider a probability function Pr on the structure called measurable space{a mathematical formula} 〈 S,A 〉 where S is a finite sample space and {a mathematical formula}A is an algebra on S and is a subclass of {a mathematical formula}2S.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let L be a distributive lattice and Bel be a belief function on L. Define{a mathematical formula} Every element {a mathematical formula}a ∈ LBel is called Bel-measurable or simply measurable when the context is clear.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If Μ is a probability function on {a mathematical formula}L ′ , then, for each element {a mathematical formula}x ∈ L, we can define</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">According to the definition, {a mathematical formula}LD=J(PD).The probability structure {a mathematical formula}M:= 〈 P,L,L ′ , Μ ,v 〉 is defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We take {a mathematical formula}{A ⁎ :A ∈ J(PD)} to be the “ basis ” for the distributive lattice {a mathematical formula}L ′ in the sense that {a mathematical formula}L ′ is the set of all finite unions of elements {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We can show by induction on the complexity of Φ that, for all formulas {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Φ 0, {a mathematical formula}v( Φ )={(B,s):s ∈ vD( Φ ) ∩ B,B ∈ J(PD)}.Now we will show that such defined probability structure {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 P,L,L ′ , Μ ,v 〉 is equivalent to the belief structure D. For each formula Φ and {a mathematical formula}A ∈ J(PD), we have {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ ⊆ v( Φ ) iff {a mathematical formula}(A,s) ∈ v( Φ ) for all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ A iff {a mathematical formula}s ∈ vD( Φ ) for all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ A iff {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ vD( Φ ).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">On the other hand, given any possible-world-like structure for the logic {a mathematical formula}L, the interpretations of the formulas is an algebra that characterizes {a mathematical formula}L. So, in the following section, before we reason about belief functions on specific classes of algebras, we elaborate on this kind of duality between logics and their corresponding algebraic structures (and possible-world-like semantics) and won ʼ t distinguish belief functions on algebras and for their logics.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Given a basic belief formula {a mathematical formula}f:=a1bel( Φ 1)+a2bel( Φ 2)+ ⋯ +akbel( Φ k) ⩾ b and a probability structure {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 S,L,L ′ ,v, Μ 〉 on a Routley structure {a mathematical formula}S:= 〈 S, ⩽ ,g,v 〉 where {a mathematical formula}L=J(S), {a mathematical formula}L ′ is a sublattice of L and Μ is a probability function on {a mathematical formula}L ′ , M satisfies f (denoted as {a mathematical formula}M ⊨ f) if{a mathematical formula}We then extend the above ⊨ in the obvious way to all belief formulas.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The completeness proof is similar to that of the system AX with respect to the class of general probability structures in [19] except that we need to replace propositional reasoning with reasoning about first degree entailments.Fix a belief formula f. Without loss of generality, we may assume that f is a conjunction of basic belief formulas and negated basic belief formulas.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Then f is satisfied in a probability structure on a Boolean algebra with at most{a mathematical formula}|f|2states, with a basis of size at most{a mathematical formula}|f|, where the probability assigned to each member of the basis is a rational number with size{a mathematical formula}O(|f| ‖ f ‖ +|f|log(|f|)).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Actually the whole argument there works to show that each DS structure {a mathematical formula}B:= 〈 S, ⩽ ,g,v,Bel 〉 on a de Morgan lattice {a mathematical formula}J(S) (or on a Routley structure {a mathematical formula} 〈 S, ⩽ ,g,v 〉 ) is equivalent to a probability structure {a mathematical formula}M:= 〈 S ′ ,L,L ′ ,v ′ , Μ ′ 〉 where {a mathematical formula}L=2S ′ , {a mathematical formula}L ′ is a Boolean algebra and {a mathematical formula} Μ ′ is a probability function on {a mathematical formula}L ′ in the sense that, for any formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Φ ,{a mathematical formula}Note that, compared to Theorems 3.22 (and Corollary 3.23), our equivalence here is stronger because the language Φ here includes the negation ∼ while {a mathematical formula} Φ 0 in Theorems 3.22 (and Corollary 3.23) does not.</a>
