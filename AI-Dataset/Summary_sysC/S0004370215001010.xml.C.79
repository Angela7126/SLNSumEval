<a href="#0" id="0">Both contributions together result in relational linear programming, best summarized as{a mathematical formula} The user describes a relational problem in a high-level, relational LP modeling language and — given a logical knowledge base (LogKB) encoding some individuals or rather data — the system automatically compiles a symmetry-reduced LP that in turn can be solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In both ‘ atomic ’ cases, this will generate a finite set of ground equality constraints; one for each answer of the free variables of {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 unified with Φ .From this, by induction, it follows that any combination of {a mathematical formula}n>1 many LP atoms and constants using arithmetic operators induces only a finite set of ground instances.What remains are {an inline-figure} statements.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume a single {a mathematical formula}{an inline-figure}{Y{an inline-figure} Φ ′ }{ Ψ } string for some par-expression Ψ of length n, which does not include any other {an inline-figure} statement.Now, by our induction base, Ψ itself would result in a finite set of ground arithmetic expressions as long as its free variables have been bound.</a>
