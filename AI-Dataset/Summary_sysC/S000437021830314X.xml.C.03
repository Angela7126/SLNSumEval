<a href="#0" id="0">Either way, we let {a mathematical formula} Φ [t] denote the formula with the restored situation term t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, we might introduce a new formula A by {a mathematical formula}A ≐ Φ , where {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ L.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is, the result of doing an action a at situation s is the situation {a mathematical formula}do(a,s).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a sequence of actions {a mathematical formula}a1 through {a mathematical formula}an, we are often interested in asking whether Φ holds after these:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Suppose {a mathematical formula} ∫ aMbMgM(x)dx=cM, that is, {a mathematical formula}gM is integrable.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The agent knowing Φ at situation s, written {a mathematical formula}Knows( Φ ,s), is the following abbreviation:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For such actions, we simply write{a mathematical formula} in which case the p value of s is the same as that for {a mathematical formula}do(move(3),s).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Formally, we add action likelihood axioms to {a mathematical formula}D:</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Notice, for example, that Bel is well-defined only when the sum over all those situations {a mathematical formula}s ′ such that {a mathematical formula} Φ [s ′ ] holds is finite.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Under the assumption (P3), we can rewrite Definition 12 for {a mathematical formula}s=S0 as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula}T ⊆ S be such that {a mathematical formula}s ∈ T iff {a mathematical formula} Φ [s].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">(Degrees of belief (reformulated)) Let Φ be any {a mathematical formula}L-formula.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For example, if the robot were to now move away by 4 units, the belief in {a mathematical formula}h=4 would then be .2.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The degree of belief in Φ at s is an abbreviation:{a mathematical formula} where, as in Definition 16, if {a mathematical formula}s=do( Α ,S0) then{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let a denote {a mathematical formula}obs(z).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">To see how that gets used with the new action types such as {a mathematical formula}move(x,y), consider the ground action {a mathematical formula}move(3,3.1).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">(Degrees of belief (continuous noisy effectors and sensors)) Suppose Φ is any {a mathematical formula}L-formula.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The initial theory {a mathematical formula}D0 includes the following p specification:{a mathematical formula} For simplicity, let h be the only fluent in the domain, and assume that actions are always executable.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">More precisely, we have{a mathematical formula} If the action were deterministic, yet again the degree of belief about {a mathematical formula}h ≥ 10 would be 1 after the intended actions.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">To be precise, the degree of belief in {a mathematical formula}h ≤ 4 after the sensing action is:{a mathematical formula} This then amounts to 3/11.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">(Degrees of belief (discrete and continuous fluents, sensors and effectors)) Suppose Φ is any {a mathematical formula}L-formula.</a>
