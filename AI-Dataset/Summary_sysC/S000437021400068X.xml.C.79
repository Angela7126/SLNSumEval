<a href="#115" id="115">Consequently, Theorem 2 also fails for {a mathematical formula}P( □ ◇ ).</a>
<a href="#116" id="116">It may be argued that the correct formulation of Theorem 2 should replace the inf operation on the right-hand side with the corresponding t-norm for {a mathematical formula} Ł ( □ ◇ ) and {a mathematical formula}P( □ ◇ ), since the symbol ⇔ has been interpreted by using the respective residua.</a>
<a href="#117" id="117">Note that, for the degenerated weighted social network, the logics {a mathematical formula} Ł ( □ ◇ ) and {a mathematical formula}P( □ ◇ ) are reduced to propositional Ł ukasiewicz logic and propositional product logic respectively, because the set of modalities is empty.</a>
<a href="#118" id="118">Thus, the degenerated weighted social network is simply a set of fuzzy interpretations for these two propositional logics.</a>
<a href="#119" id="119">However, because the second condition of regular similarity is vacuously true for the degenerated case, Theorem 2 fails no matter how the relational composition is defined.</a>

<a href="#122" id="122">In general, a t-conorm ⊕ that corresponds to a t-norm ⊗ is defined as {a mathematical formula}a ⊕ b=1 − (1 − a) ⊗ (1 − b) for any {a mathematical formula}a,b ∈ [0,1].</a>
<a href="#123" id="123">Let us consider the weighted social network {a mathematical formula}N=(U,P,R) shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#124" id="124">If we define GRE by using the Ł ukasiewicz t-conorm (i.e., {a mathematical formula}a ⊕ b=min(a+b,1)) in Eq.</a>
<a href="#125" id="125">2(b) would be a counterexample of Theorem 6 if we use the product t-conorm (i.e., {a mathematical formula}a ⊕ b=a+b − a ⋅ b) in the definition of GRE and the semantics of the modal formulas.</a>
<a href="#126" id="126">Assume that a weighted social network {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i ∈ I,(Rj)j ∈ J) is stored in a data center and for some subset {a mathematical formula}Is ⊆ I, {a mathematical formula}Pi is a confidential attribute (e.g.</a>
<a href="#127" id="127">Let {a mathematical formula}L denote the query language.</a>
<a href="#128" id="128">Then, for any query Φ (i.e., a formula of {a mathematical formula}L) with respect to the network {a mathematical formula}N, the answer set is {a mathematical formula}ans( Φ ,N)={(x,deg(x, Φ ))|x ∈ U,deg(x, Φ ) ≠ 0}, where {a mathematical formula}deg(x, Φ ) is the degree of satisfaction of Φ for an actor x.</a>
<a href="#129" id="129">Thus, with the answer set, the user can exclude the possibility of {a mathematical formula}de(x)=w if {a mathematical formula}deg(x, Φ ) ≠ deg(w, Φ ) for any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ U and {a mathematical formula}w ∈ W.</a>
<a href="#130" id="130">Because de is an isomorphism, we have {a mathematical formula}V(Xi, Φ )=V(de(Xi), Φ ) for {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≤ k and {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ L, where the truth value of a formula in an equivalence class is defined in the proof of Theorem 3.</a>
<a href="#131" id="131">Furthermore, for {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ k, there exists a formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ L such that {a mathematical formula}V(Xi, Φ ) ≠ V(Xj, Φ ).</a>
<a href="#132" id="132">This means that an attacker can identify each equivalence class {a mathematical formula}Xi on U with its corresponding equivalence class {a mathematical formula}de(Xi) on W, even though he can not identify {a mathematical formula}de(x) for any individual {a mathematical formula}x ∈ U.</a>
<a href="#133" id="133">For example, if there exists an equivalence class {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ U such that {a mathematical formula}|X|=1, it means that there exists an actor {a mathematical formula}x ∈ U such that it is possible to uniquely locate {a mathematical formula}de(x) in {a mathematical formula}N0 by querying the data center several times.</a>
<a href="#134" id="134">Another case of privacy invasion occurs when there exists an equivalence class {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ U such that for all {a mathematical formula}u ∈ X, {a mathematical formula}Pi(u) is the same for some {a mathematical formula}i ∈ Is.</a>
<a href="#135" id="135">In this case, the attacker knows {a mathematical formula}N0 and X's corresponding equivalence class {a mathematical formula}Y=de(X) ⊆ W; therefore, he can evaluate the truth value of the confidential attribute {a mathematical formula}Pi with respect to each element of Y and derive that {a mathematical formula}Pi(u)=Pi(w) for any {a mathematical formula}w ∈ Y and {a mathematical formula}u ∈ X because de is an isomorphism.</a>
<a href="#136" id="136">Formal definitions of privacy criteria based on the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation can be found in [37], [38].</a>
<a href="#137" id="137">From the above analysis, it is clear that the data center must compute the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation on {a mathematical formula}N for the privacy assessment.</a>
<a href="#138" id="138">However, because the number of formulas of a logical language is infinite in general, the direct computation of the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation is not effective.</a>
<a href="#139" id="139">In other words, to directly determine if two actors x and y are {a mathematical formula}L-equivalent, we have to evaluate and compare {a mathematical formula}V(x, Φ ) and {a mathematical formula}V(y, Φ ) for each formula Φ in {a mathematical formula}L. However, because the number of formulas is infinite, it is impossible to complete the process in a finite number of steps.</a>
<a href="#140" id="140">However, by using the characterization results provided in this paper, the computation of the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation can be reduced to the computation of the corresponding GRE or regular similarity of {a mathematical formula}L. In [27], [28], an effective procedure is presented for the computation of GRE and regular similarity over Gödel structure.</a>
<a href="#141" id="141">Therefore, the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation can be computed effectively.</a>
<a href="#142" id="142">Although the analysis of the complexity of these algorithms and their computational properties are beyond the scope of the paper, we remark that the algorithms are based on an iterative refinement procedure proposed in [7] for computing the coarsest regular equivalence of an ordinary social network, which has {a mathematical formula}O(n3)-time complexity.</a>
<a href="#143" id="143">A more sophisticated algorithm with {a mathematical formula}O(mlog2n)-time complexity exists for an ordinary social network, where m and n are, respectively, the number of links and the number of nodes in the network [45].</a>
<a href="#144" id="144">In general, our results show that the computation of {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence can be reduced to the computation of GRE if the query language {a mathematical formula}L is one of the languages mentioned in Theorem 3, Theorem 4; and it can be reduced to the computation of regular similarity if the query language is {a mathematical formula}G( □ ◇ ) or {a mathematical formula}G( ◇ ).</a>
<a href="#145" id="145">In fact, there also exist works on fuzzy description logics [4], [5], [32], that are inter-translatable with our {a mathematical formula}G( □ ◇ ) language.</a>
