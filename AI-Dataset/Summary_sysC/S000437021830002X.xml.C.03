<a href="#0" id="0">To argue feasibility, first observe that any {a mathematical formula}A ∈ F ′ must be satisfied by Α since Α and {a mathematical formula} Α ′ only differ on variables which do not occur in {a mathematical formula}I ′ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">there exists a solution Α of I of value {a mathematical formula}w= Η ( Α ) if and only if there exists a solution {a mathematical formula} Α ′ of {a mathematical formula}I ′ of value w, and</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">a solution Α can be computed from any solution {a mathematical formula} Α ′ in linear time.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Third, it transforms the solution {a mathematical formula} Α ′ into a solution Α of I. Correctness follows from Lemma 11 and Theorem 1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also observe that the maximum absolute value of any coefficient in {a mathematical formula}I ′ is at most 1.</a>
