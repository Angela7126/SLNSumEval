<a href="#0" id="0">We provide an upper bound on the number of times the algorithm selects a suboptimal expert set for a given problem, which depends on the target accuracy level and the true qualities (Theorem 4.2).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The output of the algorithm will be the subset {a mathematical formula}St and predicted opinion {a mathematical formula}y ˆ t for each task t. The predicted opinion {a mathematical formula}y ˆ t is decided based on an aggregation function (AGGREGATE) in Definition 4.1 with noisy opinions {a mathematical formula}y ˜ (St) collected from the expert set {a mathematical formula}St as input.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If an expert r does not belong to{an inline-figure}for some task t in CCB-SE, then, with known qualities, GA algorithm has a candidate solution of cost less than or equal to any candidate solution containing r with probability{a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ).With true qualities, in GA algorithm, the elements {a mathematical formula}1, … ,k precedes r due to {a mathematical formula}cka ˆ k − ≤ cra ˆ r+ with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ).As {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,k} meets the accuracy constraint with LCB, they meet it with true qualities also (with high probability).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We extend the algorithm to the AAB setting by exploring all the experts with probability {a mathematical formula} Ε t and selecting minimum cost expert subset meeting the constraint with empirically estimated qualities with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Ε t).</a>
