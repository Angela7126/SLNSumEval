<a href="#0" id="0">These methods have a common modus operandi to determining the experiment {a mathematical formula} Θ t at time step t: construct a utility function {a mathematical formula}ut based on the posterior GP conditioned on the queries so far; then maximise {a mathematical formula}ut to determine {a mathematical formula} Θ t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Precisely,{a mathematical formula} Here {a mathematical formula}p+ ∈ R is sampled from {a mathematical formula}L ˜ ( Θ +), the uncertainty of the log joint probability at {a mathematical formula} Θ +.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The density h is sampled from {a mathematical formula}F Θ |Xobs, the uncertainty model of the posterior obtained by adding {a mathematical formula}( Θ +,p+) to the set of already available points {a mathematical formula}At − 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Both {a mathematical formula}L ˜ ( Θ +) and {a mathematical formula}F Θ |Xobs are induced from the log joint GP as explained before.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}P ˆ m+1A ∪ {( Θ +,p+)} denotes the estimate of the posterior obtained by re-training the GP with {a mathematical formula}( Θ +,p+) as the tth point along with the t points already available.</a>
