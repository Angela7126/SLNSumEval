<a href="#0" id="0">Testing subsumption between feature terms {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Ψ 2, as defined in Section 2.2, can be formalized as a CSP as follows:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given two terms {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Ψ 2, which have n and m variables respectively, we know that there is at least one antiunification with at most {a mathematical formula}n×m variables, which subsumes {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 with a mapping {a mathematical formula}m1 and {a mathematical formula} Ψ 2 with a mapping {a mathematical formula}m2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1, {a mathematical formula} Ψ 2 and Ψ be terms with n, m and k variables, such that {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 ⊑ Ψ and {a mathematical formula} Ψ 2 ⊑ Ψ .</a>
