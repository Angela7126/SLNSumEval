<a href="#3" id="3">It is also a corollary of the recent and more complex Theorem 3.1 in [17].Suppose we have an algorithm A that generates a solution to a GIC constraint network N in time bounded by a polynomial {a mathematical formula}p(|N|).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, as 3Col is NP-complete, there cannot exist a polynomial algorithm for generating a solution to a GIC constraint network, unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus {a mathematical formula}(x,a) is not GIC.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus {a mathematical formula}(x,a) is not GIC.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus {a mathematical formula}(x,a) is not GIC.Completeness.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, values in {a mathematical formula}gicValues[x] are GIC.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The only place where a variable is removed from {a mathematical formula}Ssup is line 5 of Algorithm 5.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">If {a mathematical formula}(x,a) has been deleted (at level {a mathematical formula}j − 1) by GAC after decision {a mathematical formula} Δ j, we know that GIC will prune {a mathematical formula}(x,a) at level {a mathematical formula}j − 1 at the very last.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The interval of {a mathematical formula}(x,a) in Unk is modified in line 7 only if GAC has removed {a mathematical formula}(x,a) after decision {a mathematical formula} Δ j has been applied.</a>
