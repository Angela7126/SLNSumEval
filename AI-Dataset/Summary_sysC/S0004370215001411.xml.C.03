<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}Vt and state s is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is, an SSP MDP-IP is an extension of an SSP MDP where, instead of a probability distribution {a mathematical formula}P( ⋅ |s,a) over the state space S, there is a set of probability distributions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For instance, consider an SSP MDP-IP with four states and two actions, {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}a2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A credal set containing conditional probability distributions over the next state {a mathematical formula}s ′ , given a state s and an action a, is referred to as a transition credal set[17] and denoted by {a mathematical formula}K( ⋅ |s,a).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In practice, Value Iteration for SSP MDP-IPs is stopped when:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}S ′ is the set of states reachable from {a mathematical formula}s0 under some greedy policy Π w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A factored SSP MDP-IP is an SSP MDP-IP where states {a mathematical formula}x → are specified as a joint assignment to a vector {a mathematical formula}X → of n state variables {a mathematical formula}(X1, … ,Xn) and where the dynamic credal networks (DCNs)[17], [18], [23] are used to represent the transition function.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}xi is used to represent the value assignment of the state variable {a mathematical formula}Xi.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">E.g., for {a mathematical formula}n=3, the abstract state {a mathematical formula}w → ={X1=1,X2=0} corresponds to the set of states {a mathematical formula}{{X1=1,X2=0,X3=0},{X1=1,X2=0,X3=1}}.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Factored SSP MDP-IPFormally a Factored SSP MDP-IP is defined by {a mathematical formula} 〈 X → ,A,C,K,G,x → 0 〉 where A is defined as for any SSP MDP-IP, {a mathematical formula}X → is a vector of n state variables {a mathematical formula}(X1, … ,Xn), C is a factored cost function, {a mathematical formula}K is a set of factored transition credal sets (Definition 4.2), G is a set of goal states and {a mathematical formula}x → 0 the initial state.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, {a mathematical formula}p → can be used for both purposes, i.e., to update a state value and to sample the next state.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">15 for the currently visited state {a mathematical formula}x → ={X1=1,X2=1} and action a.</a>
