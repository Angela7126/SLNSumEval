<a href="#0" id="0">If l is on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}tl, l can obviously be interpreted as true and Lemma 7 is supported.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Otherwise, l and also {a mathematical formula}tl is on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}s9 or {a mathematical formula}s10.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Without any loss of generality, we can interpret l as true also in such a case.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The reason is that another literal sensor representing the complementary literal {a mathematical formula}l ‾ can never be on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}tl.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, bringing such a solution graph structure into the canonical form, in which l and {a mathematical formula}tl are collocated, is always possible with a single switch of sensors and no further side effects.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence, Lemma 7 is supported.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}Solution for PUDP3,2 ⇒ Solution for 3-SAT:_ In a PUDP3,2 input graph, the incorporated 3-clause input structures enforce that with respect to each 3-clause at least one literal represented by a literal sensor evaluates to true (Lemma 7).</a>
