<a href="#0" id="0">According to the semantics of these axioms, it is easy to see that dual-Horn KBs are not more expressive than core ones: a dual-Horn axiom {a mathematical formula}p → q1 ∧ … ∧ qn can be expressed by the core axioms {a mathematical formula}p → q1, … ,p → qn.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, any dual-Horn KB can be transformed into an equivalent core KB in linear time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, as we show in this paper, the complexity of pinpointing-related problems is in general higher for dual-Horn KBs than for core ones.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The main reason for this disparity is that in axiom pinpointing, all axioms in a KB are considered independently (see Definition 1 below).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, despite being logically equivalent, the dual-Horn axiom {a mathematical formula}p → q1 ∧ … ∧ qn and the set of core axioms {a mathematical formula}p → q1, … ,p → qn yield different pinpointing results.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It is not difficult to see that, for all types of axioms considered in this paper except for the {a mathematical formula}DL-Litebool family, all-minas is in conp: given an instance of all-minas, a nondeterministic algorithm can guess a subset of {a mathematical formula}K that is not in {a mathematical formula}K, and in polynomial time verify that this is a MinA, thus proving that {a mathematical formula}K is not the set of all MinAs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If {a mathematical formula}M is not the first MinA, a proof of this can be given by guessing a subset of {a mathematical formula}K and verifying in polynomial time that it is a MinA, and it is lexicographically smaller than {a mathematical formula}M. To show conp-hardness, we present a reduction from the np-hard mina-relevance problem of core KBs (see Theorem 7) to the negation of first-mina.Let {a mathematical formula}K, Φ , Ψ be an instance of mina-relevance, and let {a mathematical formula}M be an arbitrary but fixed MinA for Φ in {a mathematical formula}K. {a mathematical formula}M can be computed time polynomial on the size of {a mathematical formula}K as described in the proof of Theorem 17.</a>
