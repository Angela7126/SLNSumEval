<a href="#0" id="0">We then apply the new methodology to a number of MaxSAT problem domains and show that the resulting solvers consistently outperform the best existing solvers on the respective problem families.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A WPMS algorithm for the WPMS problem, takes as input a WPMS formula Φ and returns an assignment {a mathematical formula}I, such that, {a mathematical formula}I( Φ ) ≥ cost( Φ ).Given unlimited resources of time and memory, we say that a WPMS algorithm is complete or exact if for any input WPMS formula Φ and returned {a mathematical formula}I, {a mathematical formula}I( Φ )=cost( Φ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The split feature and value are chosen such that the cumulative performance when solving all training instances in each partition with the same solver is minimized.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This clustering methodology assumes a good cluster to be Gaussian distributed, and iteratively splits clusters in two until they all pass the Anderson – Darling statistic, a statistical test for “ Gaussianness. ” Robust parameter sets are obtained by not allowing clusters to contain fewer than a manually chosen threshold, a value which depends on the size of the dataset.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In fact, when analyzing MaxSAT Evaluation results in greater detail, we find that our method generated parameterizations that no other solver could solve before, within the competition settings.</a>
