<a href="#0" id="0">Thus, a meaningful semantic description is obtained in terms of human motions and object properties.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, we propose a method that automatically identifies the semantics of human behaviors, which involves finding meaningful relationships between human motions and object properties in order to understand the activity performed by humans, i.e., the semantic representations are used to interpret a visual input to understand human activities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to define meaningful relationships between activities and objects, we use the semantic rules obtained as described in the previous Section 4.1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, if we take the sandwich scenario and we assume the perception module recognizes the hand motion m = tool_use and a new object pepper with the object property {a mathematical formula}oh(t), then for this example, our system will fail to infer the human behavior because the object pepper was not defined.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Using this equivalent state {a mathematical formula}si, our system can correctly infer the human activity using the corresponding predicate from the reasoning engine.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, we obtained the tree {a mathematical formula}Tsandwich shown at the top of Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, using the tree obtained, we can determine six hypotheses {a mathematical formula}(Hsandwich), which represent semantic rules that describes the basic human activities.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, the semantic rules obtained from the tree {a mathematical formula}Tsandwich generalized the human activities very well for the sandwich scenario.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The next challenge was to test the semantic rules in unknown scenarios, where we used the set of hypotheses {a mathematical formula}Hsandwich to infer human activities in new situations, and thus we did not generate new hypotheses to infer human basic activities.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These results indicate that the tree obtained, {a mathematical formula}Tsandwich, could generalize the definition of human basic activities in kitchen scenarios.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The previous results were obtained using the label information when one human performed different activities with the right hand.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The results obtained after testing human activities performed by both hands demonstrated our comprehensive approach.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In the next step, we tested the information obtained from module 1 (see Section 7.1), i.e., from the automatic segmentation of human motions and object properties.</a>
