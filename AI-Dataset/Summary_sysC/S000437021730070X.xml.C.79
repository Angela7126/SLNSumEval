<a href="#0" id="0">Simply enough, in the progressional definition, a first-order structure {a mathematical formula}M is a stable model of a first-order normal logic program Π if and only if it is the fixed point of the progression of Π with respect to {a mathematical formula}M. More precisely, {a mathematical formula}M coincides with the structure obtained by recursively applying the rules in Π , where the negative parts are fixed by {a mathematical formula}M itself.</a>

<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ be a new predicate that has the same arity as P. Let {a mathematical formula} Ψ ( Π ,P ⁎ ) be the first-order formula obtained from Π and {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ by two steps: (1) construct a program {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ by replacing every occurrence of {a mathematical formula}P(t → ) in the negative bodies of any rules in Π with {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ (t → ), (2) let {a mathematical formula} Ψ ( Π ,P ⁎ ) be the formula {a mathematical formula} ⋁ r ∈ Π ⁎ ∃ y → Body(r) ˆ , where {a mathematical formula}y → is the set of local variables in rule r. Clearly, {a mathematical formula} Ψ ( Π ,P ⁎ ) is a first-order formula of the vocabulary {a mathematical formula} Τ ( Π ) ∪ {P ⁎ }, where P only occurs positively and {a mathematical formula}x → are all the free variables.</a>
