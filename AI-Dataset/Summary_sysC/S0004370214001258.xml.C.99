<a href="#0" id="0">The actual value of ACO2 does not influence the most probable value of the observable variables in the network, i.e., {a mathematical formula}argmaxhPr(h,e,i,ACO2=high)=argmaxhPr(h,e,i,ACO2=mid)=argmaxhPr(h,e,i,ACO2=low) for every joint value assignment i to the intermediate variables other than ACO2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Instance: A Bayesian network {a mathematical formula}B, partitioned into a set of observed evidence variables E, a set of explanation variables H, a set of ‘ relevant ’ intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I+ that are marginalized over, and a set of ‘ irrelevant ’ intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I − that are not marginalized over.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The relevance of I, denoted as {a mathematical formula}R(I), is the fraction of joint value assignments i in {a mathematical formula} Ω (I ∖ {I}) for which {a mathematical formula}argmaxhPr(h,e,i,i) is not identical for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ Ω (I).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As computing the relevance of a variable I is {a mathematical formula}NP-hard, i.e., intractable in general (see Appendix A for a formal proof), we introduce the notion estimated relevance of I as a subjective assessment of {a mathematical formula}R(I) which may or may not correspond to the actual value.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that both intrinsic and estimated relevance of a variable are relative to a particular set of candidate explanations H, and conditional on a particular observation, i.e., a value assignment e to the evidence nodes E.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Instance: A Bayesian network {a mathematical formula}B=(GB,Pr), where V is partitioned into a set of evidence nodes E with a joint value assign-ment e, an explanation set H, a set of relevant intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I+, and a set of irrelevant intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I − ; a rational number {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ q<1 and an integer {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ k<| Ω (I − )|.</a>
