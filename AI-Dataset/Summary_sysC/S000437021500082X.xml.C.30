<a href="#0" id="0">This paper investigates the strengths of a transfer learning meta-algorithm, called L3, that provides a framework that allows the implementation of different algorithms using heuristics to accelerate a Reinforcement Learning procedure in one domain (target), that are obtained from another, simpler, domain (source).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The L3 meta-algorithm works in 3 stages: first, it uses an RL algorithm to learn how to perform one task, storing the solution for this problem as a case in a case base; in the second stage, it maps actions of the source domain to actions of the target domain; and, in the last stage, it uses the stored cases as heuristics to speed up the Reinforcement Learning process in the target domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By using a case base as part of the transfer learning procedure, L3 falls within the class of case-based transfer learning algorithms, discussed in [12].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A preliminary investigation on this meta-algorithm was presented in [13], where an L3 instance based on the Q-Learning algorithm was described.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The present paper extends our previous work in three ways: first, this work introduces a new L3 algorithm based on the SARSA( Λ ) algorithm; second, the proposed algorithms are evaluated on more domains than those described in [13]; and, third, we show that the L3 framework is robust under the transference of negative information.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The case base used in L3-SARSA( Λ ) was the one that contains N cases selected by random sampling the state set and finding the best action for that state, because this is the case base that produced the best results for the transfer.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In order to decide which case base should be used in the transfer, from the three possibilities acquired (as mentioned above), we compared the results of using each case base with the L3-SARSA( Λ ) algorithm in the target domain.</a>
