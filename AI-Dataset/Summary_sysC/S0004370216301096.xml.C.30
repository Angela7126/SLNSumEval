<a href="#0" id="0">Consider six agents with the following utilities over the items from the set {a mathematical formula}A={a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6}:{a mathematical formula} Note that Agents 1, 2, and 3 have the same utilities for all the items.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The utilities of the agents from Example 1 are Borda-based and can be expressed as the following preference orders:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However there are also other natural cases of non-finicky utilities.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, consider agents that have approval-based utilities and where each agent approves of at least a Γ fraction of the items.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These agents have {a mathematical formula}(1, Γ )-non-finicky utilities.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">(The reader may be surprised here that approval-based utilities may be non-finicky even though we said that we obtain inapproximability results for them.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, without restrictions on the agents' utilities, OWA-Winner can be solved in polynomial time either if we treat K as a constant or if we use the constant OWA vector (i.e., if we use {a mathematical formula}K-best OWA).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Indeed, the problem becomes NP-hard already for the {a mathematical formula}(K − 1)-best OWA.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This holds even if the agents are restricted to have approval-based utilities (Theorem 6) or Borda-based utilities (Theorem 7).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}(K − 1)-best-OWA-Winneris NP-hard even for Borda-based utilities.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It is easy to note that for K-best OWA (that is, for the family of constant OWAs {a mathematical formula} Α =(1, … ,1)) the problem is in P.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Based on the above result, we can easily show that Algorithm 1 is a polynomial time {a mathematical formula}(1 − 1/e)-approximation for the OWA-Winner problem, for the case of nonincreasing OWA vectors (see Theorem 13 below).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Algorithm 1 is a natural incarnation of the greedy algorithm of Nemhauser et al.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For a nonincreasing OWA Α ,Algorithm 1is a polynomial time{a mathematical formula}(1 − 1/e)-approximation algorithm for the problem of finding the utilitarian set of K winners.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">(1) There is an algorithm that for{a mathematical formula}Hurwicz[ Λ ]-OWA-Winnerwith no restrictions on the utility functions achieves approximation ratio{a mathematical formula} Λ (1 − 1e).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">(2) For each positive Ε , there is an algorithm that for{a mathematical formula}Hurwicz[ Λ ]-OWA-Winnerfor the case of Borda-based utilities achieves approximation ration{a mathematical formula} Λ (1 − Ε ).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Fix a positive integer ℓ and let Α be a nonincreasing OWA where at most first ℓ entries are nonzero.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">If the agents have{a mathematical formula}( Β , Γ )-non-finicky utilities, with{a mathematical formula} Γ m ≥ ℓ , thenAlgorithm 2is a polynomial-time{a mathematical formula} Β (1 − exp ⁡ ( − Γ K ℓ ))-approximation algorithm for Α -OWA-Winner.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The next corollary follows directly from Theorem 25 by noting that in the case of m items and k-approval utilities (i.e., for the case where each agent approves of exactly k items) we have {a mathematical formula}(1,km)-non-finicky utilities.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Fix a positive integer ℓ and let Α be a nonincreasing OWA where at most first ℓ entries are nonzero.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Assume the k-approval utilities of the agents.Algorithm 2is a{a mathematical formula}(1 − exp ⁡ ( − kK ℓ m))-approximation algorithm for Α -OWA-Winner.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Fix a positive integer ℓ and let Α be a family of OWAs that have nonzero entries on top ℓ positions only.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">There is a polynomial-time{a mathematical formula} Β (1 − ℓ exp ⁡ ( − Γ K ℓ 2)) – approximation algorithm for Α -OWA-Winnerfor the case of{a mathematical formula}( Β , Γ ) – non-finicky utilities.</a>
