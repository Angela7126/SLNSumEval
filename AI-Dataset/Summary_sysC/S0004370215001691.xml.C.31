<a href="#1" id="1">In the following definition, we introduce a particular type of preference relations, called Δ -preference relations, that allows us to introduce a general algorithm for computing Top-k models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let Φ be a CNF formula and ⪰ a preference relation on the models of Φ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then ⪰ is a Δ -preference relation, if there exists a function {a mathematical formula} Δ ⪰ Φ from {a mathematical formula} Λ Φ to the set of CNF formulae, called bound function, such that (i) it is polynomially computable in the size of Φ and (ii) for all {a mathematical formula}M ∈ Λ Φ , {a mathematical formula}M ′ is a model of {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ Δ ⪰ Φ (M) iff {a mathematical formula}M ′ is a model of Φ and {a mathematical formula}M ⊁ M ′ , for every Boolean interpretation {a mathematical formula}M ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this context, computing the Top-k closed itemsets of length at least min corresponds to computing the Top-k models of {a mathematical formula} Φ ≡ (1) ∧ (2) ∧ (3) with respect to {a mathematical formula} ⪰ B and {a mathematical formula}X={pa|a ∈ I}, where {a mathematical formula}B={b0, … ,bn − 1} and {a mathematical formula} ⪰ B is defined as follows: {a mathematical formula}M ⪰ BM ′ if and only if {a mathematical formula}|M(B)| ≤ |M ′ (B)|.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This preference relation means that a model {a mathematical formula}M is more preferred than a model {a mathematical formula}M ′ if the itemset {a mathematical formula}{a ∈ I|M(pa)=1} is more frequent than {a mathematical formula}{a ∈ I|M ′ (pa)=1}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It is a Δ -preference relation since one can define the bound function {a mathematical formula} Δ ⪰ B Φ as follows:{a mathematical formula} Indeed, this formula allows us to have models corresponding to closed itemsets with supports greater than or equal to the support of the closed itemset obtained from {a mathematical formula}M.</a>
