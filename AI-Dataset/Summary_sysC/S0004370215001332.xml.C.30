<a href="#0" id="0">We use AI planning as a general framework to tackle the temporal voltage control problem in an active distribution network.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Section 2 motivates our problem and highlights our contributions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Section 3 discusses related methods for managing AC power flow, explored in the literature.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Section 4 defines a new class of metric temporal problems representing one dimension of the AC voltage control problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Section 5 we present the necessary fundamentals of power systems, with emphasis on the voltage control problem for distribution systems.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This leads to the identification of a second dimension to our problem, and motivates the need for attachment to an external solver which is then described in Section 6.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In Section 6 we also describe our (extended) pddl model of the AC voltage control problem.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Section 7 describes our approach to solving the two dimensions of the problem.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The AC voltage control problem is one aspect of the autonomous management of an electricity network.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In addressing this problem we face new issues for planning.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The AC voltage control domain is also characterised by the presence of trajectory constraints, since the voltages at all of the network busbars must be maintained within a safe range over the entire period of the plan.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The voltage trajectory constraint holds over the whole plan, while other constraints, such as thermal constraints, must generally be maintained, but may be relaxed over windows of time during the plan.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In the AC voltage control domain, the behaviours of the numeric quantities are affected by every single element of the network.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This implies that every time we change a parameter of the network, the numeric effects propagate all over the system.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A simple example of a BTMP is the following Simple Voltage problem.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In this domain, the voltage in some system must be maintained between upper and lower bounds, over a time period.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">During the period, there are a number of TIFs representing an uncontrollable discretised background voltage curve.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The controllable part of the system voltage can be managed using actions.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The mixed metric constraints in this problem are:{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The AC voltage control problem is concerned with maintaining the voltage at each busbar of a distribution network (or a zone of the network) within a given bound, for an extended period of time, assuming that the load profile of consumers and the schedule of the power system generators are known over this period.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Given background load and generation profiles over the period, and safety constraints on maximum and minimum voltages, the planning problem is to manipulate network components, such as transformers, in time to interact with background profiles in such a way that the voltages at the busbars of the network always remain within their specified safety bounds.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">We now have the elements of a BTMP (Definition 5), because the voltage is a function of both the controllable and uncontrollable metric fluents, and hence is a mixed metric expression.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">All of the metric fluents in the problem are controllable or uncontrollable.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We have an always trajectory constraint as specified in Definition 5.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Therefore the AC voltage control problem is a BTMP.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">For the baseline heuristic evaluation, the relaxation of numeric state variables used in popf-tif is based on the same principle introduced in Metric-FF [31] of relaxing the decreasing effects on numeric fluents.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The reachable values of the {a mathematical formula}Vspecial variables are not accessible to the planner, so in order to obtain any heuristic information from the external solver, the planner requires a relaxation of the Network encapsulated type.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Since the over all constraint, in the constraint-check action, refers to the Network voltage, the computation of {a mathematical formula}P[v/ Î‘ ] (Definition 11) exploits the external solver to determine the actual value of the Network voltage for the particular p-level and q-level load and generation settings.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">That is, when P is a condition on a {a mathematical formula}Vspecial variable, the external solver must compute the new value of the variable using the newly TIF-assigned {a mathematical formula}Vdep values, then evaluate P for the particular instance of the encapsulated type.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">In case (a) the heuristic contains no information about the effects of actions or TIFs on the voltage.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">The computation of the voltage at each node of the network, for specified loads and generation configurations, is called the power flow (or load flow) problem.</a>
