<a href="#0" id="0">However, if no guidance is provided to the teacher, he may demonstrate an action that is already known by the system.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the model, the actions are represented as a set of action rules, which can be applied over a state space.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, we propose the use of a rule analysis approach to provide some guidance to the teacher so he can demonstrate the unknown parts needed by the decision maker.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In summary, we propose a RL algorithm that can request demonstrations from a teacher whenever it requires new unknown actions to complete a task, which significantly reduces the number of experiences required to learn.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula} Φ r( Χ ) are the preconditions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When the action {a mathematical formula}ar is executed, only the rule r with preconditions present in the state will be applicable.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our environment contains a robot, which can perform different actions, a perception system to obtain the state, and a human teacher who can demonstrate actions to the robot when requested.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The robot starts with no previous knowledge of the transition function T or the set of available actions A.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">When new goals are assigned to the robot, it tries to solve the tasks and it requests demonstrations if they were needed.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">When the current state is known (using only the list of actions that have already been learned) and no plan is found, a demonstration is requested by REX-D.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The teacher will execute the best action for that state, which may be a new and previously unlearned action.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The REX-D algorithm requests demonstrations from the teacher whenever it does not know how to complete the task.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">However, several actions may be required to complete the task, only one of which might be unknown to the system.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Thus, if no guidance is provided, the teacher may demonstrate actions that the system already knows before demonstrating the action that is actually required.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Our objective is to avoid these unnecessary demonstrations, thereby minimizing the number of interactions with the teacher.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Each time the task was changed, after executing a few actions, the system realized that it needed a new action and requested a demonstration from the teacher.</a>
