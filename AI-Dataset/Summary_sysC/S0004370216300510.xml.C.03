<a href="#0" id="0">The list of crossings for the string Str corresponds to {a mathematical formula}chain(Str)=[Sphere1+,PostH+,Sphere2+].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The execution of {a mathematical formula}pass(o,f) could affect the string crossings in the cases where o was a string tip or a holed object.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, state {a mathematical formula}S1 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">8 where string s has both tips free with the corresponding {a mathematical formula}chain(s)=[sb − ,se+].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this case, the string has {a mathematical formula}chain(s)=[sb − ,sb+] and ends up forming a (closed) single loop {a mathematical formula}l(s,sb − ,[0,1])={(s:0)}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The inclusion of loops inside larger loops is well illustrated by state {a mathematical formula}S2 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If {a mathematical formula}pass(se,h+) is executed, we would get {a mathematical formula}chain(s)=[sb − ,h+,se+] depicted as state 1 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">To sum up, we define two new actions, {a mathematical formula}pick(s:i,f) and {a mathematical formula}pull(s:i,f), that respectively allow picking or pulling some string segment {a mathematical formula}s:i toward a hole face f. The direct effects of these two actions are represented in Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As happens with passing a tip, the action {a mathematical formula}pick is not symmetric: if we execute {a mathematical formula}pick(s:i,f) on the left state of Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">12 shows how {a mathematical formula}pull(s:i,f) picks string t (dashed) that was crossing the removed loop {a mathematical formula}s:i.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To illustrate the second kind of indirect effect associated to {a mathematical formula}pull, consider again Fig.</a>
