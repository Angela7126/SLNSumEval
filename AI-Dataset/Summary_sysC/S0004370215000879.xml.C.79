<a href="#1" id="1">It is an interesting open question whether it is possible to derive an auction-dependent bound where the specific values of the cumulative probabilities of observation {a mathematical formula} Γ m,i explicitly appear in the bound and which reduces to Eq.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While the proof of Theorem 2 could exploit the specific definition of the payments for position-dependent slots and it is a fairly simple extension of [20], in this case the proof is more complicated because of the dependency of the cumulative probabilities of observation on the actual allocations and decomposes the regret of the exploitation phase in components due to the different allocations ({a mathematical formula}f ˜ instead of {a mathematical formula}f ⁎ ) and the different qualities as well ({a mathematical formula}q ˜ i+ instead of {a mathematical formula}qi).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{sup:17} In particular, the theoretical bounds reveal the dependency of (expected) regret on characteristic parameters of the auction (i.e., T, N, K, and {a mathematical formula}qmin, and Μ if the mechanism is randomized).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since the main objective is to evaluate the asymptotic accuracy of the bounds, we report the relative regret{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}B(T,K,N,qmin) is the value of the bound for the specific setting (i.e., Eq.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Upper-bounds over this quantity guarantees that the loss in terms of revenue does not increase linearly with T. As illustrated in the previous sections, the key passage in the proofs is the upper-bounding of the regret at each step of the exploitation phase (i.e., {a mathematical formula}r= ∑ i=1N(pi ⁎ (v) − p ˜ i(v))).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">First we notice that adopting the value of the parameters identified in Theorem 2 we obtain an upper bound {a mathematical formula}O ˜ (T23) for the global regret {a mathematical formula}RTSW.In order to find values that better optimize the bound over {a mathematical formula}RTSW, let {a mathematical formula}e:=1 Λ min, then we first simplify the previous bound as{a mathematical formula} Taking the derivative of the previous bound w.r.t.</a>

<a href="#8" id="8">We start computing the per-step regret over the SW during the exploitation phase.First of all we introduce the following definition: {a mathematical formula}S ′ ={s ′ |s ′ ∈ {0,1}N, Π (i;f ⁎ (v ˆ )) ≤ K ⇒ si ′ =1}, i.e., the set of the random realization where the cSRP does not modify the bids of the ads displayed when the allocation function is {a mathematical formula}f ⁎ is applied to the true bids {a mathematical formula}v ˆ .We now provide the bound over the regret.</a>
