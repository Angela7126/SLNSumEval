<a href="#0" id="0">The increasing use of group discounts has provided opportunities for buying groups with diverse preferences to coordinate their behavior in order to exploit the best offers from multiple vendors.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We analyze this problem from the viewpoint of the vendors, asking under what conditions a vendor should adopt a volume-based price schedule rather than posting a fixed price.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We consider both the case of monopolist vendors and cases where a vendor competes with other vendors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Vendors and buyers engage as follows: in the first stage of the game, each vendor posts a discount schedule, a non-increasing vector {a mathematical formula}pj:[n] → R+, where {a mathematical formula}pj(t) is the price offered if t buyers each purchase j's item [1].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}P be the set of all possible discount schedules and {a mathematical formula}P=(p1, … ,pm) a profile of schedules, one per vendor.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We refer to a schedule with a single fixed price as a trivial schedule, which for simplicity is denoted by {a mathematical formula}pj ∈ R+.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Assume a profile of discount schedules P has been fixed by the vendors.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Once buyers are assigned to specific vendors, the item prices are set by {a mathematical formula}(P,S) as defined above.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Buyer utility is quasi-linear in price: the utility of {a mathematical formula}i ∈ Sj is {a mathematical formula}ui(P,S)=vij − pj(|Sj|).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For ease of exposition we assume buyers are never indifferent between products (vendors); as such, we assume a predetermined ordering of vendors, specific to each buyer, that is part of its type {a mathematical formula}Vi.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This is used to break ties between vendors for whom the buyer otherwise has the same utility.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Proof</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As it turns out, the full information model is not especially interesting from our perspective.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In the full information model, there is always a fixed price{a mathematical formula}pjthat is a best response for vendor j to any strategy profile{a mathematical formula}P − jof the other vendors.If the vendors have full information, then they know exactly which buyer partitions will form given any profile of discounts P. Suppose that vendor j expects to have t buyers under some nontrivial schedule {a mathematical formula}pj.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">That is, {a mathematical formula}|Sj|=t, where {a mathematical formula}S=S((p − j,pj),V).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Then j can post a fixed price {a mathematical formula}pj=pj(t) and induce identical buyer behavior S.Let {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ =(p − j,pj).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">To see why S is still an SBP, assume toward a contradiction that some buyer i has a deviation from {a mathematical formula}Sk to {a mathematical formula}Sk ′ under prices {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">First, {a mathematical formula}pk(|Sk|)=pk ⁎ (|Sk|).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">If {a mathematical formula}k ′ ≠ j, then {a mathematical formula}pk ′ (|Sk ′ ∪ {i}|)=pk ′ ⁎ (|Sk ′ ∪ {i}|).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">If {a mathematical formula}k ′ =j, then{a mathematical formula} In either case, buyer i would also deviate under prices P, which is a contradiction.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">One reason for posting volume discounts rather than fixed prices is to hedge against uncertainty regarding the preferences (hence decisions) of the buyers.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Specifically, a vendor can “ insure ” itself against the possibility that fewer buyers are attracted to its product than expected by using volume discounts.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In the Bayesian model we assume that there is some joint distribution over buyers' types {a mathematical formula}D=D(A) which is common knowledge among vendors.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The game takes the form {a mathematical formula}G= 〈 D,C 〉 .</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">In the first stage of the game, vendors choose discount schedules, not knowing the buyers' types.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">In the second stage, a type matrix {a mathematical formula}V=(vij)i ∈ N,j ∈ M is drawn from {a mathematical formula}D. The goal of vendor j is to set a schedule {a mathematical formula}pj that maximizes its expected utility:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">First consider the case of a single vendor: suppose a monopolist is faced with distribution {a mathematical formula}D over buyer types.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The simple example below demonstrates that a vendor can strictly increase its revenue, relative to any fixed price, using a non-trivial discount schedule.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Assume two buyers, and a (discrete) type distribution that assigns probability 0.5 to each of two type matrices, {a mathematical formula}(2,2) and {a mathematical formula}(3,0).</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Note that buyers' valuations are correlated in {a mathematical formula}D. The optimal fixed price is {a mathematical formula}p=2, which guarantees revenue {a mathematical formula}U(p,D)=0.5 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2+0.5 ⋅ 2=3 (two buyers in the first realization and one in the second).</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">However, consider a discount schedule with a base price {a mathematical formula}p(1)=3, and a discounted price {a mathematical formula}p(2)=2.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Its expected revenue, {a mathematical formula}U(p,D)=0.5 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2+0.5 ⋅ 3=3.5, is greater than that of the optimal fixed price.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">More detailed examples are given in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Proposition 2</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">By contrast, if buyer valuations are i.i.d., the monopolist is always at least as well off using a fixed price: Consider a single vendor facing n i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">buyers with distribution{a mathematical formula}D. Let{a mathematical formula}p ⁎ be the optimal fixed price for the vendor.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">For any discount schedulep,{a mathematical formula}U(p,D) ≤ U(p ⁎ ,D).</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Proof</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">We now consider the best response of a vendor to the offers of other vendors.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Suppose vendors other than j post discount schedules {a mathematical formula}p − j.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">The best response of j is:{a mathematical formula} Our main result in the Bayesian model is that, assuming buyer types are independent and drawn from the same distribution, a vendor cannot benefit by using a discount schedule instead of a fixed price unless other vendors also use schedules.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Below we show that these conditions are minimal: a non-trivial schedule can be of value if any of these three conditions is relaxed.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Let{a mathematical formula}G= 〈 D,C 〉 be a game with i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">buyers, which always select an undominated SBP.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">If all vendors except j post fixed prices, then there is a best response for vendor j that is also a fixed price.W.l.o.g., we analyze the response of vendor 1 to fixed prices of the other vendors.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Denote by {a mathematical formula}q2, … ,qm the (fixed) prices of all other vendors.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Given distribution {a mathematical formula}D ˆ over a single buyer's types (a distribution over vectors of size m), we define the following single parameter distribution {a mathematical formula}D ˆ ′ :{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} ≳ j should be interpreted as > if a buyer of type v prefers vendor j over 1 in case of a tie, and otherwise as ≥ .</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">{sup:4} For instance, in the special case where the buyer always prefers vendor 1, we have {a mathematical formula}Prv ∼ D ˆ ′ (v ≥ x) ≡ Prv ∼ D ˆ (v1 − max2 ≤ j ≤ m ⁡ (vj − qj) ≥ x).Now, consider vendor 1 to be a monopoly, facing buyers that are sampled from distribution {a mathematical formula}D ′ (or, equivalently, each buyer is i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">sampled from {a mathematical formula}D ˆ ′ ).</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">An indifferent buyer (with {a mathematical formula}v=p) always chooses to buy a product from vendor 1 over abstaining from purchase.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">The vendor can attract k buyers at price p iff there are k buyers for which {a mathematical formula}vi,1 ≥ p.</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">However, for every buyer i,{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} That is, vendor 1, when viewed as a monopolist, will attract the same set of buyers at the same price as in the multi-vendor game.</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">Thus the revenue of any discount schedule p for the single vendor under distribution {a mathematical formula}D ′ is equal to the revenue it derives using p when faced with vendors posting prices {a mathematical formula}q2, … ,qm under distribution {a mathematical formula}D. One subtle issue is that given pricing {a mathematical formula}p1=p in the multi-vendor game G, there may be several SBPs.</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">However, the stable partition that extracts the best price (i.e., the one where the largest number of buyers select vendor 1, and is also stable) Pareto dominates all other SBPs.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">Thus according to the undominated SBP assumption {a mathematical formula}S((p1,q2, … ,qm),V) is uniquely defined, and {a mathematical formula}S1 coincides with the set of buyers that purchase in the single vendor setting.Finally, by Proposition 2, the best strategy for the vendor is to post a fixed price {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ , which entails that {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ =brjEU(q2, … ,qm).</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">Lastly, we describe a game with two i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">buyers, maintaining conditions (a) and (b), but where the best response for vendor 1 to a discount schedule posted by vendor 2 is itself a schedule (the full analysis of this example appears in Appendix B).</a>
<a href="#57" id="57">Let {a mathematical formula}va1=vb1=10, {a mathematical formula}va2=10+xa, and {a mathematical formula}vb2=10+xb, where {a mathematical formula}xa and {a mathematical formula}xb are sampled i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#58" id="58">from {a mathematical formula}D=U[ − 1,1].</a>
<a href="#59" id="59">As long as prices are not too high (say, below 8) buyer i's decision is determined only by the value difference {a mathematical formula}xi between her value for the two vendors.</a>
<a href="#60" id="60">It is not hard to verify that the best response of every vendor j to the fixed price {a mathematical formula}p − j=1 is {a mathematical formula}pj=1, even if schedules are allowed (i.e., {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1) is an equilibrium, see Section 6.1).</a>
<a href="#61" id="61">However, suppose vendor 2 posts schedule {a mathematical formula}q=(1,0.8).</a>
<a href="#62" id="62">Vendor 1's best response is not a fixed price: it can be shown that its optimal fixed price is {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ ≅ 0.922, yielding revenue of 0.93656, while the schedule {a mathematical formula}(0.93,0.914) yields slightly higher revenue of 0.93675.</a>
<a href="#63" id="63">Once vendors select strategies (prices) P, suppose that the realized buyer types are given by V. This results in the buyer partition {a mathematical formula}S=S(P,V).</a>
<a href="#64" id="64">We define the regret{a mathematical formula}Regj(P,V) of vendor j relative to this outcome to be the difference between the maximum utility it could have achieved by choosing different prices given this type realization (taking other vendor strategies to be fixed) and its utility given its selected strategy:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}P ′ =(pj ′ ,p − j).</a>
<a href="#65" id="65">Note that w.l.o.g.</a>
<a href="#66" id="66">the optimal schedule {a mathematical formula}pj ′ can be taken to be a fixed price (by Proposition 1).</a>
