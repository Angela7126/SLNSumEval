<a href="#0" id="0">The method we apply to obtain these solvers is a portfolio tuning approach ISAC++ which generalizes both tuning of individual solvers as well as combining multiple solvers into one solver portfolio.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a side-effect of our work on MaxSAT, we found a way to improve instance-specific algorithm configuration (ISAC) [28] by combining the original methodology with one of the latest and most efficient algorithm portfolio builders to date.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A WPMS algorithm for the WPMS problem, takes as input a WPMS formula Φ and returns an assignment {a mathematical formula}I, such that, {a mathematical formula}I( Φ ) ≥ cost( Φ ).Given unlimited resources of time and memory, we say that a WPMS algorithm is complete or exact if for any input WPMS formula Φ and returned {a mathematical formula}I, {a mathematical formula}I( Φ )=cost( Φ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As we aim to tackle the variety of existing MaxSAT problems, we should not rely directly on the instance features used in [40] which considered instances where all clauses are soft with identical weights.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We therefore compute the percentage of clauses that are soft, and the statistics of the distribution of weights: mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation.</a>
