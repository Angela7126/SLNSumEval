<a href="#1" id="1">We show by induction that {a mathematical formula}set( Α ) ⊆ bet Σ ̲ (set( Β ),set( Γ )).If {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Α → Β ⋈ Σ Γ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet ̲ 1), then Α , Β and Γ are atoms and we have that {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ̲ ( Β , Α , Γ ) ∈ Σ , from which we find using (39) that {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ̲ (reg( Β ),reg( Α ),reg( Γ )) holds which is the same as {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ̲ (set( Β ),set( Α ),set( Γ )) because Α , Β and Γ are atoms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We then easily find that {a mathematical formula}set( Α ) ⊆ bet Σ ̲ (set( Β ),set( Γ )).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Indeed, applying the definition of {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ̲ , given by (28), all attribute domains except for the one in which Α , Β and Γ occur are deemed irrelevant, in which case {a mathematical formula}bet Σ ̲ (set( Β ),set( Γ )) reduces to betweenness at the atom level.If {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Α → Β ⋈ Σ Γ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet ̲ 2), then there exist {a mathematical formula} Α ′ , {a mathematical formula} Β ′ , {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ such that {a mathematical formula} Α ⊨ A Α ′ , {a mathematical formula} Β ′ ⊨ A Β and {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ ⊨ A Γ , {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Α ′ → Β ′ ⋈ Σ ′ Γ ′ , and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ ⊆ Σ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By induction, we then have that {a mathematical formula}set( Α ′ ) ⊆ bet Σ ′ ̲ (set( Β ′ ),set( Γ ′ )), while we have {a mathematical formula}set( Α ) ⊆ set( Α ′ ), {a mathematical formula}set( Β ′ ) ⊆ set( Β ) and {a mathematical formula}set( Γ ′ ) ⊆ set( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By the fact that {a mathematical formula}bet ̲ is clearly monotonic w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">set inclusion, it follows that{a mathematical formula}In the case where {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Α → Β ⋈ Σ Γ was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(bet3 ̲ ), we already have {a mathematical formula}set( Α ) ⊆ bet1 − Σ ̲ (set( Γ ),set( Β )).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Because of {a mathematical formula}(par9 ̲ ), it is sufficient to show that {a mathematical formula}set( Δ ) ⊆ par Τ ̲ (set( Α ∧ Δ i),set( Β ∧ Δ i),set( Γ )) for each i.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since these elements from {a mathematical formula}domains( Δ ) are assumed to be orthogonal to the elements of {a mathematical formula}domains( Α ) ∪ domains( Β ) ∪ domains( Γ ) ∪ domains( Δ ), however, the latter inclusion follows easily from the definition of {a mathematical formula}par Τ ̲ , given that we already know that {a mathematical formula}set( Δ ) ⊆ par Τ ̲ (set( Α ′ ),set( Β ′ ),set( Γ )).The case where {a mathematical formula}(par11 ̲ ) is entirely analogous to the case for {a mathematical formula}(par8 ̲ ) in the proof of Proposition 9.The case where {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Δ → Γ ▷ Τ 〈 Α , Β 〉 was obtained from {a mathematical formula}(par12 ̲ ) is trivial.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Now we assume that {a mathematical formula}set( Δ ) ⊆ par Τ ̲ (set( Α ),set( Β ),set( Γ )) and show that {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊢ Δ → Γ ▷ Τ 〈 Α , Β 〉 can be derived from the inference rules {a mathematical formula}(par1 ̲ ) – {a mathematical formula}(par ̲ 12).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">If either of Α , Β or Γ is inconsistent, then we must have that {a mathematical formula}set( Δ )= ∅ , i.e.</a>
