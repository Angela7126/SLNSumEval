<a href="#0" id="0">Full details of all of the learned behavior layers are provided in Appendix A,{sup:6} and a diagram of how all the different layered learning behaviors fit together during the course of learning can be seen in Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">GetUp_Front_Behavior and GetUp_Back_Behavior are overlapping layered learning behaviors as they contain the same parameters as the previously learned GetUp_Front_Primitive and GetUp_Back_Primitive behaviors respectively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The full kick behaviors are overlapping layered learning behaviors because they re-optimize previous learned parameters.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The above overlapping layered approach of first independently learning the walk approach and kick, and then learning the two position parameters, does better than both the sequential layered learning approach where all kick parameters are learned after freezing the approach, and the concurrent layered learning approach where both approach and kick parameters are learned simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To isolate the performance of kicking learned through an overlapping layered learning approach we disable all kicking (except for on kickoffs where we once again have a robot kick the ball as far as possible toward the opponent's goal without scoring) and used an “ always dribble ” behavior.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We applied our overlapping layered learning approach for learning behaviors to each of the available robot types.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Instead, it may be possible to learn a better policy through overlapping layered learning and CILB that is more efficient and faster to execute: a policy consisting of a new behavior that combines the previously learned walking and kicking subtask behaviors without needing to stop and stabilize the robot before kicking the ball.</a>
