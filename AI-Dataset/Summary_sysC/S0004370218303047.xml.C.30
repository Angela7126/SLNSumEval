<a href="#1" id="1">Indeed: {a mathematical formula}INF[FFFO]is{a mathematical formula}PEXP-complete with respect to many-one reductions, regardless of whether the domain is specified in unary or binary notation.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">Note that the proof of Theorem 7 is already restricted to arity 2, hence {a mathematical formula}QINF[FFFO] is {a mathematical formula}PP-complete with respect to many-one reductions when relations have bounded arity (larger than one) and the domain is given in unary notation.</a>
