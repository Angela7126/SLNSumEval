<a href="#0" id="0">Consequently, itemset mining is clearly a nice application of our new defined Top-k SAT problem.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this context, we provide a SAT encoding and we show that computing the Top-k closed itemsets of length at least min corresponds to computing the Top-k models of the obtained propositional formula.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}D be a transaction database over {a mathematical formula}I and Λ a minimum support threshold.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The frequent itemset mining problem consists in computing the following set:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Top-k modelLet Φ be a propositional formula, {a mathematical formula}M a model of Φ , ⪰ a preference relation over the models of Φ and X a set of propositional variables.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}M is a Top-k model w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">⪰ and X iff {a mathematical formula}|[P( Φ ,M, ⪰ )]X| ≤ k − 1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let s be a sequence, p a pattern and {a mathematical formula} Λ ≥ 1 a minimal support threshold, called also a quorum.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We say that p is a frequent pattern in s w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Λ if {a mathematical formula}|Ls(p)| ≥ Λ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The frequent pattern mining problem in a sequence of items ({a mathematical formula}FPS) consists in computing the set {a mathematical formula}FPS(s, Λ ) of all the frequent patterns w.r.t.</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}FCPSminkLet k and min be strictly positive integers.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The problem of mining Top-k frequent closed patterns in a sequence {a mathematical formula}FCPSmink consists in computing all closed patterns with at least min items such that, for each one, there exist no more than {a mathematical formula}k − 1 closed patterns with at least min items and with supports greater than its support.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The problem of mining Top-k frequent closed patterns in a sequence of itemsets {a mathematical formula}FCPSImink is defined in the same way as {a mathematical formula}FCPSmink.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Concerning sequence mining, we are not aware of any available tool that enumerates the Top-k frequent closed patterns with wildcards in a sequence ({a mathematical formula}FCPSmink) as described in this paper.</a>
