<a href="#0" id="0">Abstraction heuristic [12]Let Α be an abstraction with an associated abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The induced abstraction heuristic{a mathematical formula}h Α (s) is a heuristic function that returns the cost of the cheapest path from {a mathematical formula} Α (s) to {a mathematical formula}S ⋆ Α in {a mathematical formula} Θ Α .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Abstraction heuristics are admissible and consistent, since {a mathematical formula} Θ Α is a homomorphism and, thus, paths in the original state space are preserved in the abstract state space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Every abstraction Α induces an equivalence relation on {a mathematical formula}S, {a mathematical formula} ∼ Α , defined as {a mathematical formula}s ∼ Α t if and only if {a mathematical formula} Α (s)= Α (t), i.e., any two states mapped to the same abstract state are considered to be equivalent by the abstract state space.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, each abstract state {a mathematical formula}si Α may be interpreted as a set of states {a mathematical formula}Si Α such that it contains every state mapped to {a mathematical formula}si Α , i.e., {a mathematical formula}Si Α ={s| Α (s)=si Α }.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The shrinking operation (rule S) applies a function Γ that maps the abstract states to a new set of abstract states, producing a new abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α 1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">On the other hand, {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S n corresponds to the final M&S abstract state space, {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S n ≡ Α n, whose state space can be explicitly represented (assuming a suitable value of the maximum number of M&S abstract states) possibly with a great loss of information.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">All the rest of SM&S abstractions in the hierarchy, {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i,0<i ≤ n, enable the desired trade-off between {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S 0 and {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S n. Each {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i is strictly more relaxed than the previous {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i − 1, so that the size of the abstract state spaces decreases at the expense of producing less informed heuristics {a mathematical formula}h Α SM&S i − 1(s) ≥ h Α SM&S i(s).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the original state space, sets of states are represented as functions {a mathematical formula}f:S → {1,0}, in terms of binary variables {a mathematical formula}x=x1, … ,xn.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the same way, sets of abstract states in {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i= Α i ⊗ Π Υ i+1, … , Υ n are represented as characteristic functions {a mathematical formula}f:S Α SM&S i → {1,0}.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Opposite examples can be defined where the number of BDD nodes required to represent {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i(S) is exponentially larger than the number of nodes to describe S. However, the correspondence between the ADD that describes the M&S abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α 2 and the upper levels of any BDD describing a set of abstract states lets us prove some bounds on the size of BDDs describing any set of abstract states.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let Α be an M&S abstraction with relevant variables{a mathematical formula}V Α , generated with a maximum number of abstract states M. Let{a mathematical formula}SBbe a BDD describing a set of states on{a mathematical formula} Θ Α ⊗ Π V ∖ V Α using a variable order whose first/top variables correspond to{a mathematical formula}V Α .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Table 1 shows the total coverage of all the combinations of configurations of three different parameters: the abstraction selection strategy, the variable ordering employed by the BDDs (Gamer or Fast Downward ordering) and whether the perimeter is used to initialize the abstract searches ({a mathematical formula}P ) or not ({a mathematical formula}¬P ).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Note, however, that even though {a mathematical formula}¬P ignores the perimeter for the initialization of abstract searches, it uses the perimeter for other purposes such as selecting one abstraction from the hierarchy (the one in which the perimeter is reduced enough) and to return the maximum between the heuristics derived from all the searches (including the perimeter and one or more abstract searches).</a>
