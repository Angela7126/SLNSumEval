<a href="#0" id="0">The reason is that at least one of the position indicators must be on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2 or on unit A since it is not possible to have three position indicators on unit B.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the one hand, a position indicator that is on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2 can only be connected with its adjacent literal and trueness sensor that are both contained by unit B.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the other hand, for unit A there remains a single left-over unit connection such that a literal and trueness sensor adjacent to a position indicator on unit A would have to be on the same unit in order to be connected.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}Solution for PUDP3,2 ⇒ Solution for 3-SAT:_ In a PUDP3,2 input graph, the incorporated 3-clause input structures enforce that with respect to each 3-clause at least one literal represented by a literal sensor evaluates to true (Lemma 7).</a>
