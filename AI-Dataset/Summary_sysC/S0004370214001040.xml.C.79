<a href="#0" id="0">Part 1: Due to Lemma 4, {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ⊩ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ is maxispecified it follows from {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ⊩ Ψ that {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ∪ Ψ ⊣ Ψ ˆ , thus due to counter-dominance, {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ∪ Ψ ≃ Ψ ˆ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now suppose that {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ∪ Ψ ≄ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Due to the axiom of choice and the construction in Definition 6 there is then some Δ and some p such that {a mathematical formula} Ψ ⊆ Δ ⊂ Δ ∪ { Β (p)} ⊆ Ψ ˆ ∪ Ψ and {a mathematical formula} Ψ ≃ Δ and {a mathematical formula} Ψ ≄ Δ ∪ { Β (p)}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">But due to counter-dominance, amplification and the construction in Definition 6, {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∪ { Β (p)} ≃ Ψ , thus by transitivity and coupling, {a mathematical formula} Δ ∪ ( Ψ ∪ { Β (p)}) ≃ Ψ , or equivalently {a mathematical formula} Δ ∪ { Β (p)} ≃ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This contradiction shows that {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ∪ Ψ ≃ Ψ , thus by transitivity and {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ∪ Ψ ≃ Ψ ˆ we have {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ≃ Ψ , as desired.Part 2, left to right:{a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ≃ Ψ ∪ Ξ {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ≃ Ψ ∪ Ξ ˆ (part 1 and transitivity){a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ = Ψ ∪ Ξ ˆ (since {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ and {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∪ Ξ ˆ are both maxispecified){a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ⊩ Ξ Part 2, right-to-left: Let {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ ⊩ Ξ .</a>
