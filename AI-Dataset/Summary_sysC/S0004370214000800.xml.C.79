<a href="#0" id="0">In order to effectively combine the two prediction functions v and {a mathematical formula}wt at the t-trial of the online learning task, we introduce two combination weighting parameters, {a mathematical formula} Α 1,t and {a mathematical formula} Α 2,t, for the two prediction functions respectively.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To overcome the challenge of parameter selection for {a mathematical formula}Pi, in this paper, we propose an automated parameter selection technique, an Online Window Adjustment (OWA) algorithm as shown in Algorithm 5, which can automatically determine a proper value for window size parameter {a mathematical formula}Pi during the online learning process.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition, the proposed HomOTL-I and HomOTL-II algorithms achieve the best performance among all datasets, which implies that the exploiting learnt knowledge from source domain is able to boost the performance of traditional online learning algorithms, and the two kinds of weight updating methods are generally comparable.</a>
