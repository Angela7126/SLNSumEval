<a href="#0" id="0">In detail, we compare Dist with its four alternative versions, and the experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the ideas; more interestingly, all alternatives based on separation of hard and soft score have better performance than previous local search algorithms, indicating separation of hard and soft score is an essential technique and opens up a new direction for local search algorithms for PMS (and also weighted PMS).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A common variable property used in local search algorithms for weighted MaxSAT is the {a mathematical formula}score property, which is defined as the change on the total weight of satisfied clauses caused by flipping the variable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Most local search algorithms for SAT and MaxSAT problems utilize the variable property {a mathematical formula}score, which measures the increase of the number (or total weight) of satisfied clauses caused by flipping a variable x.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Previous local search algorithms for PMS also utilize the {a mathematical formula}score property to pick variables.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Previous local search algorithms for PMS utilize the score property, which can be seen as a weighted sum of hard score and soft score in the form of {a mathematical formula}A ⋅ hscore(x)+sscore(x), where A is a positive integer number.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Based on the ideas from the preceding section, we develop an efficient local search algorithm for solving PMS, which is called Dist, as it makes effective use of the Distinctions between hard and soft clauses.</a>
