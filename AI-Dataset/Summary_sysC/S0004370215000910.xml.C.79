<a href="#0" id="0">First applications of logic to the representation of legal regulations are reviewed, where the main emphasis is on representation and where the legal conclusions follow from that representation as a matter of deduction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">All these aspects of the law, i.e., its orientation to future and not fully anticipated situations, the tension between the general terms of the law and the particulars of a case, and the adversarial nature of legal procedures, make that legal reasoning goes beyond the literal meaning of the legal rules and involves appeals to precedent, principle, policy and purpose, and involves the attack as well as the construction of arguments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Classifying the facts under legal concepts involves interpretation in a broad sense, i.e., the ampliative reasoning process which, on the basis of legal sources, determines the content of legal norms and concepts (legal interpretation in a strict sense, i.e., the attribution of a meaning to a specific legal provision in cases of doubt is an aspect of that).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, when deriving legal consequences from the classified facts, the main modes of reasoning are deductive but with room for nonmonotonic techniques to deal with exceptions to rules, either statutory or based on principle and purpose, and to choose between conflicting rules on the basis of the general hierarchy of legal systems, with rules from different sources.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The reasoning forms employed in the law may thus not only depend on the nature of the issue addressed but also on the context in which the reasoning takes place.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We will first in Section 2 review uses of logic in modelling reasoning with legal rules (whether from statutes or case law), assuming that the facts of a case match the rules' conditions and that the law is drafted so as to enforce a unique outcome in each case.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In Section 3 we review logical models of legal reasoning about legal rules in light of the facts of a case.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Rather than focusing on a single legislative or contractual provision, as in the normalisation approach, logic may be used to capture the content of a whole body of law through a set of logical axioms, to logically analyse the implications of that body of law for specific cases.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The proposition {a mathematical formula} Φ ⇒ s Ψ is understood as meaning that Φ counts as Ψ according to institution s. In this framework, agent x's power to bring about the institutional result Ψ through action E Φ (e.g., a power to commit oneself through a promise) is represented as {a mathematical formula}Ea Φ ⇒ sEa Ψ , namely, as the proposition that seeing to it that Φ counts as seeing to it that Ψ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Moreover, we need to consider that legal reasoning proceeds through multiple steps, and usually when a conflict emerges we compare the directly conflicting norms, rather than extend the comparison to the norms which enable us to infer the antecedent conditions of the latter (see [133], or [121] for general considerations on why belief-revision approaches may fail to take into account inferential connections).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Instead, reasoning forms are needed in which case-law rules can be refined and modified, in which factors and reasons play an important role, and in which analogies between cases can be drawn and criticised (on analogy in legal theory see [44]).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However, as a conceptual analysis of legal reasoning with rules, reasons, principles, values and goals it has been very influential, witness the large body of later AI & law work addressing these issues.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Inspired by [99] and [7], we generalised CATO's case representation method in [135] to collections of multi-steps arguments for and against conclusions, where rule priorities are expressed for each pair of conflicting rules, and we allowed that any rule or priority of a precedent is used in a new case.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To represent such value-based interpretations of cases, [126] extended [135]'s case representation method with the means to derive the rule priorities needed for expressing a case decision from value considerations.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A practical-reasoning account of legal interpretation can be applied to model the problem of a court whether to follow or distinguish a rule when a new factor arises (assuming that distinguishing is consistent with the body of precedents).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This decision can be reconstructed as two practical-reasoning arguments for following, respectively, distinguish the old rule, and then preferring the argument for distinguishing the rule by preferring the joint values of safe employment and the public good over the value of freedom of enterprise.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The jurisprudential literature contains discussions of many other forms of argument and some of them have been addressed in AI & law, such as reasoning with dimensions (essentially multi-valued factors), theory construction, hypothetical reasoning and more refined forms of policy arguments, with also demotion of values and with degrees of promotion or demotion.</a>
