<a href="#0" id="0">Now we describe weighted update, which, as we show later seems to be the only approach that uses weights and leads to significant performance improvements at finding a solution given a search problem under tight time constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The main idea underlying weighted update is to make h increase by a factor of w ({a mathematical formula}w ≥ 1) using the update procedure of the Real-Time Heuristic Search algorithm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Specifically, given a region I of states, for each {a mathematical formula}s ∈ I, the heuristic is updated using the following expression.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} Intuitively, this corresponds to assuming the costs of the search graph arcs are higher than usual.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As such h can be interpreted as a cost estimator of the graph that results from multiplying all arcs in the original search graph by w.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Proof of Theorem 5</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that the cost of the path found by wLSS-LRTA* is:{a mathematical formula} and by Lemma 5:{a mathematical formula} However h is w-consistent and thus w-admissible, hence:{a mathematical formula} which means the solution found is w-optimal.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We evaluated wLSS-LRTA* with six weight values {a mathematical formula}{1,2,4,8,16,32} and nine lookahead values {a mathematical formula}{1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256}.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We report the solution cost and the total time per test case obtained by the algorithm for different weight and lookahead values.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Regarding the time per search episode, it is known that the time per search episode increases when the lookahead increases [15], [7].</a>
