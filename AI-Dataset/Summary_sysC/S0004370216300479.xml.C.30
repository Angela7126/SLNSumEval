<a href="#0" id="0">In Section 5, we introduce the {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp language that we use to express first-order temporal properties.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">After that, we show that verification of {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp properties over bounded action theories is decidable, first in the case where we have complete information about the initial situation (Section 6), and then in the general incomplete information case (Section 7).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We say that an action theory {a mathematical formula}D is bounded by b if every executable situation is bounded by b, formally:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}D be a basic action theory.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We define the bounded basic action theory {a mathematical formula}Db by replacing each action precondition axiom in {a mathematical formula}D of the form {a mathematical formula}Poss(a(x → ),s) ≡ Φ (x → ,s) by a precondition axiom of the form{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We say that fluent F is effect bounded if, for every action a and situation s:{a mathematical formula} i.e., for every action and situation, the number of tuples added to the fluent is less than or equal to that deleted.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We say that a basic action theory is effect bounded if every fluent {a mathematical formula}F ∈ F is effect bounded.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">While {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp allows for quantification over objects that persist across situations, the expressiveness of bounded action theories often makes its use avoidable.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let{a mathematical formula}Dbe a bounded action theory with initial situation described by a (bounded) database and with infinite object domain Δ , and let Φ be a closed{a mathematical formula} Μ Lpformula.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then, checking whether{a mathematical formula}D ⊨ Φ is decidable.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Given a basic action theory {a mathematical formula}D, we denote by {a mathematical formula}F the set of its fluent symbols and by C the (finite) set of constants in {a mathematical formula}N explicitly mentioned in {a mathematical formula}D, beyond {a mathematical formula}Duno.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Then, given a model {a mathematical formula}M of {a mathematical formula}D with object domain Δ and a situation s, it is natural to associate s with a FO interpretation {a mathematical formula}IM(s) ≐ 〈 Δ , ⋅ I 〉 , where: (i) for every {a mathematical formula}c ∈ C, {a mathematical formula}cI=cM and (ii) for every (situation-suppressed) fluent F of {a mathematical formula}D, {a mathematical formula}FI={d → | 〈 d → ,s 〉 ∈ FM}.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Among the various TSs, we are interested in those induced by models of the situation calculus action theory {a mathematical formula}D. Consider a model {a mathematical formula}M of {a mathematical formula}D with object domain Δ and situation domain {a mathematical formula}S. The TS induced by{a mathematical formula}M is the labeled TS {a mathematical formula}TM= 〈 Δ ,Q,q0,I, → 〉 , such that:</a>

<a href="#15" id="15">Then, checking whether{a mathematical formula}D ⊨ Φ is decidable.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Verifying{a mathematical formula} Μ Lpformulas over a situation calculus basic action theory bounded by b, with complete information on the initial situation, can be done in time exponential in b.This is a consequence of Procedure 1 and the complexity of {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp model checking.</a>
