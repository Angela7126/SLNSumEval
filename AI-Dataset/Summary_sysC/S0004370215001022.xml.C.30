<a href="#0" id="0">Using the auxiliary variables, the soft constraint expressing that the points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj are assigned to the same cluster can be encoded as the clause{a mathematical formula} For some intuition, we note that if this clause is satisfied in a solution Τ , then for some k, {a mathematical formula} Τ (Aijk)=1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since all hard clauses are satisfied in any solution, it follows that points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj will be assigned to cluster k, exactly as required.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Similarly, if points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj are not assigned to the same cluster, then due to the hard constraints we have {a mathematical formula} Τ (Aijk)=0 for all k, and the soft clause will not be satisfied.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Each unsatisfied clause must increase the cost of a MaxSAT solution according to the similarity values of the corresponding points, which is why the weight of the clause is set to {a mathematical formula}W(i,j).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given a solution Τ to {a mathematical formula}F2, we can easily construct a corresponding well-defined clustering {a mathematical formula}cl Τ of the data points by assigning each point {a mathematical formula}vi into the cluster k for which {a mathematical formula} Τ (yik)=1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Due to the hard constraints {a mathematical formula}Fh2, in any solution Τ there is exactly one such k for every i.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given a set V of data points with{a mathematical formula}|V|=N, a symmetric similarity matrix W over V, and an upper limit K on the available clusters such that{a mathematical formula}1 ≤ K ≤ N, let{a mathematical formula}F2be the MaxSAT instance produced by the unary encoding on W. The clustering{a mathematical formula}cl Τ ⁎ :V → {1, … K}constructed from an optimal solution{a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ to{a mathematical formula}F2is an optimal clustering of V over all clusterings{a mathematical formula}cl:V → {1, … K}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In other words,{a mathematical formula}cl Τ ⁎ is optimal over all clusterings of V that use at most K clusters.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let {a mathematical formula}F2 be a MaxSAT instance generated with the unary encoding and, given a solution Τ to {a mathematical formula}F2, let {a mathematical formula}cl Τ be the clustering constructed form Τ by the procedure described in Section 7.5.</a>
