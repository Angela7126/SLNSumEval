<a href="#0" id="0">In a CLP for structured domains we are interested in finding the generator's parameters {a mathematical formula} Θ ⁎ that minimize the difference between the concept C and the concept corresponding to the set of generated graphs, that is, between the two probability distributions P and {a mathematical formula}P Θ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Constructive learning problem for finite samplesLet {a mathematical formula}S(G,G ′ ) be a similarity measure between two sets of graphs defined in terms of an underlying graph kernel {a mathematical formula}K( ⋅ , ⋅ ) between two graphs:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}The constructive learning problem for finite samples is the solution to the following optimization problem:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The main difficulty in solving the constructive learning problem rests on 1) the generator {a mathematical formula}M Θ , which can be viewed as a procedure to obtain a set of instances, and 2) its optimization, which is a procedure to adapt the probability distribution of the output instances to a desired shape.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To convince oneself that the substitutable graph grammar yields a proposal distribution that is in first approximation consider how the inner core replacement procedure works: starting from a graph G we select an inner core graph C and an interface graph I, we then identify all core/interface pairs where the interface matches I up to isomorphism and uniformly at random choose one core {a mathematical formula}C ′ for the replacement to yield graph {a mathematical formula}G ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If we now start from graph {a mathematical formula}G ′ and select the inner core graph {a mathematical formula}C ′ and interface I we can see that we can choose C with the same uniform probability (the core/interface pairs set is the same) yielding G.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As an illustrative example consider the substitution of a small core with a large core; in this case a greater number of nodes exist after the substitution and hence the exact inverse transition {a mathematical formula}g(G ′ → G) is less probable since there exist more roots to sample from for the core replacement.</a>
