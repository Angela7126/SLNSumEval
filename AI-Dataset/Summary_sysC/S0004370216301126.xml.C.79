<a href="#0" id="0">We associate each allocation A that is reached in a sequence of deals with a function {a mathematical formula} Π :N → R mapping agents to the sum of payments they have made so far, i.e., we also have {a mathematical formula} ∑ i Π (i)=0.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The LUPF divides this amount equally amongst the participating agents {a mathematical formula}N Δ ; the GUPF divides it equally amongst all agents {a mathematical formula}N:{a mathematical formula} Importantly, note that the social surplus {a mathematical formula}sw(A ′ ) − sw(A) can always be computed from the valuation functions of the participating agents alone:{a mathematical formula} Thus, the LUPF is a fully local payment function: it only requires us to consider input from the participating agents and only the payment balances of these agents will be affected.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An outcome, assigning each agent a bundle of goods and a payment balance, is proportional if the utility each agent assigns to their lot is at least {a mathematical formula}1/nth of the value they place on the full set of goods (where n is the number of agents).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Recall that defining a payment scheme involves fixing an initial payment {a mathematical formula} Π 0(i) for each agent and choosing a payment function p. Our approach is simply to choose {a mathematical formula} Π 0 and p such that at each stage {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) of the negotiation we will have {a mathematical formula} Π (i)=exi(A) − Ex(A)/n, thereby emulating the payments prescribed by the Knaster procedure (with the crucial difference that in the Knaster procedure payments are only required once, at the very end).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For convergence to an efficient allocation by means of IR deals, {a mathematical formula}nm − 1, with n being the number of agents and m being the number of goods, is known to be a (tight) upper bound on the longest path, i.e., there exist profiles of valuation functions and initial allocations such that it is possible to visit all allocations before convergence [29].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This means, that there exists a sequence of IR deals that visits all {a mathematical formula}nm allocations (each of the m goods may be given to any of the n agents), and thus {a mathematical formula}nm − 1 is a tight upper bound on the length of the longest path for scenarios covered by Theorem 4, also when valuations are subject to the restrictions we have argued to be natural for studies of proportional fairness.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Path length to a proportional stateWe can find a valuation function for each agent and an initial allocation such that there exists a sequence of IR deals with Knaster payments that will achieve proportionality only after exactly{a mathematical formula}nm − 1deals.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Take a scenario where the agents have the valuation functions used in the proof of Lemma 6, except that {a mathematical formula}vn(G) is set to such a high value that the only way of achieving a proportional state is to give all goods to agent n (because no payments the other agents would be prepared to make could be large enough to give utility {a mathematical formula}vn(G)/n to agent n).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">First, observe that under the payment scheme of Theorem 8, which is characterised by Inequality (2), the envy-freeness condition {a mathematical formula}ui(A(i), Π (i)) ⩾ ui(A(j), Π (j)) is equivalent to the following inequality (which must hold for any two agents i and j):{a mathematical formula} To prove the claim of the theorem, we give an example with two agents and two goods, where Inequality (3) fails to be satisfied for the unique efficient allocation.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To make this claim precise, let us call a payment function p path-independent if there exists a function {a mathematical formula}f:N×Rn → R such that for any deal {a mathematical formula} Δ =(A,A ′ ) the payment {a mathematical formula}p(i) of any agent i is equal to {a mathematical formula}f(i, 〈 Δ 1, … , Δ n 〉 ), where {a mathematical formula} Δ j=vj(A ′ ) − vj(A).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Of course, any number of payment functions could achieve these final payment balances, as long as we can be sure that the rule applied during the very last deal is such that we get the correct values for {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In particular, knowing only the differences in individual valuations between two allocations A and {a mathematical formula}A ′ is not sufficient information to determine whether {a mathematical formula}A ′ is efficient, i.e., whether the process will terminate once {a mathematical formula}A ′ is reached.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We now prove a convergence theorem for GEF states, which extends Theorem 8 to the framework with a negotiation topology: we show that under the same conditions (on the valuation functions and for a particular choice of payment scheme), any sequence of IR deals that respect the negotiation topology will result in a GEF state.</a>
