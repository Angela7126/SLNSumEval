<a href="#0" id="0">Several books and survey papers review the state of the art for a few focused deliberation functions, e.g., planning [91], monitoring [169], goal reasoning [213], recognition of actions and plans [129], architectures [127], or human – aware navigation [130].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The rest of the survey develops an analysis of several contributions to deliberation functions (Sections 3 Planning, 4 Acting, 5 Monitoring and goal reasoning, 6 Observing, 7 Acquiring deliberation models).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Two main functions, namely planning and acting, are extensively discussed, while the survey is more illustrative for the monitoring, observing and model acquisition functions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">deliberation in robotics does not reduce to task planning,</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The integration of planning and acting functions is a critical issues in the design of a deliberation system.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To clarify the range of design options, let us oppose two main views emphasizing respectively planning and acting.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">One may characterize ideas and approaches for specifying deliberation models for planning and acting into the following categories:</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Multiple model approaches use distinct models: an abstract descriptive model for planning and one or several operational models for acting to refine each plan step into skills.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">These approaches may use either (i) a uniform knowledge representation for specifying planning and acting problems at different levels of granularity, e.g., formal action languages, or (ii) heterogeneous knowledge representations at various levels, e.g., precondition – effect operators for planning, procedures or rules for acting.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In what follows, we'll review contributions that have an emphasis on, successively, planning, acting, monitoring, observing and modeling (Sections 3 Planning, 4 Acting, 5 Monitoring and goal reasoning, 6 Observing, 7 Acquiring deliberation models).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Planning is a core deliberation function for an autonomous robot.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However, temporal planners that rely on timelines, i.e., partially specified evolution of state variables over time, are more flexible in the integration of planning and acting and, in most cases, more expressive, e.g., allowing the reference to instants beyond starting and ending time of actions.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Constraint programming and plan space search are also quite popular in reviewed systems.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As we will see next, they offer some advantages in the integration of planning and acting and in plan repair.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Other important issues are how the acting skills are acquired, either synthesized automatically, hand written, or obtained through a learning mechanisms, and how they are used, as directly executable programs or as specification models from which further deliberation is performed.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Acting knowledge has also to be checked for consistency with respect to planning models.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Another important point is that all CSP approaches rely on common models to produce plans, skills and commands (often the separation between planning and acting is not sharp).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Probabilistic approaches are also appealing for the interleaving of planning and acting.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Algorithms such as RTDP [13] and LRTDP [26] offer an anytime approach interleaving planning and acting, when both functions are defined on the same state and action spaces.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Early systems assumed that planning primitives were directly executable, reducing the acting function to reacting without much refinement deliberation.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Altogether, this system proposes a coherent continuum from planning to acting, observing and monitoring.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">It has to be tightly integrated with planning, acting and monitoring.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">This system is naturally queried by planning, acting and monitoring functions to acquire information about the current contextual state of the world.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We also discussed a comprehensive stream-based approach for integrating an observing system with planning, acting and monitoring.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Semantic maps endow a robot with deduction abilities about its environment that complement and enhance its perceiving function as well as its planning and acting functions.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Learning methods acquire either policies, state – action dynamics from which policies can be derived, or explicit action models permitting deliberation and planning.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">We discussed a few approaches for acquiring semantic maps and integrating the learned knowledge into planning and acting models.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Numerous deliberation systems were discussed in Sections 3 Planning, 4 Acting, 5 Monitoring and goal reasoning, 6 Observing, 7 Acquiring deliberation models, along their planning, acting, monitoring, observing and learning functions.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Most analyzed systems address three main functions: planning, acting and monitoring.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">It is interesting to note that, in most of these systems, planning explicitly takes into account space and time.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Probabilistic and other nondeterministic planners have, for the moment, a narrower use, mostly at the sensory-motor level, e.g., within reinforcement learning approaches.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Their integration in deliberation system will certainly be developed, in particular at the acting level.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">A few of the analyzed systems consider planning primitives as executable commands; this limits the acting function mostly to reacting to events.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Most systems do, however, introduce a refinement level between planning primitives and commands.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">The majority use different knowledge representations for planning and acting.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">This issue of an integrated representation between planning and acting is clearly a weak point in analyzed systems (except for IDEA and T-REX with their state variables hierarchy and the continuum between acting and planning).</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Such a representation should clarify the various refinement levels (at least two, possibly more) in terms of different state spaces and actions spaces and the relation between these spaces, e.g., the state space at a level i being a refinement of the more abstract level {a mathematical formula}i − 1, with a clear mapping from i to {a mathematical formula}i − 1 spaces.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">In a few cases, both rely on the same knowledge representation, e.g., Temporal Action Logic in the WITAS/TALPlan approach or Temporal Plan Networks in the RMPL system.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">The notion of monitoring formulas synthesized from plan invariants and from additional domain knowledge seems quite effective and should be more widely deployed in deliberation systems.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">The integration of an observing function in the deliberation system is less frequent in the analyzed approaches.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">It is quite narrow in DS1/RAX and IxTeT-Reco (despite the common chronicle representation for planning and observing).</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Learning appears in only one of the analyzed systems: XFRM/RPL/CRAM.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Our discussion in Section 7 indicates that learning is quite successful in robotics at the sensory-motor level.</a>
