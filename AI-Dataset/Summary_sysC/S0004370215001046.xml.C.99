<a href="#0" id="0">The major challenge for relation extraction is that most relation instances occur within a sentence or clause, and they usually consist of only a few words, which often leads to a sparse feature representation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Based on the characteristics of Chinese, we proposed an omni-word feature and a soft constraint method for Chinese relation extraction in our previous study [9], but many details of the omni-word feature and soft constraint were not fully explored.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Both of these studies used dependency trees and parse trees to capture the local dependency of relation instances, but they used another strategy to control the asymmetric relation problem, i.e., a new inverted relation type was introduced for each asymmetric relation type.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, they evaluated their methods based only on annotated “ true ” relation mentions, which yielded more balanced evaluation data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To extract relations at the sentence level, a limited number of words is often involved, which yields a sparse feature representation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This limited number of words also leads to feature sparsity when extracting targeted units at the sentence level.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, utilizing the structural and functional information in a relation instance is important for relation extraction.</a>
