<a href="#0" id="0">Second, the prediction algorithms using such a strategy are not guaranteed to produce perfect estimates as the number of samples grow large (CDP of the search tree size and SCP of the optimal solution cost).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is because the values of {a mathematical formula} Π (t|u) and {a mathematical formula} Β u are dependent on the state space as opposed to being dependent on the problem instance [34].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, due to SCP's sampling strategy, the parameter c does not necessarily approximate the actual probability of finding a goal type at a given level of the search from the start state.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The set of all types encountered during the p probes in the forward search is stored in the structure {a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ F (line 4 of Algorithm 2).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Similarly, the set of all types encountered during the p probes in the backward search is stored in the structure {a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ B (line 5 of Algorithm 2).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Once BiSS finishes the p probes it uses the information stored in {a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ F and {a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ B to produce an estimate of the optimal solution cost (from line 7 to line 17 of Algorithm 2).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">BiSS looks for a match of the forward and the backward frontiers while accounting for the set of types in {a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ F and {a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ B.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">That is, once a match occurs between {a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ F and {a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ BBiSS, returns {a mathematical formula}nF+nB as the estimated optimal solution cost of a path between {a mathematical formula}s ⁎ and g.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Intuitively, a single probe of BiSS is able to produce a perfect prediction of the optimal solution cost when using a type system that has goal types and obeys Equation (1) for all nodes s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ of the same type, and when {a mathematical formula} Γ =1.0.</a>
