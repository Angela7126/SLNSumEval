<a href="#0" id="0">By varying the initial conditions and the context, envisioning reasons about the generality (or the limitations) of a plan which could have been generated using classical and motion planning methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, envisioning provides supplementary reasoning capabilities that go beyond simple predictions, enabling robots to know what could happen when they themselves perform a task within a given context.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The aim of this work is not to realize this control mechanism, but rather to acquire the commonsense knowledge and generate the models that can be used within reasoning components.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As will be shown later, we generate a model in form of a decision tree to determine the tilt angle of the container when pouring the pancake mix based on a desired pancake size and a given task context.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">There are three ways of asserting an entity: either by naming the entity, if it is already known by the knowledge base including its physical specifications that are needed by the simulator; by providing the physical specifications of a previously unknown entity explicitly; or by providing an object type that can be generated by the object model factory.envision(Scenario, Plan(Params), Timeline)performs a simulation-based temporal projection for an asserted scenario and a fully instantiated robot control program/plan, and returns an ID of the projected timeline.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This incomplete list of contexts and queries illustrates where the developed framework and learned models can be employed in order to adjust the behavior, and to improve the overall performance, of robots.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, we believe that the underlying idea and the developed methods of this work can have a broad impact in field of robotics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The main limitations of these approaches in the context of robotics are threefold: (a) important details such as positions of manipulators and objects are abstracted away; (b) variants of problems such as manipulating an object with different physical properties cannot be handled without extending the logical theory; and (c) consequences of concurrent actions and events are very difficult to foresee with pure symbolic reasoning, e.g., what does a robot see when turning its camera while navigating through its environment?</a>
