<a href="#0" id="0">One would again expect the belief in {a mathematical formula}(h<9) to be .7, but instead of being the result of summing weights, it must now be the result of integrating densities over a suitable space of values, something quite beyond the BHL approach.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So, on the one hand, the BHL account and others like it can be seen as general formal theories that attempt to address important philosophical problems such as those raised by McCarthy and Hayes above.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In general, a basic action theory {a mathematical formula}D is a set of sentences consisting of (free variables understood as universally quantified from the outside):</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The function g from {a mathematical formula}N to {a mathematical formula}R is assumed to not conflict with f. (That is, the logical terms are distinct.)</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, we define the definite integral of t over all real values of x by the following:{a mathematical formula} The main result for this logical abbreviation is the following:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Without going into full details, assume the provision of domain-specific sensing axioms, also part of the basic action theory {a mathematical formula}D. For example,{a mathematical formula} formalizes the sensing outcome for an action to check whether f has value 1 in situation s. Here SF is a special {a mathematical formula}L-predicate, similar to Poss.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Next, the term {a mathematical formula}l(a,s) is intended to denote the likelihood of action a occurring in situation s. Among other things, l can be used to model noisy sensors.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let us contrast (2) with the following initial axiom for p:{a mathematical formula} Then, letting a basic action theory include the sentence:{a mathematical formula} means that the robot believes h is uniformly distributed on {a mathematical formula}{2,3} or on {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,10} without being able to say which.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Step (a) expands P. In step (b), owing to the fact that sensing actions do not change fluent values (by our first assumption tailored to Bayesian conditioning), {a mathematical formula} Φ [do(a, Ι )] is equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Φ [ Ι ].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">(The main reason for introducing the formula {a mathematical formula}f=x is to allow us to identify those situations where f takes the value x which are all to be multiplied by the error likelihood for observing z when the true value is x.)</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Following [5], perhaps the simplest extension to make all this precise is to assume that deterministic actions such as {a mathematical formula}move(x) now have companion action types {a mathematical formula}move(x,y) in {a mathematical formula}L. The intuition is that x represents the nominal value, which is the number of units that the agent intends to move, while y represents the actual distance moved.</a>
