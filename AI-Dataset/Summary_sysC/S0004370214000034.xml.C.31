<a href="#2" id="2">For {a mathematical formula}c ∈ CB, denote the {a mathematical formula}RelatedSet(c) with regard to CB as {a mathematical formula}RCB(c), and we define the Related Closure of c with regard to CB as{a mathematical formula} For a group of cases {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ CB, we define the Related Closure of S with regard to CB as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Example 1</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}CB={c1,c2,c3,c4}, {a mathematical formula}RCB(c1)={c1,c2}, {a mathematical formula}RCB(c2)={c1,c2,c3,c4}, {a mathematical formula}RCB(c3)=RCB(c4)={c2,c3,c4}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The related closure of {a mathematical formula}c3 is the set of all related sets, with regard to CB, which contain the case {a mathematical formula}c3.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Example 2</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let {a mathematical formula}S={c1,c4} be a case sample set taken from the case base in Example 1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The related closure of S is the set of all related sets that contain at least one element in S. We have{a mathematical formula} thus {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(S)={{c1,c2},{c2,c3,c4},{c1,c2,c3,c4}}.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let {a mathematical formula} ℜ 1CB(S)={c1,c2}, the weight of {a mathematical formula}{c1,c2} with regard to S is{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Definition 9</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The density weights each related set in a related closure by the degree to which the sample cases are distributed.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We then define the competence-based empirical weight of a case sample with regard to a certain interesting sub-problem space (Definition 9).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Given a case base CB, and a case sample set {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ CB, denote the power set of {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(CB) as {a mathematical formula} ℘ ( ℜ CB(CB)).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Considering {a mathematical formula} ℘ ( ℜ CB(CB)) as the measurable space {an inline-figure}, for {a mathematical formula}A ∈ {an inline-figure}, we define the competence-based empirical weight of S with regard to A over CB as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For any case sample set S, the competence-based empirical weight provides a reference to the degree of case distribution on a competence area represented by A – a sub-set of {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(CB).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The higher the weight is, the larger is the proportion of cases in S that support the selected competence area.</a>
