<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}Et be the feature vector that represents these external factors at predicted time interval t. In our implementation, we mainly consider weather, holiday event, and metadata (e.g.</a>

<a href="#2" id="2">the number of residual units increases), the RMSE of the model first decreases and then increases, demonstrating that the deeper network often has a better result because it can capture not only near spatial dependence but also distant one.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To better understand the temporal closeness, period and trend, we here visualize the parameters of the parametric-matrix-based fusion layer, which is capable of learning different temporal influence degrees for each region of a city, as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As introducing in Section 4.1, there are four main steps to predict crowd flows for each region of a city: (1) pulling trajectories from Redis; (2) converting trajectories into crowd flow data; (3) predicting the crowd flows in near future; (4) pushing results into Redis.</a>
