<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search [3] uses admissible heuristics that provide a lower bound on the distance from a state to the goal to reduce the number of expanded states.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Regression in planning is commonly thought to be less robust than progression due to (a) the existence of multiple goal states, which requires considering partially-defined states (i.e., in which the value of some variables is unknown) and (b) the impact that states unreachable from the initial state have on backward search [7].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A fact is an assignment to a single variable and is usually identified as a variable-value pair, {a mathematical formula} 〈 v,d ∈ Dv 〉 .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, a partial state p can be defined as a set of facts and is associated with the set of states that satisfy the partial assignment, {a mathematical formula}{s|p[v]=s[v] ∀ v ∈ Vp}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We denote as {a mathematical formula}p|V ′ the projection of p to the set of variables {a mathematical formula}V ′ ⊆ Vp, i.e., as the partial assignment over {a mathematical formula}V ′ having the same value as p for variables it is defined for.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}O is a set of operators, where each operator is a tuple {a mathematical formula}o= 〈 (pre(o),eff(o),w(o)) 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}pre(o) and {a mathematical formula}eff(o) are partial assignments over {a mathematical formula}Vpre(o) and {a mathematical formula}Veff(o) that represent the preconditions and effects of the operator, respectively, and {a mathematical formula}w(o) ↦ R0+ is the non-negative cost of o.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The set of preconditions, {a mathematical formula}pre(o) can be split depending on whether they are affected by the operator effects or not.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The prevail conditions of the operators are the subset of preconditions that are not affected by the effects of the operator, {a mathematical formula}prev(o)={fi= 〈 v,d 〉 |fi ∈ pre(o) and v ∉ Veff(o)}.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">An operator {a mathematical formula}o ∈ O is applicable (in progression) in a state s if {a mathematical formula}pre(o) ⊆ s.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The existential quantification of a variable Υ , {a mathematical formula} ∃ Υ S, computes the projection of S to {a mathematical formula}V ∖ { Υ }.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Formally, {a mathematical formula} ∃ Υ S:=S| Υ = ⊤ ∨ S| Υ = ⊥ , where {a mathematical formula}fS| Υ =x:=(fS ∧ {s|s[ Υ ]=x})|V ∖ { Υ } is the sets of assignments to variables {a mathematical formula}V ∖ { Υ } so that they make {a mathematical formula}fS true whenever {a mathematical formula} Υ =x.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The algorithm may stop when the sum of the minimum g values of generated states for the forward and backward searches is at least {a mathematical formula}wtotal, the cost of the cheapest solution path found so far.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The image operation of a set of states with respect to a given transition relation can be decomposed into basic logical operations over BDDs: {a mathematical formula}image(S,T):=( ∃ x(S ∧ T))[x ′ /x].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The conjunction {a mathematical formula}S ∧ T corresponds tow all pairs of states {a mathematical formula} 〈 s,s ′ 〉 such that {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S and {a mathematical formula}s ′ =o(s) for an operator o represented by T. Then, the existential quantification ignores predecessor states and the variable swapping, {a mathematical formula}[x ′ /x], represents the resulting states {a mathematical formula}s ′ with the standard set of variables x.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In symbolic model checking, a conjunctive partitioning is often better because most studied systems are described in terms of rules that are applied in parallel.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For this reason, research has generally been focused on the problem of scheduling the conjunction and quantification operations during image computation [43], [44], with a few works combining both types of partitioning [45].</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Our first method for image computation, {a mathematical formula}TR1+, leverages the particular structure of planning operators for faster image computation when a TR {a mathematical formula}To encodes a single operator o.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">First, as all variables not appearing in the effects retain their values, the existential quantification and variable swapping only need to be applied over variables modified by {a mathematical formula}eff(o), which we call {a mathematical formula}xo.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Therefore, the bi-implication term may be omitted from {a mathematical formula}To, using instead {a mathematical formula}To ˜ , which is defined as: {a mathematical formula}To ˜ = ⋀ 〈 v,val 〉 ∈ pre(o)fBDD(v,val,x) ∧ ⋀ 〈 v,val 〉 ∈ eff(o)fBDD(v,val,x ′ ).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">This way the variables representing the successor states {a mathematical formula}x ′ as well as the swap operation are no longer needed, reducing the size of intermediate BDDs and speeding up image computation.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">{a mathematical formula}CT has several advantages over the baseline approach: first, if S does not contain any state matching the conditions of a branch of the tree, all the operators regarding that branch are ignored, which reduces the number of individual image operations that are needed.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The conjunction with a precondition should only be used when the benefits compensate the overhead, i.e., when a precondition is shared between many operators.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Thus, {a mathematical formula}CT can be parameterized with a parameter min operators conjunction, so that the intermediate conjunction with a partial precondition is only computed when needed for at least that number of operators.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">If the number of operators that should go down some edge is less than min operators conjunction, they are propagated down the don't care branch {a mathematical formula}c ⋆ instead, and marked so that we know that not all their preconditions have been checked.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The algorithm aggregates TRs using equation (2) until a monolithic TR is created or the time and memory (in terms of BDD nodes) bounds are exceeded.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Recall that, as the cost of reaching a state must be preserved, only operators with the same cost w may be aggregated.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Therefore, we call the algorithm once per different cost, i, with {a mathematical formula}Ti={To|o ∈ O,w(o)=i}.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">We may deduce condition (2) assuming that M is relevant for o in regression, i.e., there exists a state s such that {a mathematical formula}M ⊨ o(s) and {a mathematical formula}M ⊭ s.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">We do not contemplate this possibility since it would require maintaining different cBDDs, one per operator, and it cannot be combined with methods of image computation that represent multiples operators in the same TR as explained in Section 4.4.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Therefore, unlike the case of search in the original state space, {a mathematical formula}MBDD does not perform all the pruning possible.</a>
