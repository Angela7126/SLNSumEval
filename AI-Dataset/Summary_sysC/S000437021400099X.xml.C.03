<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:2} The unrestricted black-box complexity of this LeadingOnes problem is known to be of order {a mathematical formula} Θ (nlog ⁡ log ⁡ n)[1].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For LeadingOnes, it is known [13] that 3-ary operators reduce the unbiased black-box complexity to {a mathematical formula}O(nlog ⁡ n/log ⁡ log ⁡ n).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The k-ary unbiased black-box complexity of some class of functions {a mathematical formula}F is the complexity of {a mathematical formula}F with respect to all k-ary unbiased black-box algorithms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For any set C of pseudo-Boolean functions we write {a mathematical formula}UBBk(C) to denote the k-ary unbiased black-box complexity of C.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then the black-box complexity of P is at most {a mathematical formula}O(s).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As has already been pointed out in [10], the unrestricted black-box complexity of MaxClique is at most {a mathematical formula}(n2)+1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For two different models of {a mathematical formula}Partition ≠ , different with respect to the objective function, we show (Theorem 4, Theorem 6) that the unary unbiased black-box complexity is {a mathematical formula}O(nlog ⁡ n).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">That is, we give a unary unbiased black-box algorithm which solves any instance of {a mathematical formula}Partition ≠ in {a mathematical formula}O(nlog ⁡ n) queries.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As mentioned, we first consider a signed objective function for {a mathematical formula}Partition ≠ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This implies, in particular, that the unrestricted black-box complexity of Partition is linear in {a mathematical formula}|I|.</a>
