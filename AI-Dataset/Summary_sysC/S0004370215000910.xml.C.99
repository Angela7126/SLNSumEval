<a href="#0" id="0">Since law has social objectives and social effects, it must be understood by those affected by it, and its application must be explained and justified.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">All these aspects of the law, i.e., its orientation to future and not fully anticipated situations, the tension between the general terms of the law and the particulars of a case, and the adversarial nature of legal procedures, make that legal reasoning goes beyond the literal meaning of the legal rules and involves appeals to precedent, principle, policy and purpose, and involves the attack as well as the construction of arguments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Classifying the facts under legal concepts involves interpretation in a broad sense, i.e., the ampliative reasoning process which, on the basis of legal sources, determines the content of legal norms and concepts (legal interpretation in a strict sense, i.e., the attribution of a meaning to a specific legal provision in cases of doubt is an aspect of that).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, when deriving legal consequences from the classified facts, the main modes of reasoning are deductive but with room for nonmonotonic techniques to deal with exceptions to rules, either statutory or based on principle and purpose, and to choose between conflicting rules on the basis of the general hierarchy of legal systems, with rules from different sources.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The reasoning forms employed in the law may thus not only depend on the nature of the issue addressed but also on the context in which the reasoning takes place.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Rather than focusing on a single legislative or contractual provision, as in the normalisation approach, logic may be used to capture the content of a whole body of law through a set of logical axioms, to logically analyse the implications of that body of law for specific cases.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To some such inferences are counterintuitive but others argue that the counterintuitiveness disappears if deontic logic is not seen as a way of deriving new norms but as a way of determining what should be done in order to comply with a given a set of norms [75].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, if the law requires us to realise Φ , we should not be surprised that this means that we should also realise {a mathematical formula} Φ ∨ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This does not mean that, given a normative set including an explicit obligation {a mathematical formula}O Φ , the conclusion that {a mathematical formula}O( Φ ∨ Ψ ) may be the content of a sensible communication.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Sometimes, the term “ legal ontology ” is used to include attempts to identify the basic structures of legal knowledge, even without providing a computational ontology in the strict sense.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As such attempts we can mention the Functional Ontology for Law-FOLaw [167], specifying dependencies between types of knowledge in legal reasoning, McCarty's Language of Legal Discourse[105], which has been applied to the formal definition of the concept of ownership [106] and Hage and Verheij's [73] model of the law as a set of logically connected states of affairs.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In the approaches so far presented legal dynamics is addressed through defeasible temporal persistence, with regard to both the validity/applicability of the concerned legal norms and the effects established by valid norms.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Thus a legal knowledge base always grows with the addition of new norms, the termination of the validity of a norm determining the inapplicability of that norm to subsequent cases (for a similar approach, see [180]).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">However, such case-based interpretation rules are often case-specific, so a new case will rarely exactly match the precedent, and consequently, techniques for handling conflicting rules fall short.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Instead, reasoning forms are needed in which case-law rules can be refined and modified, in which factors and reasons play an important role, and in which analogies between cases can be drawn and criticised (on analogy in legal theory see [44]).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Without the secondary level these reasons would in each case have to be weighed to obtain a conclusion, but according to Hage and Verheij rules express the outcome of such a weighing process.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Therefore, a rule does not only generate a reason for its consequent but also generates a so-called ‘ exclusionary ’ reason against applying the principles underlying the rule: the rule replaces the reasons on which it is based.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">However, as a conceptual analysis of legal reasoning with rules, reasons, principles, values and goals it has been very influential, witness the large body of later AI & law work addressing these issues.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">A practical-reasoning account of legal interpretation can be applied to model the problem of a court whether to follow or distinguish a rule when a new factor arises (assuming that distinguishing is consistent with the body of precedents).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">From a logical point of view two main issues arise: which model of rational proof can best be applied to the law, and what is the logical nature of important legal evidential constructs like burdens of proof and presumptions?</a>
