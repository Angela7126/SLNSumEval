<a href="#0" id="0">Since we are assuming a fixed arity k, the assumption that N is in unary is convenient because it implies that the size of an intended interpretation I is polynomial in N. Therefore, an algorithm for these problems can explicitly represent an interpretation of the required size and test it.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To achieve this, we first ensure that the interpretation has at least two different objects, referred to by variables {a mathematical formula}y1 and {a mathematical formula}y2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that in this case H is not a complete graph and we are indeed only testing for the edges in H. This construction can be done in polynomial time for any G and H.Finally we connect the three portions together to obtain {a mathematical formula}B2 as follows.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus the problem is in co-NP.For the inductive step assume that the claim holds for {a mathematical formula}k − 1 and consider the input {a mathematical formula}(B,I,V) with an interpretation I, value bound V and a max-k-alternating diagram {a mathematical formula}B=maxw1 ⁡ minw2 ⁡ … QwkAB(w1, … ,wk) where in order to simplify the notation each {a mathematical formula}wi may be a single variable or a set of variables and we use the boldface notation to denote this fact.Now for each tuple i of domain objects in I (which is appropriate for the number of variables in {a mathematical formula}w1) let diagram {a mathematical formula}B ′ be {a mathematical formula}B ′ =minw2 ⁡ … QwkAB(w1=i, … ,wk).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The claim then follows because the prefix includes all variables and there is a 1 – 1 correspondence in truth values for substitutions in group 1.For the inductive step, the valuation v covers the first {a mathematical formula}j − 1 blocks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The two portions are put together so as to respect predicate order, and the final diagram {a mathematical formula}B1 is shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A legal interpretation embeds the binary interpretation {a mathematical formula}I ⁎ from the previous proof and in addition includes a truth setting for all the variables in the first ∀ block of the QBF.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the current proof {a mathematical formula}xi is a set of variables from the QBF and therefore {a mathematical formula}wi is a set of blocks of variables, all of which have the same aggregation function.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The combined aggregation function is {a mathematical formula}maxw1 ⁡ ,maxw2 ⁡ ,minw3 ⁡ , … ,QwkA.We next show that claim C2 holds, which will complete the proof of the simplified construction.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The claim then follows because the prefix includes all variables and there is a 1 – 1 correspondence in truth values for substitutions in group 1.For the inductive step, the valuation v covers the first {a mathematical formula}j − 1 blocks.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Nonetheless, the same argument from the simple case can be used to show that C1 and {a mathematical formula}C2 ′ imply that {a mathematical formula}B1 and B are equivalent iff the QBF is satisfied.To prove the claim first note that by the construction B adds more tests on the path to a 1 leaf of {a mathematical formula}B1 and does not add any other paths to a value of 1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore, if {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I)=1 and thus the max aggregation over these prefix variables yields 1, it must be through the intended valuation {a mathematical formula} Ζ p for the prefix {a mathematical formula}T,y1,y2,x1, … ,x ℓ .However, when {a mathematical formula}T,y1,y2,x1, … ,x ℓ are fixed to their intended values, the portions of the diagram testing for {a mathematical formula} ≤ q+3 objects, the uniqueness of special objects {a mathematical formula}T,y1,y2,x1, … ,xk, the symmetry of {a mathematical formula}q() and its simulation of {a mathematical formula}PT() and {a mathematical formula}Pxi do not affect the final value in the sense that a valuation reaching them always continues to the next block.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Now we observe that there is a 1 – 1 correspondence between valuations and values of the resulting B to valuations and values of {a mathematical formula}B2 in the simple construction (where we extend the notion of block consistent to enforce that {a mathematical formula}wi bind to {a mathematical formula}y1,y2).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">GFODD Value for diagrams with aggregation depth k (where{a mathematical formula}k ≥ 2) is{a mathematical formula} Σ k+1P-complete.The proof of Theorem 16 goes through almost directly and requires only a slight wording variation.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For membership we get the bound on interpretation size by the assumption on the input; then the algorithm is the same.For the reduction, we use Theorem 1 to calculate {a mathematical formula}B=Apply(B1,B2,+).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We build {a mathematical formula}B1, {a mathematical formula}B2 and B exactly as in Theorem 22 with one exception: the leaf values on the diagram that checks for block consistency are flipped from the previous construction (because the corresponding aggregation operators are switched).</a>
