<a href="#0" id="0">For instance if the simulation of a rigid pendulum uses a simple Euler method for the updating of the physical state from one time point to the next, the simulation will incorrectly predict that the pendulum swings back and forth a few times, reaching a higher angle on each swing, until eventually it rotates in a full vertical circle in one direction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although it is relatively easy to carry out an approximate computer simulation of a die rolling and to render it in an animation, it is extremely difficult to accurately predict the outcome of an actual roll of dice, even if the starting conditions are specified precisely [29].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A student in freshman physics, by contrast, will probably approximate the bob as a point mass which is constrained to move on a circle of fixed radius; the resulting simulation will certainly be easier to carry out and quite possibly more accurate.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, different high-quality physics engines can give radically difficult predictions for a single problem, particularly when the problem involves a device with feedback.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given a probability distribution over a space of physical situations, a program generates some large collection of specific situations following the distribution; it carries out a simulation based on each of these; and then it considers these behaviors as a random sample of the possible behaviors.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">One can immediately infer a number of constraints; it can't be completely closed, or the toad will suffocate; it can't be open on top, or the toad will jump out; it must be possible to get food and water to the toad and clean the terrarium; it needs to have a flat bottom; it needs to fit on the shelf; and so on.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These constraints must be derived before the design and dimensions of the terrarium can be chosen or simulated.Comparative analysis:How does a modification to a problem affect the solution?</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For instance, you can reason that if you make an object heavier, then it will become more difficult to lift.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Simulation theories, might at first blush seem to be immune to the so-called frame problem – of efficiently reasoning about the aspects of a situation that do not change over time – that has often bedeviled knowledge-based theories [44]; in reality, the frame problem arises in simulation in very much the same ways and to the same extent as in knowledge-based theories, avoidable in simple cases [55], [52], daunting in many more complex cases.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The key hallmark of the frame problem here is the needless repetition of the calculation that nothing in tower B changes; in particular categories of cases, it may be possible to recognize that this part of the situation is repeated, and to retrieve the previous results rather than redo the calculation; but as the situation becomes more complicated, this rapidly becomes increasingly difficult to do.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As we have seen, technical problems in simulations can give results that are not merely wrong in detail, but physically nonsensical.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Simulation is effective for automated physical reasoning when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of scales involved, both temporal and spatial, is not extreme.</a>
