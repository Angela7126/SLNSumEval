<a href="#0" id="0">Sense inventories A sense inventory represents a predefined set of concepts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Two major schools of thought emerge in the literature: the first option, which we adopt in our work, is to use all the Wikipedia pages, redirections and categories to form the sense inventory.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We provide a novel algorithm for inducing a taxonomy of Wikipedia pages and of Wikipedia categories.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Starting from the raw dump of the English Wikipedia, this is performed in three steps.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first step produces a first taxonomy for the page side of Wikipedia; the second step, starting from a noisy category graph, iteratively isolates hypernyms for Wikipedia categories by discriminating is-a relations from general relations thanks to cross-links; the third step refines the bitaxonomy, improving the overall coverage, by solving structural flaws in the page and category graphs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Exploiting global features (F-IDF strategy) There is still a non-negligible fraction of Wikipedia WEE pages which, however, are as yet in their early stage of development, and thus suffer from lack of content.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, more than 30% of Italian WEE pages lack a Wikipedia category, and 25% of these do not even have a definition.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note that the first strategy above cannot be applied to this class of pages, since there is no English equivalent.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The TT and SISTER strategies are, instead, applicable: however, the former is effective only when some translation (provided by the TT) is contained in the textual definition of the target page {a mathematical formula}pF, while the latter is applicable only on those pages which have categories related to the hypernym lemma to be discovered, i.e., such that they bring in sister pages with a valid hypernym lemma.</a>
