<a href="#0" id="0">Source instances {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ are indistinguishable for an ontology {a mathematical formula}O and mappings {a mathematical formula}M if, for every CQ q over the global schema, the certain answers to q over {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D) and {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D ′ ) coincide.The associated decision problem for an ontology language {a mathematical formula}O and mapping language {a mathematical formula}M is defined as follows, where {a mathematical formula}O ranges over {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M over {a mathematical formula}M: {an inline-figure} is true if and only if {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ are indistinguishable for {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M. We consider not only the combined complexity of {an inline-figure}, but also its data complexity — that is, the complexity under assumption that {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M are fixed, while only {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ form the input.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{an inline-figure} is true if and only if {an inline-figure} is true for all source instances {a mathematical formula}D; and</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{an inline-figure} is true if and only if {an inline-figure} is true for all source instances {a mathematical formula}D.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, according to Case (3) (either (a) or (b)), the indistinguishability problem is in {an inline-figure} for standard OBDA settings, where mappings are GAV and the ontology is in DL-Lite{a mathematical formula}R (it is in {an inline-figure} in data complexity by Case (3b) of Theorem 10).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Second, Cases (2) and (3) can be relativised in a similar way as Cases (2) and (3) of Theorem 10; for example, if CQ entailment is in a complexity class {a mathematical formula}C for {a mathematical formula}O and {an inline-figure}, then {an inline-figure} is in the class {an inline-figure}.</a>
