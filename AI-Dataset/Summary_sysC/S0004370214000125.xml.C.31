<a href="#1" id="1">This paper uses numerical constraint programming in order to compute, with full certification, subsets of the different aspects, called connected sets of nonsingular configurations (CSNC) in the following.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The standard branch and prune algorithm is adapted in such a way that solving the robot kinematic model together with non-singularity constraints leads to the enclosure depicted in the right hand side graphic of Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Each solution box is certifiably crossed by a single aspect which covers the whole box projection on the x subspace, and each pair of neighbor solution boxes are certified to share a common solution.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, the connected components {a mathematical formula}A1,A2,A3,A4 of the computed boxes shown in the right hand side graphic of Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">2 allow separating the four aspects, and provide, by projection, inner approximations of the nonsingular workspace of this robot.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The proposed method for the generalized aspect computation relies on solving the following NCSP whose solutions are the nonsingular configurations of the robot:{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula} Î£ ([x],[q]) be the solution set of this NCSP.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our method computes a set of boxes partly covering this solution set.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This set of boxes is partitioned into subsets that represent fully certified approximations of the aspects of the considered robot, in terms of both solution existence and connectedness within the solution set.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The computed boxes have to satisfy the specific properties stated in Section 4.1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The corresponding branch and prune instantiation is described in Section 4.2.</a>
