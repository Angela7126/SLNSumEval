<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}V={v1,v2,v3,v4} be a set of data points and consider the similarity matrix given in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">3 on the left.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">3(right) illustrates one possible solution cl to the correlation clustering problem for this input data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Theorem 2</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The fact that {a mathematical formula}cl Τ is well-defined follows from the observation that each point gets assigned to at most one cluster and each iteration of the procedure assigns at least one point to a cluster.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Furthermore, the hard transitivity constraints in {a mathematical formula}F1 ensure that the intended semantics of the {a mathematical formula}xij variables hold in {a mathematical formula}cl Τ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence it follows that the optimal solutions of {a mathematical formula}F1 correspond to the optimal clusterings of V. The correctness of the transitive encoding can be formalized as follows.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Given a set V of data points and a symmetric similarity matrix W over V, let{a mathematical formula}F1be the MaxSAT instance produced by the transitive encoding on W. The clustering{a mathematical formula}cl Τ ⁎ :V → Nconstructed from an optimal solution{a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ to{a mathematical formula}F1is an optimal clustering of V. A detailed proof of the theorem is given in Appendix A.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Using the auxiliary variables, the soft constraint expressing that the points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj are assigned to the same cluster can be encoded as the clause{a mathematical formula} For some intuition, we note that if this clause is satisfied in a solution Τ , then for some k, {a mathematical formula} Τ (Aijk)=1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Since all hard clauses are satisfied in any solution, it follows that points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj will be assigned to cluster k, exactly as required.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Similarly, if points {a mathematical formula}vi and {a mathematical formula}vj are not assigned to the same cluster, then due to the hard constraints we have {a mathematical formula} Τ (Aijk)=0 for all k, and the soft clause will not be satisfied.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Each unsatisfied clause must increase the cost of a MaxSAT solution according to the similarity values of the corresponding points, which is why the weight of the clause is set to {a mathematical formula}W(i,j).</a>
