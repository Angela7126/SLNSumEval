<a href="#0" id="0">We denote the social welfare of the coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A) by {a mathematical formula}SW(P) (see, e.g., [35]):{a mathematical formula} When we need to explicitly identify the edges of the social network E (with the corresponding weight function) in a social welfare computation, we will write {a mathematical formula}SW(P,E).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As in case 1, since our k-cut is minimal we obtain a coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare.Case 3: there are more than {a mathematical formula}k − 1 negative edges.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The algorithm then finds the optimal coalition structure, denoted {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ , in the temporary graph (line 2), which is possible to do in polynomial time according to Corollary 2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The algorithm concludes that the optimal edges to add to G are all the edges that are within a coalition in {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ (line 3), and the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare in G after adding the edges in {a mathematical formula}E+ is {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to prove the correctness, we first show that {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare in G, after adding the edges in {a mathematical formula}E+.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Indeed, given a coalition structure P in {a mathematical formula}G ′ , every edge from {a mathematical formula}E+ ′ within a coalition {a mathematical formula}C ∈ P contributes {a mathematical formula}2 − Α to the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In Section 3.3 we showed that the running time of the optimal algorithm on nearly positive graphs is consistent with the theoretical complexity analysis of {a mathematical formula}O(nk2), i.e., exponential in k. Moreover, as we have already explained, it is unlikely to find an optimal algorithm with a running time that is polynomial in k. From a practical standpoint, it is still important to find a good coalition structure even where k is not small.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For a social network with general negative and positive weights,K-C-Membershipis co-NP-complete, for every fixed{a mathematical formula}k>2.First we show membership in co-NP by showing that the complement problem, i.e., determining that P is not a member of the k-coalitions-core, is in NP.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}Sa(B)= Σ b ∈ B Ω (a,b) – the sum of weights between a node a and all nodes in the set B.We begin by proving that the contribution to the social welfare of the edges that are changed by a deviation from one coalition structure,</a>
