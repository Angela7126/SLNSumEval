<a href="#0" id="0">RSDA-RQ always produces a feasible and fair matching.Assume that {a mathematical formula}X ′ , which is the matching obtained by RSDA-RQ, is not feasible.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By the definition of the generalized DA mechanism, {a mathematical formula}X ′ is semi-school-feasible.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, the only possibility that {a mathematical formula}X ′ is not feasible is that some student s is not assigned to any school.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since {a mathematical formula}X ′ is semi-school-feasible, we can choose a contract {a mathematical formula}x=(s,c) such that {a mathematical formula}X ′ ∪ {x} is semi-school-feasible.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, it is clear that {a mathematical formula}x ∈ ChS(X ′ ∪ {x}) and {a mathematical formula}x ∈ ChC(X ′ ∪ {x}) hold.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This contradicts the fact that {a mathematical formula}X ′ is HM-stable.Assume {a mathematical formula}X ′ is not fair.</a>
