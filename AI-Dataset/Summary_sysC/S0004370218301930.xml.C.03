<a href="#0" id="0">In the “ best-shot ” public goods game each player chooses an action {a mathematical formula}vi ∈ Vi where the set of possible actions is {a mathematical formula}Vi={T,F}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Taking the action by player i comes with a cost {a mathematical formula}0<Ci<1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the player is taking the action and has exactly l neighbors that also invest in the local public good, then the player's state is {a mathematical formula}Tl.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the simplified version the costs for taking the action are equal for all players (i.e., {a mathematical formula} ∀ i ∈ N,Ci=C) and the number of public goods that each player can benefit from accessing to is limited to 1 (i.e., {a mathematical formula}K=1).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A player in state {a mathematical formula}Fl<K would prefer to change her strategy to T, whereas a player in state {a mathematical formula}Tl ≥ K would prefer to change her strategy to F.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider a global function of the form{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Φ i(v) denotes the share of player i in the global potential function in outcome v. An intuitive and simple version of {a mathematical formula} Φ i(v) was proposed for the simplified version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game in a former paper [8]:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The other state transition that improves the utility of a player, from {a mathematical formula}F1 to {a mathematical formula}T1; results in a change of {a mathematical formula}b − Δ − a to the potential share of player i that changed her strategy.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This follows from the fact that the change to the potential share the player i that changed her strategy is {a mathematical formula}a − b+2 ⋅ Δ and the player has exactly two neighbors performing action, each of which adds Δ to her share in the global potential.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, this is the state with the lowest social welfare out of all PNEs, because in the stable state the utility of a player in state {a mathematical formula}Tl is lower than the utility of a player in state {a mathematical formula}Fl.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In such a case, the change in the global potential, is {a mathematical formula}b − a − 2 ⋅ l ⋅ Δ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For this case the optimal outcome has a social welfare of {a mathematical formula}2 ⋅ K ⋅ (K − C)+(|N| − 2 ⋅ K) ⋅ K.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore, the maximal payoff that player i will be willing to secure for player j is {a mathematical formula}Ci.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">According to Equation (22), only players in state {a mathematical formula}F1 can propose payoff transfers to players in state {a mathematical formula}Tl ≥ 1.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">According to Algorithm 1 a player i will change its strategy if either {a mathematical formula}statei(v)=F0 or {a mathematical formula}statei(v)=Tl ≥ 1 ∧ Ci> − Τ i(v) (lines 2 and 7 respectively).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, only these cases will be considered.Suppose that player i's state is {a mathematical formula}F0.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Therefore, the change in social welfare resulting from i's deviation, will be {a mathematical formula}Ci − ∑ j ∈ Ni|statej(v)=F11.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Therefore, if player i that is currently in state {a mathematical formula}T1, deviates from F to T, then eventually the social welfare will increase.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Therefore, the state of the players at {a mathematical formula}v ⁎ will be either {a mathematical formula}Fl ≥ 1 or {a mathematical formula}Tl ≥ 0.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Having considered all possible states of player i in outcome {a mathematical formula}v ⁎ , it holds that {a mathematical formula}v ⁎ is side-payments enforceable.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The function {a mathematical formula}onStrategySelect() of Algorithm 2 is executed by each player according to some fixed predefined order.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Additionally, the use of an admissible payoff transfer function is assumed.The first player that invokes function {a mathematical formula}onStrategySelect() is player 1.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The state of the player is {a mathematical formula}T2, because exactly two of its neighbors chose T as their action.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Consider now the replies of players 1 and 4, which are both at state {a mathematical formula}F2 at this stage.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">According to these replies, the net gain of player 2 is greater/equal to {a mathematical formula}C (i.e., {a mathematical formula} − Τ 2(v) ≥ C).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The state of player 3 is {a mathematical formula}T2 which leads to four messages strategy-change to be sent to players {a mathematical formula}1,2,4 and 6.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">4b).Note that the social welfare of the initial outcome is {a mathematical formula}8 ⋅ 2 − 6 ⋅ C; this is due to the fact that each player has at least two neighbors taking the action and there are six players with strategy {a mathematical formula}vi=T.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The social welfare of the outcome yielded by Algorithm 2 is {a mathematical formula}8 ⋅ 2 − 4 ⋅ C, which is higher.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Note that according to Algorithm 2, transfers of payoffs should only be proposed to players with {a mathematical formula}statei(v)=Tl ≥ K.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Reconsider the outcome {a mathematical formula}v ⁎ of Example 1 as yielded by Algorithm 2 (Fig.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">However, for general PGGs with {a mathematical formula}K=3 the improvement in social welfare obtained by Algorithm 2 is quite close to that of the best PNEs (Fig.</a>
