<a href="#0" id="0">In [10] the postulates (that we recalled in Subsection 2.2) proposed in [6] for shielded contractions on belief sets were adapted to the belief bases context: Relative success:{a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α =A or {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ Cn(A ∼ Α ).Persistence:If {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β , then {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α ⊢ Β .Success propagation:If {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β and {a mathematical formula} ⊢ Β → Α , then {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α ⊢ Α .Conjunctive constancy:If {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α =A ∼ Β =A, then {a mathematical formula}A ∼ ( Α ∧ Β )=A.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We note that, if {a mathematical formula}R ≠ L satisfies non-retractability propagation, then it is not logically closed i.e., the fact that {a mathematical formula}R ⊢ Α does not imply that {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To see this it is enough to note that if {a mathematical formula}p ∈ R and {a mathematical formula}q ∉ R, then {a mathematical formula}R ⊢ p ∨ q.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">But, by non-retractability propagation, {a mathematical formula}p ∨ q ∉ R.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Definition 3.1 we have introduced, from a constructive perspective, the concept of shielded base contraction induced by a contraction operator ÷ and a set of retractable sentences R. At this point we notice that if, alternatively, we wished to define shielded base contractions in terms of postulates then, having in mind (i) the definition for contraction recalled in Definition 2.5, and (ii) the postulates for shielded contraction presented in Subsections 2.3 and 2.4, the most natural proposal would be to define a shielded base contraction as an operator that satisfies the postulates of relative success and inclusion.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">an operator ÷ that satisfies success and inclusion) and a set of retractable sentences {a mathematical formula}R ⊆ L (which is not required to satisfy any properties at all) does not satisfy the postulate of relative success.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A shielded base contraction ∼ on a belief base A induced by a contraction ÷ and a set {a mathematical formula}R ⊆ L is a basic shielded contraction if and only if ÷ satisfies failure or R satisfies non-retractability of tautology.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By non-retractability preservation{a mathematical formula}L\R ⊆ Cn(A ∼ Β ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Α .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Hence {a mathematical formula} Β ∉ R (otherwise it would follow that {a mathematical formula}A÷ Β ⊢ Β , which contradicts ÷ success).Uniform retractability: Assume that for all subsets {a mathematical formula}A ′ of A, {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊢ Α if and only if {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊢ Β .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Assume that {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ R.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">By non-retractability preservation{a mathematical formula}L\R ⊆ Cn(A ∼ Β ).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Α .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since ∼ is a shielded base contraction it follows that {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊆ A.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Hence, by hypothesis, {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Assume by reductio ad absurdum that {a mathematical formula} Β ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Thus by non-retractability of tautology ⊬ Β .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">On the other hand, by definition of ∼ , {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β =A÷ Β .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Therefore {a mathematical formula}A÷ Β ⊢ Β , which contradicts ÷ success.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Hence if {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ R, then {a mathematical formula} Β ∉ R.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">By symmetry of the case it holds that if {a mathematical formula} Β ∉ R, then {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ R.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Hence {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ R if and only if {a mathematical formula} Β ∈ R.Retractability of logical equivalents: Follows by Observation 3.4 since, as shown above, R satisfies uniform retractability.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Let {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ R and {a mathematical formula} Β ∉ R.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">It follows by definition of R that {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α ⊢ Α and {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β .</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Hence, by ∼ relative success, {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α =A ∼ Β =A.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Thus, by ∼ conjunctive constancy{a mathematical formula}A ∼ ( Α ∧ Β )=A, from which it follows that {a mathematical formula}A ∼ ( Α ∧ Β ) ⊢ Α ∧ Β .</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Therefore {a mathematical formula} Α ∧ Β ∉ R.Assume that ∼ that satisfies persistence.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">We will show that R satisfies non-retractability preservation, conjunctive completeness, non-retractability propagation and retractability of logical equivalents.Non-retractability preservation: Let Α be an arbitrary sentence and {a mathematical formula} Β ∈ L\R.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Hence {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β .</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">By persistence{a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α ⊢ Β .</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Thus {a mathematical formula}L\R ⊆ {a mathematical formula}Cn(A ∼ Α ).Conjunctive completeness: Let {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ R and {a mathematical formula} Β ∉ R.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Hence, by definition of R, {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α ⊢ Α and {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β .</a>
