<a href="#0" id="0">However, for the purpose of showing the connection of our algorithms to the theory of [17] we prescribe preferred labellings that basically correspond to preferred extensions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the latter case ({a mathematical formula} Μ ′ (z)=MUST_OUT), we have (from line 23) a contradiction to S having been reported as a potentially admissible set in PEXT: S can only be added if there is no {a mathematical formula}w ∈ A labelled MUST_OUT.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This observation suffices to deal with the case that {a mathematical formula} Μ ′ (z)is in {a mathematical formula}{UNDEC,BLANK} for again such z will be labelled MUST_OUT (line 11).Our analysis of the preceding paragraph establishes that every {a mathematical formula}S ∈ PEXT is admissible.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From the actions of line 14 in Algorithm 2 this implies that there exists an admissible set {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊃ S s.t.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In fact, {a mathematical formula}U ′ is the set of total orders that Algorithm 5 investigates for enumerating preferred extensions as we will establish later.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Assume{a mathematical formula} By Algorithm 5, lines 12 and 14{a mathematical formula} By Proposition 5 (which basically states the conditions under which an argument is labelled IN or left BLANK by Algorithm 6) and after simplification{a mathematical formula} This contradicts the definition of {a mathematical formula}U ′ (Definition 7): recall that {a mathematical formula}U ′ contains total value orders including those which satisfy the previous implication.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Their dialog process is basically centered around the following property: given an argument x, then x is skeptically accepted if and only if{a mathematical formula} In [25] Doutre and Mengin did not give an algorithm for constructing their dialectical proof.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The bottom line is, our approach is faster than any other mechanism that would consider every specific audience {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ U while our algorithms only consider critical audiences {a mathematical formula}U ′ ⊆ U as stated by Proposition 4, which is a key contribution of our algorithms.</a>
