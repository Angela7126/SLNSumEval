<a href="#0" id="0">A final contribution of our work is the development of two specific Horn revision operators, called basic Horn revision and canonical Horn revision, with polynomial time complexity ({a mathematical formula}O(n) and {a mathematical formula}O(n2log ⁡ n) respectively).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Models of Horn formulas are distinguished by the fact that they are closed under intersection of positive atoms in an interpretation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is:{a mathematical formula} Note that the converse is also true; i.e., if a set of models W is closed under intersection of positive atoms in an interpretation, then there is a Horn formula Φ such that {a mathematical formula}[ Φ ]=W.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In a finite language (which is what is assumed in the Katsuno and Mendelzon approach) it is straightforward to determine the relative position of two possible worlds, {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2: Simply determine the result of revising by a formula with models given by {a mathematical formula}{w1,w2}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">1 suffices to show this: Defining revision according to Definition 2 yields a revision function that satisfies (H*1) – (H*8) (see Proposition 1) and yet violates (Acyc) (simply consider the revisions by the Horn formulas {a mathematical formula} Μ 0=r, {a mathematical formula} Μ 1=q, and {a mathematical formula} Μ 2=p).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As mentioned in the beginning of the proof, the next step is to define an extension of {a mathematical formula} ⪯ ⁎ which is total, and preserves the Μ -minimal worlds, for all Horn formulas Μ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this section, we take advantage of this feature of Horn logic, and develop two specific Horn revision operators, called basic and canonical revision, which also have polynomial time complexity; in particular, {a mathematical formula}O(n) and {a mathematical formula}O(n2log ⁡ n) respectively.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We define the basic Horn ranking associated with H, denoted ⪯ , as follows:{a mathematical formula} This ordering reflects an intuition deriving from the logic programming community, that an atom is false unless it is (depending on the underlying approach) “ required ” to be true.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">An immediate consequence of the above result is that, for any consistent Horn formula Μ , there is only one smallest Μ -world (in terms of cardinality); namely the world {a mathematical formula}w Μ as defined in Proposition 5.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus {a mathematical formula}w ∈ [(H Μ ∪ Μ )].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This proves {a mathematical formula}min ⁡ ([ Μ ], ⪯ ) ⊆ [(H Μ ∪ Μ )].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For the converse, assume that w is a world in {a mathematical formula}[(H Μ ∪ Μ )].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Then w is a Μ -world that is also a model of {a mathematical formula}H Μ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Consider now any world {a mathematical formula}w ′ ∈ [ Μ ] and assume that {a mathematical formula}w ′ is a model of some fallback set {a mathematical formula}Hi; i.e.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">{a mathematical formula}w ′ ∈ [Hi].</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Since {a mathematical formula}H Μ is the first fallback set consistent with Μ , it follows that {a mathematical formula}Hi doesn't appear earlier than {a mathematical formula}H Μ in the sequence of fallback sets.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Moreover, since fallback sets become progressively (logically) weaker, and given that {a mathematical formula}w ∈ [H Μ ], it follows that {a mathematical formula}w ∈ [Hi].</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Assume that the set {a mathematical formula}P of propositional variables has m elements, and let k be the number of Horn clauses of the initial belief base {a mathematical formula}H0.</a>
