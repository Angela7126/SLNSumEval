<a href="#0" id="0">We can express the problem to make plain this distinction thus:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The nature of this similarity may be determined by a number of methods, many of which might associate visual or geometric features to points in a coordinate space, and compute similarity as a distance metric.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Stated formally:{a mathematical formula} where{a mathematical formula} One computationally inexpensive way to achieve such a constrained partitioning is to impose upon the image B a uniform, rectilinear grid, and select the subimages based upon some chosen grid size, as expressed in units of pixels.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, a stronger specification of the fractal encoding T may be thought of as a function of three variables, the source image A, the target image B, and the partitioning scheme P:{a mathematical formula} where the cardinality of the resulting set is determined solely by the partitioning P. That is, each subimage {a mathematical formula}bi that P extracts from B will be represented by exactly one element of the set T.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have found that significant discrimination between candidate answers may be found by using the Jaccard similarity; that is, by setting {a mathematical formula} Α ← Β ← 1.0, and thus favoring features from either transformation equally.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As Tversky notes, by equating Α and Β , we ensure that the calculation of similarity is symmetric with respect to the transformations under comparison.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this example, the problem is to determine for which of the candidate images the transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ is made most analogous to transformation T. We first will represent T as a fractal representation, and then generate a set of candidate transformations Ω as shown in Fig.</a>
