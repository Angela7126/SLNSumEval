<a href="#0" id="0">This problem has six variable symmetries (including identity):{a mathematical formula} i.e., {a mathematical formula} Σ =S3.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">noted that when {a mathematical formula} Σ =Sn, the n!</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}L Σ (x)) the solution set of a lex constraint breaking a symmetry Σ (resp.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}lex Σ (x) ⟹ rlex Σ (x).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For each {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ Σ we thus have {a mathematical formula}y Σ ˆ <y Σ ˆ Σ and {a mathematical formula}x Σ ˆ ≤ x Σ ˆ Σ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As rlex is a relaxation of lex, we have {a mathematical formula}L Σ (x) ⊆ R Σ (x).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence rlex are SBCs in {a mathematical formula}H ‾ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The number of symmetric points of x satisfying rlex constraints is {a mathematical formula}|R Σ (x Σ )|, and we denote by {a mathematical formula}|x Σ |=|{x Σ : Σ ∈ Σ }| the number of different elements in the symmetry class of x.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since {a mathematical formula} Σ 1 is the only permutation of x that is accepted by rlex, no other permutation can yield the same result as {a mathematical formula} Σ 1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">When the rlex associated to {a mathematical formula} Σ − 1 is applied to {a mathematical formula}x Σ it results in {a mathematical formula}x Σ ⪯ lex(x Σ ) Σ − 1 ≡ x Σ ⪯ lexx.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We can divide the set of {a mathematical formula}rlex Σ constraints into two subsets.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The conclusion is that all {a mathematical formula}rlex Σ constraints are satisfied at {a mathematical formula}x Σ and at x, thus its class is not optimal.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">It belongs to a class with less than {a mathematical formula}| Σ | members.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Some of its symmetries are not broken by {a mathematical formula}rlex Σ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Thus, if a problem has only interior solutions the above ratio is {a mathematical formula}| Σ |.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Moreover, in most cases they have a gain not too far from {a mathematical formula}| Σ |.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">There are problems with no solution prevalence or without solutions at all in which gains are very different from {a mathematical formula}| Σ |.</a>
