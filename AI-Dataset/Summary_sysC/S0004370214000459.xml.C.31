<a href="#1" id="1">There exist CQs q and sets Σ of OWL 2 QL-tgds any UCQ-rewritings of which have{a mathematical formula} Ω (K Σ |q|)CQs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section, given a family of monotone Boolean functions {a mathematical formula}fn in NP, we first encode them — via the Tseitin transformation [59] — by means of polynomial-size CNFs, which are used to construct a sequence of OWL 2 QL-ontologies {a mathematical formula} Σ fn and Boolean CQs {a mathematical formula}qfn such that{a mathematical formula} where the database instance {a mathematical formula}D Α is determined by Α .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then, using the fact that the {a mathematical formula}D Α have a single domain element, we show that if we have, say, PE-rewritings of the {a mathematical formula}qfn and {a mathematical formula} Σ fn, then those rewritings are in essence monotone Boolean formulas (that is, propositional PE-formulas), and so, by the known results on circuit complexity, cannot be polynomial, for example, in the case of the family of Boolean functions that check whether a given graph (encoded by arguments of the functions) contains a clique of the specified size.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If{a mathematical formula}qfn ′ is an FO-rewriting of{a mathematical formula}qfnand{a mathematical formula} Σ fn, then there is a Boolean formula{a mathematical formula} Φ ncomputing{a mathematical formula}fnwith{a mathematical formula}| Φ n| ≤ |qfn ′ |.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If{a mathematical formula}qfn ′ is a PE-rewriting of{a mathematical formula}qfnand{a mathematical formula} Σ fn, then there is a monotone Boolean formula{a mathematical formula} Φ ncomputing{a mathematical formula}fnwith{a mathematical formula}| Φ n| ≤ |qfn ′ |.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We say that a family of ontologies has the polynomial witness property (PWP, for short) if there is a polynomial {a mathematical formula}d(m,n) such that, for any ontology Σ in the family, any CQ {a mathematical formula}q(x) and any data instance D, whenever {a mathematical formula}( Σ ,D) ⊨ q(a), for a tuple a from {a mathematical formula} Δ D, then there is a sequence of {a mathematical formula}d(|q|,| Σ |) applications of tgds from Σ to D that entails {a mathematical formula}q(a) (in the sense that there is a homomorphism from {a mathematical formula}q(a) to the set of atoms generated by those tgd applications).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Lemma 15</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider a family {a mathematical formula}f1,f2, … of monotone Boolean functions in NP and a corresponding family {a mathematical formula}C1,C2, … of polynomial-size Boolean circuits with nondeterministic inputs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Recall that in Section 3 we constructed a family {a mathematical formula} Ψ n of CNFs encoding the {a mathematical formula}Cn.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The CNF {a mathematical formula} Ψ n, which contains {a mathematical formula}d ≤ 3|Cn|+1 clauses with {a mathematical formula}m=|Cn| Boolean variables, was then transformed into a set {a mathematical formula} Σ fn of OWL 2 QL-tgds and a Boolean CQ {a mathematical formula}qfn such that{a mathematical formula} Consider now the OWL 2 QL-ontology {a mathematical formula} Σ fn ⁎ that extends {a mathematical formula} Σ fn with the negative constraints{a mathematical formula} where Θ is the set comprising the following formulas:{a mathematical formula} We observe that {a mathematical formula}| Σ fn ⁎ |=O(|Cn|2) and the claims of Lemma 8 are equally applicable to {a mathematical formula} Σ fn ⁎ (the proof requires that the query {a mathematical formula}qfn and the ontology {a mathematical formula} Σ fn/ Σ fn ⁎ give ‘ correct ’ answers only for data {a mathematical formula}D Α which, by definition, are consistent with the negative constraints above).</a>
