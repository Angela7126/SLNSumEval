<a href="#0" id="0">We present an approach to hybrid task and motion planning, in which state-based forward-chaining task planning is tightly coupled with motion planning and other forms of geometric reasoning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our approach is centered around the problem of geometric backtracking that arises in hybrid task and motion planning: in order to satisfy the geometric preconditions of the current action, a planner may need to reconsider geometric choices, such as grasps and poses, that were made for previous actions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This paper describes a hybrid planner that reasons both at the task level and at the geometric level.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">we present a combined task – motion planning algorithm that implements geometric backtracking;</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In these approaches, a task plan is generated, and some of the actions involve motion planning problems which are solved by dedicated motion planners or other geometric reasoners.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Each motion planning problem is solved immediately, when the action is applied by the task planner.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If the motion planner fails, it can add constraints to the task planning problem.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In panel d, with task planning followed by motion planning, more symbolic states are explored, as there is no early geometric pruning, but on the other hand the effort on the geometric level is reduced.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our combined task and motion planner utilizes a hybrid state representation, where certain predicates are evaluated as usual in the symbolic state component, but other predicates are evaluated in the geometric component.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">6 shows a simple motion planning problem in {a mathematical formula}C=R2 where a robot has to move from {a mathematical formula}qinit to {a mathematical formula}qgoal.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}C is expressed with four parameters for each motion planning problem.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">A hybrid planning problem is a tuple {a mathematical formula}Pb= 〈 s0,D,g 〉 , where: {a mathematical formula}s0=(syms0,geos0) is the initial state consisting of a symbolic state {a mathematical formula}syms0 and a geometric state {a mathematical formula}geos0; D is a hybrid planning domain; and g is a goal formula.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">A solution to a hybrid planning problem is a hybrid plan P that is valid when starting from {a mathematical formula}s0, and for which g holds in the final state {a mathematical formula}sn.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Algorithm 4 (searchGeomSeq) visits alternative geometric instantiations of the selected actions in {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">It takes the earliest action in {a mathematical formula}A and samples possible geometric bindings for the geometric parts of its preconditions (line 5).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In {a mathematical formula}i29a, the motion planner is called 12 times both with and without constraint propagation.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The planner queries the world model in order to get geometric information about the planning problem addressed.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The fourth heuristic is {a mathematical formula}fselCOLL ▹ fselREVCHRONO, which realizes our geometric backtracking approach.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Using {a mathematical formula}fselCOLL alone, the search would be incomplete; but the composite function {a mathematical formula}fselCOLL ▹ fselREVCHRONO provides a full geometric backtracking.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The last heuristic is {a mathematical formula}fselREVCHRONO, which results in performing a complete search with full geometric backtracking (see Section 4) since every previous action is possibly selected.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The planner performing full geometric backtracking is guided towards solution plans that contain most often four actions (68% of the solution plans for {a mathematical formula}fselREVCHRONO).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Second, considering the combined symbolic and geometric search as a whole, there is a need for more closely controlling the interaction between task and motion planning.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Fourth, motion planning is an expensive search process, and it is performed many times during geometric backtracking.</a>
