<a href="#0" id="0">Suppose {a mathematical formula}F() is the fractal encoding of image B.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a target image B and a source image A, the fractal encoding algorithm seeks to discover this particular set of transformations T.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, a stronger specification of the fractal encoding T may be thought of as a function of three variables, the source image A, the target image B, and the partitioning scheme P:{a mathematical formula} where the cardinality of the resulting set is determined solely by the partitioning P. That is, each subimage {a mathematical formula}bi that P extracts from B will be represented by exactly one element of the set T.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The partitioning scheme P extracts a set of images {a mathematical formula}bi from the target image B.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The fractal encoding algorithm seeks to find the best matching fragment in a source image that corresponds to a given image partitioned from the target image.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The fractal encoding algorithm prescribes that the dilation factor to be used when searching may be conveniently set as {a mathematical formula}r=0.5.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For each image {a mathematical formula}bi taken from a partitioning of the target image B, the fractal encoding algorithm locates, via exhaustive search over the source image A, a corresponding fragment {a mathematical formula}ak which the algorithm has deemed to be most minimally distant photometrically under a discovered transformation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let us label the representation of the fractal transformation from image A to image B as {a mathematical formula}TAB.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this example, the problem is to determine for which of the candidate images the transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ is made most analogous to transformation T. We first will represent T as a fractal representation, and then generate a set of candidate transformations Ω as shown in Fig.</a>
