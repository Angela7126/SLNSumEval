<a href="#0" id="0">In GPL, this can be achieved by putting a negation in front of PL formulas: {a mathematical formula}¬N1( Α ) expresses that we know that the agent does not believe in the truth of Α ,{sup:1} whereas situations where we have no such knowledge are encoded by GPL theories which have models in which {a mathematical formula}N1( Α ) is true and models in which {a mathematical formula}N1( Α ) is false.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is not a real restriction, since knowledge bases only have finitely many formulas in practice, which means that only finitely many certainty levels actually need to be used, and since the semantics of GPL is based on the relative ordering of the certainty degrees, we can then always map these certainty degrees to {a mathematical formula} Λ k for some k. In Section 5, however, we will discuss an extension of GPL in which we can express comparative uncertainty statements, where it will be desirable to allow an unbounded number of certainty degrees at the semantic level.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using Proposition 1, and some well-known properties on necessity and possibility measures, it follows that the following formulas are theorems in GPL:{a mathematical formula} Next is a counterpart to the modus ponens rule in PL (4):{a mathematical formula} To show that this is a theorem in GPL, thanks to Proposition 1, it suffices to note that every necessity measure N satisfying {a mathematical formula}N( Α ) ≥ Λ 1 and {a mathematical formula}N(¬ Α ∨ Β ) ≥ Λ 2 also satisfies {a mathematical formula}N( Β ) ≥ min ⁡ ( Λ 1, Λ 2), which is equivalent to the usual modus ponens in PL, a special case of (4).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Likewise, the axiom {a mathematical formula} □ p → ◇ p (axiom D in modal logic systems) may encode the inequality {a mathematical formula}N(A) ≤ Π (A), and the characteristic axiom of necessity measures {a mathematical formula}N(A ∩ B)=min ⁡ (N(A),N(B)) corresponds to the theorem {a mathematical formula}( □ p ∧ □ q) ↔ □ (p ∧ q) which is valid in modal system K. Nevertheless, no formally established connection between modal logic and possibility theory existed until the late 1980s.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In fact, the soundness and completeness result from Proposition 1 can straightforwardly be adapted to a logic centered on the Δ modality, by taking advantage of the following duality:{a mathematical formula} where the possibility distribution {a mathematical formula} Π ‾ is defined as {a mathematical formula} Π ‾ ( Ω )=1 − Π ( Ω ) for all {a mathematical formula} Ω ∈ Ω .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We can furthermore show that the following formulas are valid in GPL:{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Note that (16) is the counterpart of a basic inference rule of the logic of accumulated data [50].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note in particular that, unlike in GPL{a mathematical formula} ≻ core, the semantics considered in [7] is not based on necessity measures.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This common core of conclusions is captured by the inference rules of System P [5]:{a mathematical formula} The last two inference rules correspond to the idea of cumulativity, whereby {a mathematical formula} Α ∧ Β | ∼ Γ and {a mathematical formula} Α | ∼ Γ are equivalent if {a mathematical formula} Α | ∼ Β is taken for granted.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If we only consider conditionals {a mathematical formula} Α | ∼ Β for which {a mathematical formula} Α ⊭ ⊥ , the conclusions that System P allows us to derive from the rule base R can be characterized using possibility theory.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It turns out that in general, if we restrict our attention to minimally specific Boolean e-models of GPL formulas of this type with {a mathematical formula}k=2, we obtain a semantics for reasoning from the absence of information, which captures the stable model semantics of answer set programs.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Moreover, as in the proof of Proposition 14, without loss of generality, we can assume that the only meta-literals which occur in this meta-term are of the form {a mathematical formula}N Λ 1( Α 1) and {a mathematical formula} Δ Μ 1( Β 1), by refining any meta-literals of the form {a mathematical formula} Π Λ 1( Α 1) and {a mathematical formula} ∇ Μ 1( Β 1).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Assume that we guess a meta-term of the following form:{a mathematical formula} Using an NP-oracle we can check that this formula is consistent, verifying that {a mathematical formula} Α 1 ∧ ... ∧ Α n is consistent, and that {a mathematical formula} Β i ⊨ Α j whenever {a mathematical formula} Μ i ≥ Ν ( Λ j).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If the meta-term is consistent, it has a unique least specific e-model {a mathematical formula} Π 1, which is the least specific e-model of {a mathematical formula}N Λ 1( Α 1) ∧ ... ∧ N Λ n( Α n), noting that the latter corresponds to a standard possibilistic logic base.Using the NP-oracle we can check that Β is false in {a mathematical formula} Π 1.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let {a mathematical formula} Ω ⁎ be the set of all propositional interpretations over the set of atomic formulas F. Given a GPL knowledge base K, let {a mathematical formula}K ⁎ be the propositional knowledge base over F, defined as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Α → Β is an arbitrary (but fixed) formula from {a mathematical formula}L which is equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Α → Β , and similarly for ¬ Α .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Before we present the proof of the main result, which will apply to arbitrary propositional combinations of comparative certainty statements, we show that the proposed axioms are sufficient for detecting inconsistencies in sets of statements of the form {a mathematical formula} Α ≻ Β .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Note that the other direction follows trivially from the soundness of the axioms.Since {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊬ ⊥ , it follows from Lemma 4 that the set of conditionals {a mathematical formula}{ Γ 1| ∼ Δ 1,..., Γ m| ∼ Δ m} is consistent.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Given the correspondence between consistent sets of conditionals and possibility theory shown in [57], this means that {a mathematical formula}c( Γ 1| ∼ Δ 1) ∧ ... ∧ c( Γ m| ∼ Δ m) is satisfiable, and in particular that it has an e-model Π such that the conditionals satisfied by Π are exactly those in {a mathematical formula}{ Γ 1| ∼ Δ 1,..., Γ m| ∼ Δ m}, since we assumed that this set is rationally closed.</a>
