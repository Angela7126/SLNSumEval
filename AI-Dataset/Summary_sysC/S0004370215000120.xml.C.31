<a href="#0" id="0">This collection of tracks was the end-result of an attempt to find a balance between the very large number of tracks (pure SAT, pure UNSAT, SAT+UNSAT for each of the categories, Application, Crafted, and Random; and instantiation-specific special tracks) organized in the SAT Competitions, and the strict application orientation of the SAT-Races (only “ industrial ” Application SAT+UNSAT).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the Sequential Portfolio Track, one third of the competition benchmark instances came from each of the three categories Application, Hard Combinatorial, and Random.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Unfortunately, only three solvers participated in this “ mixed ” track, even though we believe the track would have been rather interesting for showcasing the potential of portfolio solvers as generic SAT solvers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">SATzilla2012 ALL, which is optimized for such a mixed set of problem instances, could outperform the other two solvers, solving 17% more instances than the second best solver ppfolio2012.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is noteworthy that the generic mixed heuristics of SATzilla2012 ALL performed quite well also in the tracks specialized on only one category of benchmarks, where it consistently ranked just one place behind the more specialized versions of SATzilla2012, namely SATzilla2012 APP, SATzilla2012 COMB, and SATzilla2012 RAND.</a>
