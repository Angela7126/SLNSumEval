<a href="#0" id="0">A qualitative calculus {a mathematical formula}M provides a constraint language by using formulas of the form {a mathematical formula}(vi Α vj), where Α is a relation in {a mathematical formula}M and {a mathematical formula}vi,vj are variables taking values from the universe of {a mathematical formula}M. Formulas of the form {a mathematical formula}(vi Α vj) are called constraints (over {a mathematical formula}M).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If Α is a basic relation in {a mathematical formula}M, {a mathematical formula}(vi Α vj) is called a basic constraint.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Suppose {a mathematical formula}S is a subset of {a mathematical formula}M. The consistency problem cspsat ({a mathematical formula}S) is defined as follows:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Suppose {a mathematical formula}S is a subset of {a mathematical formula}M. The consistency problem {a mathematical formula}cspsatf(S) is defined as follows, where the subscript ‘ f ’ stands for ‘ finite ’ :</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To determine the computational complexity of reasoning with a qualitative calculus {a mathematical formula}M, we will begin with {a mathematical formula}cspsats(BM).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our computational complexity results are summarised in Table 4, where qualitative calculus {a mathematical formula}M is PA, IA, CRA, RCC5 or RCC8, and {a mathematical formula}S is either {a mathematical formula}BM or {a mathematical formula}M itself (i.e., we consider either complete basic networks or the most general case).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As a direct consequence, we have Assuming that all landmarks are represented by polygons, then the consistency problem{a mathematical formula}cspsats(BRCC5)is in P, and the consistency problems{a mathematical formula}cspsatf(BRCC5),{a mathematical formula}cspsats(RCC5), and{a mathematical formula}cspsatf(RCC5)are all NP-complete.It follows directly from Theorem 9 that {a mathematical formula}cspsats(BRCC5) is in P. Moreover, by Proposition 1 we know that {a mathematical formula}cspsatf(BRCC5), {a mathematical formula}cspsats(RCC5), and {a mathematical formula}cspsatf(RCC5) are all in NP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If all {a mathematical formula}S¯i are given in advance as a constraint for spatial variable {a mathematical formula}vi (i.e., we explicitly specify whether vertex {a mathematical formula}e in the overlay is on the boundary of {a mathematical formula}vi for all {a mathematical formula}e and {a mathematical formula}vi), then the existence of such a solution can be determined in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that each {a mathematical formula}Si has {a mathematical formula}O(K2) points, which are polynomial in the input size.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus guessing a configuration of {a mathematical formula}Si takes polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Meanwhile, checking all the conditions also takes polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore, the extended consistency problem {a mathematical formula}cspsats(BRCC8) is in NP, and hence NP-complete as its NP-hardness has been confirmed in Proposition 9.By Proposition 1 (ii) and (iii) we know {a mathematical formula}cspsatf(BRCC8), {a mathematical formula}cspsats(RCC8), and {a mathematical formula}cspsatf(RCC8) are all in NP.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The consistency problem{a mathematical formula}cspsats(BRCC8 ′ )can be decided in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The computational complexity of {a mathematical formula}cspsats(BRCC8 ′ ) is the same as that of {a mathematical formula}cspsats(BRCC5) (see Theorem 9), as the argument for RCC5 still applies here.</a>
