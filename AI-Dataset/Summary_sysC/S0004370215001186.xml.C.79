<a href="#0" id="0">To explore the addition of multiple relations and its consequences for the dissemination of phenomena in social simulations, we put forward to reduce the emphasis given on agent individual interactions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In an attempt to mimic real social systems, one can also make use of complex network models to create the infrastructure that guides agent interaction (see [4] for an example).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We want to study the consequences of using multiple social networks at the same time while maintaining the interaction model as simple and abstract as possible (following the methodology in most opinion dynamics literature).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One common issue of these models is the fact that once generated, the network structure is static.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From the very beginning, our research questions were focused on the collective properties, the structure of the networks involved, and the dynamical outcomes of the simulations: thus leaving out issues related with individual motivations and desired results (either for any individual agent or the society).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the context switching model [12] (Model 2), agents are embedded in multiple relations (represented as static social networks).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This model describes an abstract way to represent the time spent on each network using the switching probability {a mathematical formula} Ζ Ci.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The small-world networks generated by the models of Watts and Strogatz for instance, model real-world social networks with short average path length, local clustering structures, and triadic closures between the nodes [25].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We show that what is important is not just the number of connections, but the properties of the resulting structure (when we merge the networks).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">One of the characteristics of scale-free networks is its short average path length, thus, for {a mathematical formula}d ≥ 2, adding more edges does not make a significant difference.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We analyse the context permeability model in terms of convergence to consensus: the ratio of simulations that converged to total consensus over 3000 runs; and how many agent encounters were needed for this to happen.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We focus on the k-regular networks with higher values of k. We can see that with these two networks, the configurations with values of {a mathematical formula}d>=2 for scale-free networks produce drastically better results in terms of speed of convergence.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The difference between this model and the previous one is that the agents no longer interact in multiple networks at the same time (being able to select any neighbour at a given simulation step).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For smaller values of k, symmetry in the context switching probability (having the same probability in both networks) is more important if the agent switches less from one of the networks.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Finally, to compare the context switching model with the previous model of context permeability, we froze the switching probabilities with values {a mathematical formula} Ζ =0.25,0.5,0.75 and varied the number of networks.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">When we increase the number of networks ({a mathematical formula}n ≥ 3), the configurations with higher switching probability lead the results to be closer to what happens in context permeability.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The surprise was that for values of {a mathematical formula}k ≥ 20, the results where practically the same for both models independently of the switching probability – even when we increased the number of networks, the number of encounters remained around 2000 on average for all the models.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">It is still important that we get comparable results because we are introducing a temporal component that was never explored before in these types of opinion dynamics models: the fact that the agents can become active in different networks at different points in time.</a>
