<a href="#37" id="37">If an aggregation rule F is such that for every profile E there exists an individual{a mathematical formula}i ⋆ ∈ Nsuch that{a mathematical formula}F(E) ⊆ Ei ⋆ , then F is world collectively rational with respect to all □ -formulas.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Proof</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">First, observe that every conflict-resolving aggregation rule is collectively rational with respect to nontriviality.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">This is straightforward from the definition of being conflict-resolving: Let E be profile of nontrivial graphs.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Then there exist two vertices x and y such that {a mathematical formula}(x,y) ∈ E1, which implies that either {a mathematical formula}(y,x) or {a mathematical formula}(x,y) itself need to be in the collective graph.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">But then the claim is strictly weaker than claiming that, for {a mathematical formula}|V| ⩾ 3, any Arrovian aggregation rule for nontrivial preorders must be dictatorial, which follows from Theorem 16 using the by now familiar approach.</a>
