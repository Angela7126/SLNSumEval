<a href="#0" id="0">[25] presents a general theoretical framework for statistical logical learning based on dynamic propositionalization, where structure learning corresponds to inferring a suitable kernel on logical objects, and parameter learning corresponds to function learning in the resulting reproducing kernel Hilbert space.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This definition allows faster convergence during the training of the model: the classical Fuzzy FOL formulation directly depends only on one item over the set of groundings (the argmin element), whereas the average depends on all elements and allows parallel optimization during training.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is clear from the results that the dom heuristic effectively breaks the learning complexity, allowing to find better solutions.</a>
