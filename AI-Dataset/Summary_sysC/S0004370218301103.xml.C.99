<a href="#0" id="0">SPR problemAn SPR problem is defined by a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,H0 〉 , where L is a plan library and {a mathematical formula}H0 is a set of hypotheses that explain some observation sequence with respect to L. A solution to the SPR problem is an SPR process with a query policy that decides which plans to select in order to reduce the size of {a mathematical formula}H0 with as few queries as possible.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If the query result is False, then the entropy of the resulting hypothesis set is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} Recall that {a mathematical formula} Φ (H,p,False) is the set of all hypotheses such that none of their plans can be refined to be p (Equation (3)).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The Entropy policy will choose the plan that minimizes the change in entropy to the updated hypothesis set, weighted by the likelihood that the plan is part of the correct hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As discussed in Appendix B, we can approximate the likelihood that the plan is part of the correct hypothesis – {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ (p) – by choosing a value between {a mathematical formula}Pr(p) and {a mathematical formula}Pm(p).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, in practice, we implemented the Entropy policy by using {a mathematical formula}Pr(p) and {a mathematical formula}Pm(p) instead of {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ (p) when computing the change in entropy, as follows.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For the Entropy policy, we need to compute for each plan p the entropy of the hypothesis set with and without p. To compute the updated hypothesis set {a mathematical formula} Φ (H,p,True) (Equation (2)) we need to go over all plans in H and check whether they are refinements of p. A naive implementation of checking whether a plan {a mathematical formula}p ′ ∈ H is a refinement of p (Definition 6) is to exhaustively check if there exists a sequence of refinement methods that can be applied to p to obtain {a mathematical formula}p ′ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The transition function {a mathematical formula}Tr(si+1,p,si) is the probability that the set of hypotheses corresponding to the state {a mathematical formula}si+1 is obtained after updating the hypothesis set with respect to the answer to query p, given that the previous set of hypotheses corresponds to the set {a mathematical formula}si.</a>
