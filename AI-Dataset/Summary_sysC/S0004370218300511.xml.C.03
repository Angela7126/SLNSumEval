<a href="#0" id="0">An abstraction of Θ is a surjective function {a mathematical formula} Α :S → S Α mapping {a mathematical formula}S to a set of abstract states, {a mathematical formula}S Α .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Abstraction heuristic [12]Let Α be an abstraction with an associated abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Abstraction heuristics are admissible and consistent, since {a mathematical formula} Θ Α is a homomorphism and, thus, paths in the original state space are preserved in the abstract state space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Every abstraction Α induces an equivalence relation on {a mathematical formula}S, {a mathematical formula} ∼ Α , defined as {a mathematical formula}s ∼ Α t if and only if {a mathematical formula} Α (s)= Α (t), i.e., any two states mapped to the same abstract state are considered to be equivalent by the abstract state space.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, each abstract state {a mathematical formula}si Α may be interpreted as a set of states {a mathematical formula}Si Α such that it contains every state mapped to {a mathematical formula}si Α , i.e., {a mathematical formula}Si Α ={s| Α (s)=si Α }.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let {a mathematical formula} Α 1 and {a mathematical formula} Α 2 be two abstractions of a given state space Θ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Each abstract state is identified with a number, from 0 to {a mathematical formula}| Α | − 1, where {a mathematical formula}| Α | is the number of abstract states in the abstraction.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, abstract state 1 of {a mathematical formula} Π 1 corresponds to having package 1 in the truck.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For example, abstract state 1 of {a mathematical formula} Π 1 ⊗ Π 2 represents states in which package 2 is in the truck and package 1 is at L. The abstraction in Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The shrinking operation (rule S) applies a function Γ that maps the abstract states to a new set of abstract states, producing a new abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α 1.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For each abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α i, we perform a backward uniform-cost search {a mathematical formula}UCSi on its abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α i.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">After constructing a perimeter around the goal, the search frontier is relaxed into an abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Α 1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The algorithm does not only build a single perimeter; whenever the abstract search in {a mathematical formula} Α i becomes intractable, it is relaxed into a coarser abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Α i+1.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Then, each phase i consists of a backward uniform-cost search in the abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α i initialized with the perimeter frontier of search {a mathematical formula}i − 1.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Each table corresponds to an abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α i that considers i variables.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Every level of the ADD corresponds to an intermediate abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α i.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In the last level, terminal ADD nodes correspond to the heuristic value of abstract states of the final M&S abstraction, {a mathematical formula}si Α 5.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Let {a mathematical formula}ADDi,j denote the ADD node that corresponds to the abstract state {a mathematical formula}sj Α i.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Algorithm 3 can be adapted to compute the ADD representation of the M&S abstraction function (that maps states in S to abstract states in {a mathematical formula}Sn Α ) by assigning to terminal nodes the id of each abstract state instead of their heuristic value.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">8a, and an intermediate M&S abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α 2, depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">8b, we derive the corresponding set of states {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S 2(S).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">{a mathematical formula} Α 2 is an M&S abstraction over variables {a mathematical formula} Υ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Υ 2 with two abstract states {a mathematical formula}e0 and {a mathematical formula}e1.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Each abstract state corresponds to an equivalence relation over variables {a mathematical formula} Υ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Υ 2.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">However, in this case, we must iterate over all the abstract states in {a mathematical formula}S Α to keep their information.</a>
