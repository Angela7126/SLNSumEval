<a href="#0" id="0">Our hybrid representation integrates pseudo-tags learned from content into the tag representation of a track, and a dynamic weighting scheme limits the number of pseudo-tags that are allowed to contribute.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show that our approach significantly improves recommendation quality not only for queries with a sparse tag representation but also those that are well-tagged.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our hybrid approach has potential to be extended to other music representations that are used for recommendation but suffer from data sparsity, such as user profiles.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The first step to generating pseudo-tags is to find tracks that are similar to a track {a mathematical formula}T. First, a nearest-neighbour retrieval is made using content-based similarity, where the K most similar tracks to {a mathematical formula}T are retrieved.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Each of these K retrieved tracks will have an associated tag representation, which can then be used to learn pseudo-tags for track {a mathematical formula}T.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A more refined approach is to weight the contribution of each retrieved track's tag vector, based on how similar it is to the query.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This increased number of pseudo-tags over the typical number of tags can provide problems when computing similarity between a pseudo-tag vector and tag vector, and so only the most relevant pseudo-tags should be selected.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Using a leave-n-out strategy on our training set, we evaluate recommendation quality using different numbers of pseudo-tags, and aggregate these results based on how many tags a track has.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Using this method of combining pseudo-tags with tags, we are now able to represent every track by a hybrid vector h. For tracks which are well-tagged, the tag vector will be the main contributor to h, and therefore allow recommendation to be made using the strengths of tag representation.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This evaluation allows us to understand the effects that pseudo-tags have on the system as a whole, and also the effect our Hybrid representation has across varying degrees of tag sparsity.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The solid line shows recommendation quality for our Hybrid method, and the dashed line for tag-based recommendations.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For all numbers of recommendation, the Hybrid approach offers significantly better recommendations than the tag-based method.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For tracks with a small number of tags, the pseudo-tag representation is given a higher weighting in the hybrid representation, and are allowed to control recommendation.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To further examine how this dynamic generation of a hybrid representation affects recommendation, we show the results by the number of tags a query has, in Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">That is, the recommendation quality of a hybrid system must always be greater than the maximum quality of both content and tags, for all given numbers of tags in a representation.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The creators of this dataset provide tag data in two formats: soft annotations which are weighted track-tag pairs, based on how the students voted on tags; and hard-annotations which identify tags as relevant, if a predefined threshold is met.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">With the random method, when K is equal to the size of the training set, precision is reduced to that of the completely random system.</a>
