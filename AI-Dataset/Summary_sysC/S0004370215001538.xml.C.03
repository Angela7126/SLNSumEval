<a href="#0" id="0">While some computational models of intelligence test problems were proposed throughout the second half of the XXth century, in the first years of the XXIst century we have seen an increasing number of computer systems being able to score well on particular intelligence test tasks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a conclusion, these tests and the computer models attempting them show that AI is still lacking general techniques to deal with a variety of problems at the same time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Nonetheless, a renewed attention on these problems and a more careful understanding of what intelligence tests offer for AI may help build new bridges between psychometrics, cognitive science, and AI; and may motivate new kinds of problem repositories.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Nonetheless, there are many other human intelligence tests and cognitive tests that also measure intelligence.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, in the 1990s, cognitive science research recovered this line of research, and cognitive models were proposed to simulate the human cognitive processes that take place when solving inductive inference in intelligence test problems [14].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Extending the parallel from the history of general game playing to computer models solving intelligence tests, the composition of an inventory of problems and the proposal of some criteria to compare the different systems is a crucial step.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We hope that our work can be a starting point towards a more systematic and general treatment of computer models solving intelligence tests and towards the development of (more) general intelligent systems passing arbitrary intelligence tests.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">With regard to the classes of problems and systems considered in our inventory, we will not cover any informal conception about how any of these problems can be solved (e.g., from psychology) if this conception is not accompanied by a computer implementation and the application of the system to a set of intelligence test problems.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In other words, these cognitive approaches are not meant to build systems that are able to perform well (or perfectly) in some tasks (or even in intelligence test problems), but rather that perform in the same way humans do, solving problems that humans usually solve but also failing at problems where humans fail.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We refer to some of these tests as ‘ similar ’ to intelligence test because those tests do not originate from psychometrics but from AI or cognitive science, and have never been used to evaluate humans systematically.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the introduction we mentioned that the main goal of the paper was to understand the meaning, usefulness, and impact of several computer models taking intelligence test problems like those seen in the previous section.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The ‘ years ’ criterion gives us a chronological perspective that can show trends about the interest in computer models solving intelligence test problems.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The first question (Q1) is about the relevance of this area of research: Are computer models solving intelligence tests becoming more wide-spread and more relevant for AI?</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">So, the second question (Q2) is: How challenging are intelligence test problems for AI and what are the challenges?</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In particular, the third question (Q3) is: Are computer models for solving intelligence test problems useful for understanding human cognition?</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In this section we shortly describe all the computer models that have addressed intelligence tests and related tests following a chronological order.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">A crucial difference that makes systems distinctive is not only the kind of problems they solve, but also the great deal of techniques that have been used for solving the same or different intelligence tests.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">First, humans are general-purpose systems and it is not fair to compare them with some systems that are only able to solve one problem — even if the problem comes from an intelligence test.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Second, many of these intelligence test problems have been developed for humans, and hence it can be unfair to evaluate AI systems limitations with anthropocentric measures.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In fact, focussing on the most difficult problems may even make the system more specialised to the intelligence test task at hand.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We see that some intelligence test problems integrate too many processes and may take many others for granted.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">There seems to be broad interest in computer models solving intelligence tests in all three disciplines if we look at the column ‘ intention ’ in Table 4.</a>
