<a href="#1" id="1">The Choquet integral value of alternative {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X is defined as:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}Cv(x) represents the overall utility of alternative x.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, alternative x is as least as good as y whenever {a mathematical formula}Cv(x) ≥ Cv(y).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Definition 5</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The max regret (MR) of alternative {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X is defined as:{a mathematical formula} The max regret of x is the worst-case loss when recommending x instead of one of the adversary's choices (i.e.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">any element of {a mathematical formula}arg ⁡ minx ∈ X ⁡ MR(x,X, Θ P)).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Recommending such an alternative allows one to guarantee that the worst-case loss is minimized.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Constant utility profiles of type {a mathematical formula} Λ =( Λ , … , Λ ) ∈ [0,1]n.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Case{a mathematical formula}A ∈ Aand{a mathematical formula}B ∉ A: in that case, we have {a mathematical formula}A ∈ {B ′ ∈ A:B ′ ⊂ B}.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Case {a mathematical formula}A ∉ A and {a mathematical formula}B ∉ A: Since {a mathematical formula}A ⊂ B, we have {a mathematical formula}lA ≤ lB by hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Moreover, we necessarily have {a mathematical formula}{A ′ ∈ A:A ′ ⊂ A} ⊂ {B ′ ∈ A:B ′ ⊂ B}.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, using Equation (10), we have:{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Since sets belonging to {a mathematical formula}A(x,y) are the only ones that appear in the objective function of PL1, then by applying Proposition 1 to set {a mathematical formula}A=A(x,y), we know that {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) can be solved by considering only monotonicity constraints involving variables {a mathematical formula}vA, {a mathematical formula}A ∈ A(x,y).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Therefore, we can compute {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) by solving the following simpler linear program:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">{a mathematical formula}V={X(i),i ∈ N} ∪ {Y(i),i ∈ N} is composed of all sets {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N associated to decision variables {a mathematical formula}vA in LP3.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In the previous subsections, we have shown that, assuming that preference statements are of types {a mathematical formula}(1A0, Λ ) or {a mathematical formula}( Λ ,1A0), we are able to efficiently compute minimax regret values.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We introduce now a query generation strategy determining the most informative query involving a binary alternative and a constant profile.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Our query generation strategy uses the WmMR criterion presented in Definition 7.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Since at each iteration step the DM is asked to compare a binary alternative 1A0 to a constant profile {a mathematical formula} Λ =( Λ , … , Λ ), an optimal query for this criterion is defined by a pair {a mathematical formula}(A ⊆ N, Λ ∈ [lA,uA]) that reduces the minimax regret in the worst-case as much as possible.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">More precisely, to find such a pair, for all sets {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, we have to determine the following value:{a mathematical formula} and then, we arbitrary select a set {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ in {a mathematical formula}arg ⁡ minA ⊆ N ⁡ WmMR((A, Λ A), Θ P); thus, the pair {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Λ A ⁎ ) defines an optimal query for the WmMR criterion.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Given a set {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, determining {a mathematical formula} Λ A amounts to minimizing over {a mathematical formula} Λ ∈ [lA,uA] the maximum between:</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The first numerical tests aim to evaluate the efficiency of the incremental elicitation procedure presented in Section 3.4 in terms of number of queries needed to make a decision.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Recall that each generated query involves two fictitious alternatives carefully chosen: one binary alternative of type {a mathematical formula}1A0, {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, and one constant utility profile of type {a mathematical formula} Λ =( Λ , … , Λ ), {a mathematical formula} Λ ∈ [lA,uA].</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Hence, as a baseline for comparison, we consider the query generation strategy that consists in choosing, at each iteration step of the elicitation procedure, both set {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N and {a mathematical formula} Λ ∈ [lA,uA] at random.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">As in the choice problem, we reason with a partially specified capacity used in the Choquet integral.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">In this framework, an alternative x is necessarily at least as good as an alternative y when {a mathematical formula}Cv(x) ≥ Cv(y) for all admissible capacities {a mathematical formula}v ∈ Θ P, that is when {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P)<0.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">In order to save queries, we might assume that x is preferred to y when {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) ≤ Δ where {a mathematical formula} Δ ≥ 0 is a (small) tolerance threshold.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">We will first generate preference queries and use minimax regret computations to determine a top alternative with a max regret lower than threshold Δ .</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Then, this alternative is deleted and the selection process is iterated on the remaining set of alternatives with the same tolerance threshold.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">The selected alternative in this second stage will be the second best alternative in the ranking and so forth (see Algorithm 2).</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Proof</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Let {a mathematical formula}P ′ be the set of preference statements collected until the insertion of x in the ranking.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Since y is ranked below x, we know that {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P ′ ) ≤ Δ .</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}P ′ ⊆ P, then we have {a mathematical formula} Θ P ′ ⊇ Θ P and (refer to Equation (2)) therefore {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) ≤ PMR(x,y, Θ P ′ ) ≤ Δ .</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Definition 8</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">The max regret (MR) of {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X with respect to category {a mathematical formula}K ℓ is:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">We now define the notion of minimax regret and the MR-optimal category associated to an alternative {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X:</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Definition 9</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">The minimax regret (mMR) of {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X is:{a mathematical formula} The decision rule is that of assigning x to the category that minimizes {a mathematical formula}MR(x,K ℓ , Θ P); this category is called the MR-optimal category of x.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">The mMR represents the maximal utility gap between {a mathematical formula}f Θ (x) and the interval defining the mMR-optimal category.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">Definition 11</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">The worst-case maximum minimax regret (WMmMR) of q is:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Pq denotes the set of all possible answers to query q.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Proof</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">For any solution {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X:{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">In Section 4.1, we introduced the notion of maximum minimax regret for sorting problems, that represents an overall aggregate score to assess the quality of an assignment.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">According to Proposition 9 (see Section 4.2), in order to compute the maximum minimax regret MmMR, one needs to compute {a mathematical formula}fx ⊤ and {a mathematical formula}fx ⊥ for each alternative {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">The optimization of {a mathematical formula}fx ⊤ for Choquet integrals can be performed by solving the following linear program:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Similarly, the optimization of {a mathematical formula}fx ⊥ for Choquet integrals can performed by solving linear program LP4 where the objective function has to be minimized.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">Note that Equations (27), (28), (29) ensure that v is a normalized capacity and Equations (30), (31) ensure that v is compatible with {a mathematical formula}P. We remark that the number of variables and constraints in LP4 are exponential in the number of criteria, due to the monotonicity constraints.</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">Nevertheless, we can again obtain a more compact formulation by considering preference queries involving binary alternatives of type {a mathematical formula}1A0, with {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, and constant utility profiles of type {a mathematical formula} Λ =( Λ , … , Λ ).</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">{a mathematical formula}v ˆ A=vA ⁎ for all {a mathematical formula}A ∈ A(x,y) such that {a mathematical formula} Ω A<0.</a>
