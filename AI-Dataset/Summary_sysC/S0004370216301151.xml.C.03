<a href="#0" id="0">Our model has a teacher and a learner who interact in a sequence of shared situations by producing utterances intended to denote a unique object in each situation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then, the learner and the teacher try to produce an utterance that refers to one of the objects in the situation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The teacher can either produce a correction of the learner's utterance or produce a random denoting utterance for the given situation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We assume that both the teacher and learner can determine whether a meaning is denoting in a situation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The target language is the set containing every utterance such that there exists some situation in which the teacher could produce that utterance.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The goal of the learner is to learn a grammar for the language that will enable it to produce all and only the denoting utterances for any given situation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Initially the teacher and learner know all of the predicates P that will occur in situations, and are able to determine whether a given meaning is denoting in a given situation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If the teacher produces utterances using the meaning transducer {a mathematical formula}M1, after the learner receives a number of situation/utterance pairs, we expect that the word cuadrado will approximately imply the predicate symbol sq1 and will not approximately imply any other predicate symbol, thus giving part of the meaning of the word cuadrado.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given a situation and an utterance by the teacher, the learner uses the transitively reduced implication graph {a mathematical formula}Hr in an attempt to determine the meaning of the teacher's utterance as follows.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In particular, the learner computes a variable-normalized representative of every meaning that is both supported by the situation and is such that its sequence of predicate symbols is in S – these become the learner's guess of the possible meanings of the teacher's utterance in the given situation.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This is the only possible meaning that the learner guesses for this utterance because there is no supported meaning with the predicate sequence {a mathematical formula}(gr1,re1), and no other inequivalent supported meaning with the predicate sequence {a mathematical formula}(sq1,re1).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To facilitate the “ aging out ” of incorrect general forms that are acquired early in the learner's experience, the learner records the interaction number of the most recent teacher utterance with a unique possible meaning that matched the general form.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In attempting to produce an utterance appropriate to the current situation, the learner finds all the meanings generated by its general forms using predicates from the current situation, and tests each meaning to see if it is denoting in the current situation, producing a set of possible denoting meanings for this situation.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To produce one utterance for the current situation, the learner selects one of the possible denoting utterances with a probability proportional to the square of the interaction number stored with the general form used to produce the corresponding meaning.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">If the learner produces an utterance, the teacher analyzes it and then chooses its own utterance for the situation.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">If the learner produced no utterance or an uncorrectable one, or if the teacher did not choose to correct the learner's utterance, then the teacher's utterance is chosen uniformly at random from the denoting utterances for the situation.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For example, the teacher translates the incorrect learner utterance el elipse pequeno into the predicate sequence {a mathematical formula}(el1,sm1) despite the errors of agreement in the utterance.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">A possible correction is chosen by the teacher by considering the set of denoting utterances whose meanings have the same sequence of predicates and choosing one such utterance using a measure of similarity to the learner's utterance.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">If so, the teacher classifies the learner's utterance as having an error in meaning and chooses as the possible correction a denoting utterance whose predicate sequence is judged “ most similar ” to the predicate sequence for the learner's utterance.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">For example, if the learner's utterance is el pequeno and the predicate sequence {a mathematical formula}(el1,sm1) corresponds to a denoting utterance for the situation, the teacher may choose la elipse pequena as the possible correction.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The level of performance of a learner attempting to learn a given language L is measured using two quantities: the correctness and completeness of the learner's utterances in a given situation.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The correctness of the learner in the given situation is the sum of the probabilities of the learner's utterances that are in the correct denoting set.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The completeness of the learner in the given situation is the fraction of the correct denoting utterances that appear in the set of learner utterances.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">In our first set of trials, we set a target level of performance of {a mathematical formula}p=0.99 and the learner and teacher engage in a sequence of interactions until the learner first reaches this level of performance.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The learner may also classify a teacher utterance as a correction when it is not intended as a correction.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">This means that the teacher offers a correction to the learner every time it classifies the learner's utterance as an error in form or an error in meaning.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The interaction cycle is as follows: the learner produces an utterance (token), then the teacher produces an utterance (token), and the learner uses the teacher's utterance (token) as a model for correct utterances (tokens) of that kind in the future.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Here is the first interaction in which the learner perceives a correction by the teacher, because the meaning intended by the learner and the learner's understanding of the teacher's utterance are the same, but the actual utterances are different (the learner's utterance has an incorrect choice for the article for the word triangle).</a>
