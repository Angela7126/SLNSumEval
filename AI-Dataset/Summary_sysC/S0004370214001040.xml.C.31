<a href="#1" id="1">(See Hansson [6].)</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An operation ∘ on a belief set K is a relational descriptor revision if and only if there is a set {a mathematical formula}X of belief sets with {a mathematical formula}K ∈ X (its outcome set),{sup:2} and a relation ≦ on {a mathematical formula}X, such that (i) {a mathematical formula}K ≦ X for all {a mathematical formula}X ∈ X, and (ii) for all descriptors Ψ : {a mathematical formula}K ∘ Ψ is the unique ≦ -minimal element of {a mathematical formula}X that satisfies Ψ , unless Ψ is unsatisfiable within {a mathematical formula}X, in which case {a mathematical formula}K ∘ Ψ =K.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Counter-dominance: If {a mathematical formula} Ψ ⊩ Ξ then {a mathematical formula} Ξ ⪰ Ψ</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">is the relation ⪰ on descriptors such that {a mathematical formula} Ξ ⪰ Ψ if and only if either (i) there is some X with {a mathematical formula}X ⊩ Ξ such that {a mathematical formula}X ≦ Y for all Y with {a mathematical formula}Y ⊩ Ψ , or (ii) Ψ is not satisfiable within the domain of ≦ .</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">(1) Let ∘ be a descriptor revision on the belief set K and ⁎ its derived semirevision operator.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It does not hold in general that ∘ is derivable from ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">(2) Let ≦ be a total belief set ordering and{a mathematical formula} ≦ ⋆ its additive restriction.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It does not hold in general that ≦ is derivable from{a mathematical formula} ≦ ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">(3) Let ⪰ be a proximity relation and{a mathematical formula} ⪰ ⋆ the believability relation that is based on it.</a>
