<a href="#0" id="0">A set of Φ -types {a mathematical formula} Τ 1, … , Τ m is called a type-certificate for Φ if it satisfies the following existential conditions:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">for each variable r in Φ , there is k ({a mathematical formula}1 ≤ k ≤ m) for which {a mathematical formula}r ∘ ∈ Τ k;</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The Jordan curve theorem states that, for any Jordan curve Γ in {a mathematical formula}S2, its complement {a mathematical formula}S2 ∖ Γ has exactly two components.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This theorem has a converse: if X is a closed set such that {a mathematical formula}S2 ∖ X has two components, with each {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X accessible from both of them, then X is (the locus of) a Jordan curve (see, e.g., [28]).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The Schönflies theorem states that, if {a mathematical formula} Γ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Γ 2 are Jordan curves in {a mathematical formula}S2 and f is a homeomorphism from (the locus of) {a mathematical formula} Γ 1 onto (the locus of) {a mathematical formula} Γ 2, then f can be extended to a homeomorphism from {a mathematical formula}S2 onto itself.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A design is a pair {a mathematical formula}D=(G,S), where {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) is a graph and S a set of 2-element subsets of E. If {a mathematical formula}D=(G,S) is a design, a drawing of D (in either {a mathematical formula}R2 or {a mathematical formula}S2) is a realization f of {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) with the additional property that, for all distinct {a mathematical formula}e,e ′ ∈ E, {a mathematical formula}f(e) and {a mathematical formula}f(e ′ ) have an internal point in common if and only if {a mathematical formula}(e,e ′ ) ∈ S.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula} Α 1, … , Α n be Jordan arcs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Form the graph {a mathematical formula}(V,E) where {a mathematical formula}V={ Α 1, … , Α n} and {a mathematical formula}( Α i, Α j) ∈ E just in case {a mathematical formula}i ≠ j and {a mathematical formula} Α i and {a mathematical formula} Α j have at least one point in common.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Any graph G isomorphic to such a {a mathematical formula}(V,E) is called a string graph, and the sequence of Jordan arcs {a mathematical formula} Α 1, … , Α n is called a string representation of G. By the string graph problem, we understand the following:{a mathematical formula} Kratochvíl obtained the following lower bound:</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then we cylindrify this assignment in {a mathematical formula}R3 and use the third dimension to make the regions in {a mathematical formula}p¯ interior-connected (in the same way as in [20]) while keeping the regions in {a mathematical formula}q¯ disconnected.The implication {a mathematical formula}(c) ⇒ (b) is trivial.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The matching upper bound follows from a polynomial model property of the kind established by Lemma 19: if Φ is satisfied by {a mathematical formula}a then we can fix at most {a mathematical formula}3| Φ | points of a point-certificate for Φ under {a mathematical formula}a and, by Lemma 19, find a tuple of at most {a mathematical formula}3| Φ |×2| Φ | Φ -characters that induce a satisfying assignment for Φ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We now proceed to show that (r) becomes false if ‘ component ’ is replaced by ‘ i-component ’ : {a mathematical formula}RCC8c-constraint networks can in general force satisfying tuples to have exponentially many i-components (Theorem 30, Theorem 31).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">And indeed, a simple modification of the argument of Theorem 30 shows that there exists a sequence {a mathematical formula}{ Φ n}n ≥ 1 of {a mathematical formula}RCC8c ∘ -networks, satisfiable over {a mathematical formula}RCP+(R2), such that {a mathematical formula}| Φ n| is {a mathematical formula}O(n), but every satisfying assignment involves a drawing with {a mathematical formula}2 Ω (n) arc-crossings.</a>
