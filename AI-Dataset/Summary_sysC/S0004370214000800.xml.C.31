<a href="#0" id="0">The key problem is how to effectively tune the weights.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is obvious that at the first period, source classifier is constantly zero function, so the source function is weighted with 0; while target function is weighted with 1 throughout it.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To dynamically adjust the weights for the remaining steps, we use the following performance-driven exponential weighted updating scheme: when {a mathematical formula}mod(t,Pi) ≠ 0{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}st(u)=exp ⁡ { − Η ℓ ⁎ ( Π (u ⊤ xt), Π (yt))}, {a mathematical formula} ∀ u ∈ Rm and {a mathematical formula} ℓ ⁎ (z,y)=(z − y)2 in our approach.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, Algorithm 4 summarizes the proposed Concept Drift Online Learning (CDOL) algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">2 evaluates the online prediction performance of the compared algorithms with varied C values across all the homogeneous learning tasks.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Several observations can be drawn from the results.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First of all, it is clear that the proposed two online transfer learning algorithms are significantly more effective than the other algorithms for most cases.</a>
