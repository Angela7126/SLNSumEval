<a href="#0" id="0">an iteration period Λ and a feasible assignment of {a mathematical formula}start(i,0){a mathematical formula} ∀ i ∈ V such that all dependencies are consistent, no resource capacity is exceeded and the iteration period Λ is minimized.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The output of the solution approach is the schedule (or block) identified by the black arrows, which is then repeated every iteration period {a mathematical formula} Λ =27.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, the relation:{a mathematical formula} is rewritten as:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} performing the usual eliminations we have the following inequality that no longer depends on Ω :{a mathematical formula} This is a very important result and it is equivalent to say that in a periodic schedule, if the (modular) precedence constraints are satisfied for iteration 0, then they are satisfied for every other iteration.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to model a temporal dependency {a mathematical formula} 〈 i,j, Θ (i,j), Δ (i,j) 〉 we have implemented a modular precedence constraint (ModPC), with the following signature:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}ei,sj, Η i, Β j, Λ are the variables representing the end time of activity i, the start time of activity j, their respective iteration numbers and the period.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We recall that the Modular Precedence Constraint (ModPC) constraint has the following signature:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}ei,sj, Η i, Β j, Λ are variables representing respectively the end time of activity i, the start time of activity j, their respective iteration numbers and the modulus, and {a mathematical formula} Θ (i,j), {a mathematical formula} Δ (i,j) are constant values representing the minimum time lag and the iteration distance associated to the arc.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The filtering rules for the iteration variables, which updates the bounds of the {a mathematical formula} Η i and {a mathematical formula} Β j variables so that a proper distance (in terms of number of iterations) exists between activity i and j.</a>
