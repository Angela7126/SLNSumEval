<a href="#0" id="0">The first important observation here is that, by Lemma 10, the representation {a mathematical formula} Ξ ([ ↕ ] Ψ ) is unique.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The second important observation is that (assuming that it is defined) each {a mathematical formula} Φ n+1 is a consistent theory, since they are of the form {a mathematical formula} Φ n+ Ψ with {a mathematical formula}¬ Ψ ∉ Φ n.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">So if {a mathematical formula}¬ Ξ ([ ↕ ] Ψ ) ∈ Φ n then there must be some {a mathematical formula} Ξ ([U] Ψ ) ∉ Φ n, as otherwise closure under (R4) would imply that {a mathematical formula} Ξ ([ ↕ ] Ψ ) ∈ Φ n.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If {a mathematical formula} Ξ ([U] Ψ ) ∉ Φ n then also {a mathematical formula}¬¬ Ξ ([U] Ψ ) ∉ Φ n.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The lowest numbered formula with this property is {a mathematical formula} Φ j.Now let {a mathematical formula} Ψ = ⋃ n=0 ∞ Φ n.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Firstly, suppose that {a mathematical formula}[U][ ↕ ] Ψ ∈ Φ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Observe that {a mathematical formula}[U]([ ↕ ] Ψ → [U0] Ψ ) ∈ Φ and {a mathematical formula}[U]([ ↕ ] Ψ → [U0] Ψ ) → ([U][ ↕ ] Ψ → [U][U0] Ψ ) for every {a mathematical formula}U0 ∈ LAUL, since both formulas are derivable in {a mathematical formula}LAAUL.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Furthermore, Φ is closed under (R1), so {a mathematical formula}[U][U0] Ψ ∈ Φ .The update {a mathematical formula}U0, being an element of {a mathematical formula}LAUL, does not contain any {a mathematical formula}[ ↕ ] operators.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As such, the {a mathematical formula}[ ↕ ]-depth of {a mathematical formula}[U][U0] Ψ is strictly lower than that of {a mathematical formula}[U][ ↕ ] Ψ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We therefore have {a mathematical formula}[U][U0] Ψ <ds[U][ ↕ ] Ψ , so by the induction hypothesis our assumption that {a mathematical formula}[U][U0] Ψ ∈ Φ yields the conclusion that {a mathematical formula}Mc, Φ ⊨ [U][U0] Ψ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">By the semantics of AAUL, the latter is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}Mc ⁎ U, Φ ⊨ [U0] Ψ .</a>
