<a href="#0" id="0">We will now characterise the probability that the solution of a sampled SCSPs {a mathematical formula}P ˆ N over N scenarios, which may be computed by using any of the existing approaches discussed in [3], [4], is a solution to the original single-stage SCSP {a mathematical formula}P.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These results are also applicable to multi-stage problems, provided that a rolling horizon approach is adopted and that the aim is to characterise the probability that stage one decisions of a sampled SCSPs {a mathematical formula}P ˆ N over N scenarios are consistent with respect to the original SCSP {a mathematical formula}P.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In Section 8.4 we will generate approximate ({a mathematical formula} Α , Θ )-solution sets using Definition 7 for the first two problems and show numerically that, with probability greater than or equal to Α , the approach we discussed generates solution sets that satisfy chance constraints in the model with a margin of error Θ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The number of Monte Carlo runs was set to guarantee a margin of error of {a mathematical formula} Θ /10 with a confidence level of 0.9, in such a way as to ensure an approximation error negligible with respect to the chosen Θ . SSLSP instances can be solved to optimality by using a deterministic equivalent mixed integer linear programming model [30].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In our analysis, we can therefore compare results obtained with our approach against the true optimal solutions.</a>
