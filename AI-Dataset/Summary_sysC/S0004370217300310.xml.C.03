<a href="#0" id="0">Yet over the years the fields of AI and Robotics drifted apart.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This special issue brings together the state of the art and practice of the emergent field of integrated AI and Robotics, and highlights the key areas along which this current evolution of machine intelligence is heading.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Third, having gone through an ‘ AI Winter ’ , researchers have not only become more adept at divining what techniques and representations are likely to be promising, they have also made substantial inroads into the science of both AI and Robotics — contributions to this special issue clearly showcase this.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This special issue on “ AI and Robotics ” provides one such venue, presenting a carefully selected set of successful integration efforts.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is our hope that it will constitute an important stepping stone in building a community of AI and Robotics researchers working across their traditional boundaries towards an ultimately shared scientific goal, thus setting the stage for a new science of integrated AI and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">An early use of AI was in automatic problem solving.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The vision of automated problem solving in the physical world was first realized in concrete form in the Shakey project, arguably the first robot that used AI methods [25].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It was in this context that a range of activities were pushed towards reuniting AI and Robotics at the end of the 90's, bringing physical embodiments and reasoning together.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This has since been sustained by events at major AI conferences with an outreach to the robotics field, and vice versa, like robotic competitions and tracks at IJCAI, AAAI and ICAPS, and special sessions on cognitive abilities at ICRA and IROS.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Since AI and Robotics have been disjoint for so long, and since they developed within different academic compartments, integrating results from these fields is especially challenging.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">One would expect that this research line leverages the rich AI tradition in knowledge representation and ontologies.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Most AI techniques address a single cognitive ability and rely on a single type of knowledge.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The applicability of a given AI technique, designed to provide a certain cognitive ability, to robotics may depend on its ability to address one or more of the above challenges.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Each cell at the intersection of a cognitive ability and a robotic challenge can host a family of open research questions: how to extend the existing AI techniques that implement that ability, so that they can cope with that challenge.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">1 gives structure to the research landscape in the field of integrated AI and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This Special Issue is based on an open call to both the AI and Robotics communities.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">{sup:6} The 18 contributions to this special issue illustrate how AI methods and techniques addressing a given cognitive ability can be extended to address some of our four robotic challenges.</a>
