<a href="#0" id="0">In [10] the postulates (that we recalled in Subsection 2.2) proposed in [6] for shielded contractions on belief sets were adapted to the belief bases context: Relative success:{a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α =A or {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ Cn(A ∼ Α ).Persistence:If {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β , then {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α ⊢ Β .Success propagation:If {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊢ Β and {a mathematical formula} ⊢ Β → Α , then {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α ⊢ Α .Conjunctive constancy:If {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α =A ∼ Β =A, then {a mathematical formula}A ∼ ( Α ∧ Β )=A.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then ∼ is the shielded base contraction induced by ÷ and R if and only if:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We note that if ∼ is a shielded contraction induced by a contraction operator and the set {a mathematical formula}R=L\Cn( ∅ ), then ∼ is a (standard) contraction operator that satisfies failure.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If ∼ is the shielded contraction induced by ÷ and R, it holds that:{a mathematical formula} This contradicts one of the main goals underlying the concept of “ irretractability ” : irretractable sentences should be kept (more precisely, should be implied) after performing the related shielded contraction (by any sentence).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We note that, if {a mathematical formula}R ≠ L satisfies non-retractability propagation, then it is not logically closed i.e., the fact that {a mathematical formula}R ⊢ Α does not imply that {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let A be a belief base, ∼ be an operator on A,{a mathematical formula}R={ Α :A ∼ Α ⊬ Α }and ÷ be the operator defined (for all Α ) by the following condition:{a mathematical formula}where − is an operator on A that satisfies success, inclusion, uniformity and relevance.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In Definition 3.1 we have introduced, from a constructive perspective, the concept of shielded base contraction induced by a contraction operator ÷ and a set of retractable sentences R. At this point we notice that if, alternatively, we wished to define shielded base contractions in terms of postulates then, having in mind (i) the definition for contraction recalled in Definition 2.5, and (ii) the postulates for shielded contraction presented in Subsections 2.3 and 2.4, the most natural proposal would be to define a shielded base contraction as an operator that satisfies the postulates of relative success and inclusion.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">an operator ÷ that satisfies success and inclusion) and a set of retractable sentences {a mathematical formula}R ⊆ L (which is not required to satisfy any properties at all) does not satisfy the postulate of relative success.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A shielded base contraction ∼ on a belief base A induced by a contraction ÷ and a set {a mathematical formula}R ⊆ L is a basic shielded contraction if and only if ÷ satisfies failure or R satisfies non-retractability of tautology.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let A be a belief base, {a mathematical formula}R ⊆ L and ∼ be a shielded base contraction induced by a contraction operator ÷ and R. We intend to prove that R satisfies non-retractability preservation if and only if R satisfies non-retractability upper bounding, and ÷ and R satisfy condition (R - ÷).Assume first that R satisfies non-retractability preservation.Condition(R - ÷): Assume that {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ R and {a mathematical formula} Β ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Hence {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ R if and only if {a mathematical formula} Β ∈ R.Retractability of logical equivalents: Follows by Observation 3.4 since, as shown above, R satisfies uniform retractability.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Hence, by definition of R, {a mathematical formula} Β ∉ R.Retractability of logical equivalents: Follows trivially by Observation 3.4, since, as shown above, R satisfies non-retractability propagation.Assume that ∼ satisfies inclusion and persistence.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Then {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ R.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence {a mathematical formula}A÷ Α =A − Α .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since, according to Observation 2.6, − satisfies failure, it follows that {a mathematical formula}A÷ Α =A.Assume that ∼ satisfies relative closure.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Assume that it holds for all subsets {a mathematical formula}A ′ of A that {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊢ Α if and only if {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊢ Β .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">By ∼ uniformity it follows that {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α =A ∼ Β .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Consider the case that {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Hence {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Α ⊬ Α .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Thus {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊬ Α .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">By ∼ inclusion{a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊆ A.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Therefore, by hypothesis, {a mathematical formula}A ∼ Β ⊬ Β .</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Hence, {a mathematical formula} Β ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Thus {a mathematical formula}A÷ Α =A÷ Β .</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Consider now that {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ R.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Hence {a mathematical formula} Β ∉ R.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Hence {a mathematical formula}A÷ Α =A − Α and {a mathematical formula}A÷ Β =A − Β , from which it follows, by − uniformity, that {a mathematical formula}A÷ Α =A÷ Β .Assume that ∼ satisfies relevance.</a>
