<a href="#0" id="0">The first problem can be resolved using taxonomy-based methods, which use a taxonomy of items and measure the similarity of users based on the users ʼ ratings of items and the classes that include them.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, the previous method based on a single taxonomy could not resolve the problem of the sparsity of items and that of SAs simultaneously, while still maintaining the semantic relationships expressed by the linked information of a tag assigned to an item by a user.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, this means that we cannot analyze the semantic relationships expressed by the linked information of the tag “ thrilling, ” which is an SA in SC {a mathematical formula}sc1 and was assigned by user u to the item “ Talk to Her ” in the item class “ romance. ” Moreover, no solutions allow multiple taxonomies to be handled when analyzing the semantic relationships expressed by the linked information of a tag assigned by a user to an item.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Using a taxonomy of items, these methods measure the similarity of users based on class information.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By focusing on improving the accuracy, the taxonomy-based method can increase the diversity of recommendation list entries, or present the active user with the semantic relationships between predicted items and the previous interests of the user by referring to the taxonomy.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the present study, we also assume that it is important to present the semantic relationships between user interests and recommendation results, particularly when recommending items based on the SAs given by users, which is often difficult for users to understand.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We confirmed the effectiveness of linking separate taxonomies of SAs and items by comparing the results obtained using linked taxonomies with those using a previous method [7] with a single taxonomy that merged subjective and item taxonomies in a naive manner.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The approach described above measures the similarity of users based on linked taxonomies rather than a single taxonomy of items, which is the case in previous taxonomy-based method [7], [24].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">When linking a taxonomy of SAs to a taxonomy of items, it is important to determine the SAs that are useful for measuring the similarity of users to improve recommendations.</a>
