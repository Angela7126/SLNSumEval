<a href="#0" id="0">The proof is based on a reduction from the set-packing decision problem — where we are given a constant q and a family of sets {a mathematical formula}S and we need to determine whether a set of q mutually-disjoint sets exists — to the following decision problem: given a characteristic function with which every coalition in {a mathematical formula}S has a value of 1, and every coalition outside of {a mathematical formula}S has a value of 0, determine whether a coalition structure exists whose value is at least q.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By computing {a mathematical formula}UB ⁎ , we can establish a bound on the quality of the best coalition structure found at any point in time, denoted by {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ ⁎ ; this bound is {a mathematical formula} Β =UB ⁎ /V(CS ⁎ ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">[56] studied the coalition structure generation problem given a restricted class of basic MC-nets, where {a mathematical formula}Pr ≠ ∅ and {a mathematical formula} Θ r>0 for every r.{sup:18} In particular, they define a set of rules {a mathematical formula}R ′ ⊆ R to be feasible if all the rules in {a mathematical formula}R ′ are applicable at the same time to some coalition structure.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In other words, {a mathematical formula}R ′ is feasible if there exists a coalition structure CS such that every rule {a mathematical formula}r ∈ R ′ is applicable to some {a mathematical formula}C ∈ CS.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The problem of finding an optimal coalition structure is then equivalent to the problem of finding a feasible set of rules {a mathematical formula}R ′ such that {a mathematical formula} ∑ r ∈ R ′ Θ r is maximized.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Formally, a CCF game is a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 A, Π ¨A,v 〉 where A is the set of agents, {a mathematical formula} Π ¨A is the set of coalition structures that are feasible (i.e., allowed to form), and v is the characteristic function that assigns a real value to every coalition that appears in some feasible coalition structure.</a>
