<a href="#0" id="0">One important case where the bidders are not acting strategically is when they are not aware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information (in which case {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Otherwise, if {a mathematical formula}Rauc ≠ ∅ , the auctioneer may deviate to not purchasing the information (thus necessarily using {a mathematical formula}Rauc ′ = ∅ ) or using {a mathematical formula}Rauc ′ ≠ Rauc such that {a mathematical formula}Rauc ′ ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A solution {a mathematical formula}(R ⁎ ,R ⁎ ) that yields the auctioneer an expected benefit greater than or equal to the expected benefit if switching to any other strategy {a mathematical formula}Rauc is necessarily an equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However if deviating to {a mathematical formula}Rauc= ∅ is beneficial then the marginal benefit from purchasing the information compared to when not purchasing the information, given that the bidders bid according to {a mathematical formula}xmin=argminx{uauc(X=x)} whenever no value is disclosed, is lesser than the cost C of purchasing the information.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The auctioneer's expected benefit table for the different strategy combinations for the case {a mathematical formula}C=0 is given in Table 2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When {a mathematical formula}C=1.15, these solutions are still stable, however the solution {a mathematical formula}( ∅ , ∅ ) also becomes stable, and since the latter offers a greater expected benefit to the auctioneer it becomes the equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It is possible that for some {a mathematical formula}C<C ⁎ the solution {a mathematical formula}( ∅ , ∅ ) is stable and in such case, according to Theorem 2, it offers an expected benefit to the auctioneer greater than ({a mathematical formula}S[1],S[1]) for that cost.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The analysis of the case where bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information is an instance of the case where the auctioneer needs to calculate her expected-benefit-maximizing strategy given the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, as given in Section 3.2, for {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The stability of the solution according to which the auctioneer does not purchase the information in the model with aware bidders is achieved only when {a mathematical formula}u( ∅ , ∅ ) is greater than or equal to any other element in the first column of the solution space matrix (see Table 1).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore the expected benefit of the auctioneer in equilibrium when the set R is used is given by {a mathematical formula}U(R,R)= ∑ x ∈ RPr(X=x) ⋅ Vt(x)+B(t, ∅ ) ⋅ ∑ x ∉ RPr(X=x) − C.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The proof is based on Lemma 1: For {a mathematical formula}C=0 all potential equilibrium solutions yield the same expected benefit to the auctioneer as {a mathematical formula}R= ∅ and less for any {a mathematical formula}C>0.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The mixed stable solution in this case is {a mathematical formula}Rauc=Rbidder=(0.86,0,1) and its expected benefit for the auctioneer is 6.5 (i.e., dominated by the pure stable solution).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Overall, we observe that the increase in the number of bidders results in an increase in the auctioneer's expected benefit and a decrease in the bidders' expected benefit (for any number of agents {a mathematical formula}n1>n2 and cost C for which the same decision of whether or not to purchase the information is made).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Nevertheless, since the cost at which the transition between purchasing the information to not purchasing it also increases as n increases, it is possible that for some costs, with {a mathematical formula}n1 bidders the information is not purchased in equilibrium and with {a mathematical formula}n2>n1 the information is purchased in equilibrium, yielding to the auctioneer an expected benefit lower than the one obtained for {a mathematical formula}n1.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In this case the expected benefit of the auctioneer with 5 bidders is greater than her expected benefit with {a mathematical formula}n=6.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This is because with {a mathematical formula}N ′ the expected benefit is greater than with some greater N values, as it is better to have {a mathematical formula}N ′ bidders and not purchase the information, than to have more than {a mathematical formula}N ′ bidders however purchase the information.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">However, starting from {a mathematical formula}N ″ for which the equilibrium is to purchase the information, the auctioneer is better off with having {a mathematical formula}N ″ − 1 bidders as the expected benefit with this number of bidders (and not purchasing the information) is greater than with more bidders (however having to purchase the information).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">5, if the cost of purchasing the information is {a mathematical formula}C<6 then the auctioneer's expected benefit is greater than the one resulting from not having the option to purchase the information in the first place.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">5, for {a mathematical formula}N=6 the auctioneer's expected benefit is greater when the cost of purchasing the information is 40 compared to when {a mathematical formula}C=10).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">When the bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's access to the information, the auctioneer purchases the information (if {a mathematical formula}C ≤ 13.3), disclosing the common value only if it is {a mathematical formula}x1 or {a mathematical formula}x2.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Here, for any cost {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ C ≤ 4.05 the equilibrium in the bidders' awareness case is {a mathematical formula}({x1,x2,x3},{x1,x2,x3}) and its expected benefit to the auctioneer is greater than in the case where bidders are unaware of the option of purchasing the information.</a>
