<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we develop a method for modelling the inherent visual data concept structures based on a novel Hierarchical-Multi-Label Random Forest model capable of correlating structured visual and tag information so as to more accurately interpret the visual semantics, e.g.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Intrinsic hierarchical tag structures are not considered in model design; (2) Tag statistical correlations and the interactions between visual and tag data are not fully exploited, partly due to model complexity and design limitation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our model goes beyond the classification forest in the following aspects: (1) Employing tags to constrain tree structure learning, rather than learning a generalised prediction function as [49], [45]; (2) Introducing a new objective function allowing acceptance of multi-tags, exploitation of abstract-to-specific tag hierarchy and accommodation of multiple tag correlations simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These structural relationships among data samples imply their underlying data group/cluster relations (obtained using a standard graph based clustering algorithm on the similarity graph estimated by our HML-RF model), as well as the specific tag concept structures of individual samples (predicted using the discovered semantic neighbourhoods encoded in the tree structures of HML-RF).</a>
