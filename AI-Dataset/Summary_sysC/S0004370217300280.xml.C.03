<a href="#0" id="0">Syntactically, a causal action theory is a pair {a mathematical formula}(S,D), where S is a set of static causal rules, and D is a set of dynamic causal rules.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Both static and dynamic causal rules are pairs of the form {a mathematical formula}(l,G), where l is a fluent literal, and G a set of fluent literals.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">No ramification when static causal rules do not interact with dynamic causal rulesLet{a mathematical formula}T=(S,D)be a causal action theory.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a causal action theory {a mathematical formula}T=(S,D), its dependency graph is the directed graph such that</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Premises of static causal rules can be combinedLet{a mathematical formula}T=(S,D)be a causal action theory.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our causal action theories can be mapped to theories in action languages {a mathematical formula}B, {a mathematical formula}C, and others in a straightforward way.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For instance, consider the causal action theory {a mathematical formula}T=({(f2,f1),(f1,f2)}, ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If {a mathematical formula}s= ∅ , and {a mathematical formula}s ′ ={f1,f2}, then both s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ satisfies all static causal rules, and according to {a mathematical formula}C semantics, {a mathematical formula}s ′ is a possible new state after the action A occurs in state s.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Notice that a mapping Ξ from causal action theories to logic programs yields a semantic function Δ under (1) and (2): {a mathematical formula}(s,s ′ ) ∈ Δ (T) iff there is an answer set A of {a mathematical formula} Ξ (T) such that (1) and (2) hold.</a>
