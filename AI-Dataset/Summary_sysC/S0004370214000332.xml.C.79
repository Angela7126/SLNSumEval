<a href="#0" id="0">Then, the energy of a given protein conformation, defined by a choice of one specific amino acid with an associated conformation (rotamer) for each residue, can be written as:{a mathematical formula} where E is the potential energy of the protein, {a mathematical formula}E ∅ is a constant energy contribution capturing interactions between fixed parts of the model, {a mathematical formula}E(ir) is the energy contribution of rotamer r at position i capturing internal interactions (and a reference energy for the associated amino acid) or interactions with fixed regions, and {a mathematical formula}E(ir,js) is the pairwise interaction energy between rotamer r at position i and rotamer s at position j[24].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP) is to find a complete assignment t minimizing the combined cost function {a mathematical formula} ⨁ wS ∈ WwS(t[S]), where {a mathematical formula}a ⊕ b=min(k,a+b) is the k-bounded addition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These values correspond to forbidden assignments because the sum of the corresponding binary term plus the two unary costs plus the current lower bound {a mathematical formula}E ∅ (produced by soft arc consistency) is greater than or equal to the current upper bound k. Such values s do not need to be considered by the min operation because {a mathematical formula}{ir,js} does not belong to any optimal solution, whereas {a mathematical formula}{iu,js} may.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Worst-cost differences are computed by the function {a mathematical formula}getDifference(j,i,u,r) applied to every binary cost function related to i, discarding forbidden assignments with {a mathematical formula}{ir,js} (line 8), as suggested by Eq.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For that, we define a new dynamic variable ordering heuristics selecting at each node of the search tree the variable minimizing the ratio of its current domain size divided by the sum of the median costs of all its current cost functions (including its unary cost function).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A compact encoding of the problem can be obtained using the ability of expressing the product of Boolean variables, getting rid of a quadratic number of {a mathematical formula}pirjs variables of the 01LP model.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To capture the fact that there is at most one value selected per domain, we penalize the simultaneous selection of every pair {a mathematical formula}ir,is of rotamers of the same variable i with a sufficiently large penalty M. To guarantee that at least one value will be selected in each domain, we shift all finite energies by a constant negative term N such that all shifted finite energies are strictly negative.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The solver is unique in all the solvers considered in that it does not use branching but only increasingly strong inference by applying reparametrizations to set of variables that initially contain only pairwise potentials, reasoning on stars [35], and are incrementally enlarged to include several potentials and strengthen the corresponding bound [81], [80].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">But the more important problem with this encoding is that with a quadratic number of extra variables, both minimaxsat and akmaxsat were extremely slow, exploring at most 2 nodes before the 9000-second time-out and in several instances timed out before even finishing the lower bound computation at the root node.</a>
