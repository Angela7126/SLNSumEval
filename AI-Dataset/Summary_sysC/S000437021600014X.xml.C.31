<a href="#1" id="1">Given a POMDP G with a reachability objective {a mathematical formula}Reach(T), a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ Σ is almost-sure winning iff {a mathematical formula}P Λ 0 Σ (Reach(T))=1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We will denote by {a mathematical formula}AlmostG(T) the set of almost-sure winning strategies in POMDP G for the objective {a mathematical formula}Reach(T).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a set U such that all states in U have the same observation, a strategy is almost-sure winning from U, if given the uniform probability distribution {a mathematical formula} Λ U over U we have {a mathematical formula}P Λ U Σ (Reach(T))=1; i.e., the strategy ensures almost-sure winning if the starting belief support is U.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Exact optimal cost problems: The problem {a mathematical formula}ExOptCost (resp., {a mathematical formula}ExOptAsCost) asks whether there exists a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ Σ (resp., {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ AlmostG(T)) such that {a mathematical formula}Val( Σ ) ≤ Λ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Proof</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given a POMDP G with positive costs, for every strategy Σ such that{a mathematical formula} Σ ∉ AlmostG(T)we have{a mathematical formula}Val( Σ )= ∞ .Consider {a mathematical formula} Σ ∉ AlmostG(T).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since the target set is not reached almost-surely, then there is a positive probability {a mathematical formula}p>0 that the target is never reached.</a>
