<a href="#0" id="0">Strictly groundedWe call {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Lstrictly grounded for O if there is no {a mathematical formula}y ∈ L such that {a mathematical formula}y<x and {a mathematical formula}(O(y) ∧ x) ≤ y.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consider the logic program {a mathematical formula}P:{a mathematical formula} This logic program has as immediate consequence operator {a mathematical formula}TP:{a mathematical formula} In this case, {a mathematical formula}{p} is a minimal fixpoint of {a mathematical formula}TP, but {a mathematical formula}{p} is not grounded since {a mathematical formula}TP({p} ∧ {q})=TP( ⊥ )={q}, while {a mathematical formula}{p} ≰ {q}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus y is a prefixpoint of O.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, {a mathematical formula}lfp(O) is the least prefixpoint of O, hence {a mathematical formula}lfp(O) ≤ y, and thus {a mathematical formula}y=lfp(O).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We conclude that {a mathematical formula}lfp(O) is indeed strictly grounded.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">From Proposition 3.3, it then follows that x is grounded as well.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consider the logic program {a mathematical formula}P:{a mathematical formula} This logic program has as immediate consequence operator {a mathematical formula}TP:{a mathematical formula} The operator {a mathematical formula}TP is anti-monotone, and {a mathematical formula}{p} is strictly grounded for {a mathematical formula}TP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, {a mathematical formula}{p} is not a postfixpoint of {a mathematical formula}TP.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The well-founded fixpoint{a mathematical formula}(u,v)of a symmetric approximator A of O approximates all grounded fixpoints of O.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A structure I is a grounded fixpoint of{a mathematical formula}TPif and only if it is a fixpoint of{a mathematical formula}TPand it has no proper 2-unfounded sets.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The grounded extension of Θ is the unique grounded fixpoint of{a mathematical formula}F Θ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">An interpretation S is a stable extension of Θ if and only if it is a grounded fixpoint of{a mathematical formula}U Θ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let{a mathematical formula} Ξ =(S,L,C)be an ADF.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Then{a mathematical formula}X ⊆ Sis a grounded fixpoint of{a mathematical formula}G Ξ if and only if X is a grounded model of Ξ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For the AEL theory {a mathematical formula}{Kp ⇒ p}, the possible world structure {a mathematical formula}{ ∅ ,{p}} is the well-founded and the unique stable extension.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">If Q is a strongly grounded AEL expansion of{a mathematical formula}T, then Q is a grounded expansion of{a mathematical formula}T.</a>
