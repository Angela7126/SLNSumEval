<a href="#0" id="0">Many state-of-the-art evolutionary vector optimization algorithms compute the contributing hypervolume for ranking candidate solutions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We briefly review results on Monte Carlo approximation of the least hypervolume contributor as well as the exact hypervolume algorithm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The contributing hypervolume of an individual {a mathematical formula}a âˆˆ A is given by{a mathematical formula} Note that the contributing hypervolume of a dominated individual is zero.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This can be done by {a mathematical formula}(|A|+1) hypervolume calculations with one of the many available hypervolume algorithms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This saves a factor of {a mathematical formula}|A| compared to most other hypervolume algorithms and gives a total runtime of {a mathematical formula}O(|A|m/2log(|A|)) to compute all {a mathematical formula}|A| hypervolume contributions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In our experiments we want to compare this exact calculation of the hypervolume with an approximation algorithm.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Though CON is therefore not approximable in time polynomial in {a mathematical formula}|A| and m, there are still a few approximation algorithms for CON (see [2], [8], [11]).</a>
