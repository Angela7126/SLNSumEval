<a href="#1" id="1">The type space {a mathematical formula} Θ i contains all possible behaviours for player i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Where do the hypothesised types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j ⁎ come from?</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, the results in this section pertain to a situation in which the user knows that the true type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ must be a subset of the hypothesised type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It can be shown that, under a pure type distribution and if HBA does not a priori rule out any of the types in {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ , then it will learn to make correct future predictions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The type {a mathematical formula} Θ A always chooses action A while {a mathematical formula} Θ B always chooses action B.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The type {a mathematical formula} Θ A always chooses action A while {a mathematical formula} Θ AB chooses actions A and B with equal probability.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Here, player 2 always chooses action A, since its type is always {a mathematical formula} Θ A.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since the types {a mathematical formula} Θ A and {a mathematical formula} Θ B always choose different actions and are completely deterministic (i.e.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Correlated type distributions can be used to specify constraints on type combinations, such as “ player j can only have type {a mathematical formula} Θ j if player k has type {a mathematical formula} Θ k ” .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We used HBA to control player 1 and a fixed type in each play to control player 2, which was included in the set of hypothesised types {a mathematical formula} Θ 2 ⁎ provided to HBA (discussed in detail in Section 5.6).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We used three different methods to automatically generate parameterised sets of types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ for any given game.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We specified a total of 10 different methods to automatically compute prior beliefs {a mathematical formula}Pj for a given set of types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ :</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Uniform prior The uniform prior sets {a mathematical formula}Pj( Θ j ⁎ )=| Θ j ⁎ | − 1 for all {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Random prior The random prior specifies {a mathematical formula}Pj( Θ j ⁎ )=0.0001 for a random half of the types in {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">the other player) is of type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ and player i (i.e.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Formally, let {a mathematical formula}Ukt( Θ j ⁎ | Θ j ′ ⁎ ) be like {a mathematical formula}Ukt( Θ j ⁎ ) except that HBA believes that player j is of type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ′ ⁎ instead of {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Section 3.1) Thus, the true type of player 2 was always included in the set of hypothesised types {a mathematical formula} Θ 2 ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Thus, the only difference between X and Y is that X can always predict the player types whereas Y approximates this knowledge through Pr and {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In our analysis, we will sometimes assume that the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical:</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Then, {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ is uncritical because HBA will always complete the task at {a mathematical formula}t=1, regardless of its posterior beliefs and despite the fact that {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ is inaccurate.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">We can show that Property 1 holds if the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i with positive expected payoff in X.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">We can show that Property 2 holds if the type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i which lead to states into which X may get as well.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We can show that Property 3 holds if the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i which X might have chosen as well.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">In this regard, we note that any combination of beliefs Pr and types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ can be described as a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j ⁎ of the form{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Analogously, we may combine the true types {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ⊂ Θ j of player j, using the type distribution ϒ , into a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j+ such that{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Note that this means that our method can be applied to the combination of beliefs and hypothesised types, as well as to individual types in {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The central question we ask is if {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ = Θ j+?</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">reject {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ if the p-value is below 0.01).</a>
