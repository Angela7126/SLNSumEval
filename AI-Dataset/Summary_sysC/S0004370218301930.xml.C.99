<a href="#0" id="0">Given the definition of players' states, the utility of player i for outcome v is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} Here, {a mathematical formula}K defines the maximal number of players in i's neighborhood which can affect player i's utility.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In other words, the player's utility grows with the number of players in her neighborhood that take the action, up to a limit of {a mathematical formula}K. Consequently, the tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 G,K,C1, … ,Cn 〉 defines a “ best-shot ” public goods game where G is an underlying interactions network, {a mathematical formula}K is the maximal number of public goods that can affect i's utility and {a mathematical formula}C1, … ,Cn are the costs for each player for taking the action.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The other state transition that improves the utility of a player, from {a mathematical formula}F1 to {a mathematical formula}T1; results in a change of {a mathematical formula}b − Δ − a to the potential share of player i that changed her strategy.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Player i has exactly one neighbor that performs the action, therefore player i's change of strategy changes the neighbor's share in the global potential by exactly − Δ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Combined with the incurred change of {a mathematical formula}b − Δ − a to the share of player i, the total change to the global potential is exactly {a mathematical formula}b − Δ − a − Δ , which in turn must be greater than 0 in order to satisfy the requirements of the global potential function.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The dashed line represents the border above which improving strategy changes are from {a mathematical formula}T to {a mathematical formula}F. Such a transition results in a change to the global potential of {a mathematical formula}a − b+2 ⋅ Δ +2 ⋅ Δ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This follows from the fact that the change to the potential share the player i that changed her strategy is {a mathematical formula}a − b+2 ⋅ Δ and the player has exactly two neighbors performing action, each of which adds Δ to her share in the global potential.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, in order to satisfy the requirements of the global potential function, the inequality {a mathematical formula}a − b+4 ⋅ Δ >0 (i.e., {a mathematical formula} Δ >b − a2) must hold.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To see this feature, observe first that in any optimum of the potential function players can only be in state {a mathematical formula}Tl<K or in state {a mathematical formula}Fl ≥ K.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Consider the inequality of Proposition 1{a mathematical formula} Combining this inequality with the fact that players in local maxima of the potential function (i.e., PNEs) are in state {a mathematical formula}Tl<K, one can conclude that each player in state {a mathematical formula}Tl contributes more to the potential than a player in state {a mathematical formula}Fl (i.e., {a mathematical formula}b − l ⋅ Δ >a).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For the sake of clarity we will first consider the case {a mathematical formula}K ≥ 2 and refer to the adjustments for the {a mathematical formula}K=1 case subsequently.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In case {a mathematical formula}K ≥ 2, Proposition 1 restricts the value of Δ to be in the range {a mathematical formula}b − a2 ⋅ K< Δ <b − a2 ⋅ (K − 1).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let us fix the value of Δ to be {a mathematical formula}(b − a) ⋅ 2 ⋅ K − 14 ⋅ (K − 1) ⋅ K, which is the center of the restricted range.Consider the case that the player's state, before changing her strategy, is {a mathematical formula}Fl<K.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In such a case, the change in the global potential, is {a mathematical formula}b − a − 2 ⋅ l ⋅ Δ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since the upper bound of l is {a mathematical formula}K − 1 and Δ is positive, the following inequality holds:{a mathematical formula}A change to the global potential of {a mathematical formula}a − b+2 ⋅ l ⋅ Δ will occur if the player's state before the strategy update is {a mathematical formula}Tl ≥ K.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Such a change results in the following inequality:{a mathematical formula}Consequently, the minimal improvement to the global potential, as a result of a better-response step, is {a mathematical formula}b − a2 ⋅ K when {a mathematical formula}K ≥ 2.In case {a mathematical formula}K=1 the only possible value of l is zero when the player's state is {a mathematical formula}Fl<K, which makes Equation (14) trivial.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">If the player's state before the strategy update is {a mathematical formula}Tl ≥ K, the value {a mathematical formula} Δ =b − a can be used to obtain the lower bound of {a mathematical formula}b − a2 ⋅ K.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For the simple version of the PGG where {a mathematical formula}K=1, it is shown next that the players' ability to propose payoff transfers enables the extended version of better-response dynamics to converge to a stable state of greater (or equal) efficiency than that of the initial, not necessarily stable, outcome.</a>
