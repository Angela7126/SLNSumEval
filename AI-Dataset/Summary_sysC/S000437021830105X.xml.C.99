<a href="#0" id="0">If we use cautious induction, we have to give examples which are either true in every answer set, or false in every answer set.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, we could not give any examples about the value predicate – for each atom {a mathematical formula}value(x,y) (where x and y range from 1 to 4), there is at least one answer set of {a mathematical formula}B ∪ H that contains {a mathematical formula}value(x,y) and at least one that does not; this means that if {a mathematical formula}value(x,y) is given as either a positive or negative example, H will not be a solution of the task.This means that for any {a mathematical formula}ILPc task {a mathematical formula}Tc such that H is a solution, any subset of the hypothesis space {a mathematical formula}SM is also a solution of {a mathematical formula}Tc.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is shown by Proposition 14.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For instance, {a mathematical formula}ILPLAS cannot distinguish between any two hypotheses that are strongly equivalent under the answer set semantics, but Example 15 shows that there are some cases where {a mathematical formula}ILPLFIT can.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First we will show that deciding the satisfiability of a general {a mathematical formula}ILPb task is in NP.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We do this by mapping an arbitrary task {a mathematical formula}T= 〈 B,SM, 〈 E+,E − 〉 〉 to an ASP program whose answer sets can be mapped to the solutions of T. This program will be satisfiable if and only if T is satisfiable and as the program is aggregate stratified, checking whether the program is satisfiable is in NP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, if we can construct such a program then we will have proved that deciding satisfiability for {a mathematical formula}ILPb is in NP.For each {a mathematical formula}Ri ∈ SM we define a new atom {a mathematical formula}in_hRi.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Also, let {a mathematical formula}meta(Ri) be the rule {a mathematical formula}Ri with the additional atom {a mathematical formula}in_hRi added to the body.We define the meta encoding {a mathematical formula}Tmeta as follows:{a mathematical formula}For any answer set A, let {a mathematical formula}M − 1(A)={Ri|Ri ∈ SM,in_hRi ∈ A}.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}A ∈ AS(Tmeta) if and only if {a mathematical formula}(A\{in_hRi|Ri ∈ SM}) ∈ AS(B ∪ M − 1(A) ∪ {:-note.|e ∈ E+} ∪ {:-e.|e ∈ E − }).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">(This can be seen by using the splitting set theorem, with {a mathematical formula}{in_hRi|Ri ∈ SM} as the splitting set.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">)Hence {a mathematical formula}A ∈ AS(Tmeta) if and only if {a mathematical formula} ∃ H ⊆ SM such that {a mathematical formula}H=M − 1(A), {a mathematical formula}(A\{in_hRi|Ri ∈ SM}) ∈ AS(B ∪ H) and A respects the examples.Hence {a mathematical formula}Tmeta is satisfiable if and only if {a mathematical formula} ∃ H ⊆ SM such that {a mathematical formula} ∃ A ∈ AS(B ∪ H) such that A respects the examples.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This is the case if and only if T is satisfiable.It remains to show that deciding the satisfiability of a general {a mathematical formula}ILPb task is NP-hard.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Deciding the satisfiability of a normal logic program is NP-hard, so demonstrating that a deciding the satisfiability of a normal program P can be mapped to a {a mathematical formula}ILPb task is sufficient.Let P be any normal logic program.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let T be the {a mathematical formula}ILPb task {a mathematical formula} 〈 P, ∅ , 〈 ∅ , ∅ 〉 〉 .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">T is satisfiable if and only if {a mathematical formula} ∃ H ⊆ ∅ such that {a mathematical formula} ∃ A ∈ AS(P ∪ H) such that {a mathematical formula} ∅ ⊆ A and {a mathematical formula}A ∩ ∅ = ∅ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This is true if and only if P is satisfiable.Hence, deciding the satisfiability of a general {a mathematical formula}ILPb task is NP-complete.</a>
