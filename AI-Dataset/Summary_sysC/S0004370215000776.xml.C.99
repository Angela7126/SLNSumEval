<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}O, then there exists a {a mathematical formula}(X ′ ,Y ′ ) with {a mathematical formula}(X,Y) ≤ i(X ′ ,Y ′ ) which is preferred with respect to {a mathematical formula}O and where {a mathematical formula}s ∈ X ′ by Theorem 3.3.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since any preferred pair is also complete and any complete pair is also admissible the claim follows.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By assumption,{a mathematical formula} Define {a mathematical formula}El=E ∩ Zu¯l and {a mathematical formula}Er=E ∩ Zu¯r.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We begin with the case for {a mathematical formula}O=U Ξ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It holds that {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ X ∪ {s} ⊆ Y, {a mathematical formula}X ∪ {s} ⊭ Φ p, and {a mathematical formula}X ∪ {s} ⊭ Φ -p.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus {a mathematical formula}p,-p ∉ U Ξ ′ (X,Y).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ U Ξ ′ (X,Y) we can infer that {a mathematical formula}p,-p ∉ X.Suppose {a mathematical formula}p ∈ (S ∖ Y).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By definition of admissibility we have {a mathematical formula}p ∉ U Ξ ″ (X,Y).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Then for all Z with {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ Z ⊆ Y we have {a mathematical formula}Z ⊭ Φ p.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It holds that {a mathematical formula}Z ⊭ Φ p iff {a mathematical formula}s ∈ Z or {a mathematical formula}-p ∈ Z.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Now{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} For acceptance functions represented by propositional formulas, {a mathematical formula}Cs(X ∩ par(s))=t can be decided in polynomial time, since we only have to check whether {a mathematical formula}X ⊨ Φ s.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">These results can also be formulated in terms of partial evaluations of acceptance formulas: We have {a mathematical formula}s ∈ G Ξ ′ (X,Y) iff the partial evaluation {a mathematical formula} Φ s(X,Y) is a formula without variables that evaluates to t. Similarly, we have {a mathematical formula}s ∈ G Ξ ″ (X,Y)=U Ξ ″ (X,Y) iff the partial evaluation {a mathematical formula} Φ s(X,Y) is satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Under standard complexity assumptions, computing a new lower bound with the ultimate operator is harder than with the approximate operator.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This is because, intuitively, {a mathematical formula}s ∈ U Ξ ′ (X,Y) iff the partial evaluation {a mathematical formula} Φ s(X,Y) is a tautology.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Further let {a mathematical formula}(X,Y) ∈ Ac and {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S.Using the same line of reasoning as in the proof of Lemma 3.17 we can immediately infer that under the assumptions of the current theorem that {a mathematical formula}RevBound ⊇ I ′ is in {a mathematical formula} Σ iP, {a mathematical formula}RevBound ⊆ I ′ is in {a mathematical formula} Π iP, {a mathematical formula}RevBound ⊆ I ″ is in {a mathematical formula} Σ iP, {a mathematical formula}RevBound ⊇ I ″ is in {a mathematical formula} Π iP.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For {a mathematical formula}DP-hardness, as for the approximate operator, consider the proof of Proposition 4.11.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For {a mathematical formula}I=U, the proof is analogous to the one above – we show {a mathematical formula}NP-completeness of the complementary problem.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The complexity results we have obtained so far might lead the reader to ask why we bother with the approximate operator {a mathematical formula}G Ξ at all: the ultimate operator {a mathematical formula}U Ξ is at least as precise and for all admissibility-based and most conflict-free-based semantics considered up to now, it has the same computational costs.</a>
