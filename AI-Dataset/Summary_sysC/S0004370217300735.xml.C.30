<a href="#0" id="0">In the third step, line 3 is executed again to learn a flat LTM for the level 1 latent variables, resulting the model shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">3(b).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To perform UD-test on a set {a mathematical formula}S of observed variables, we first learn two latent tree models {a mathematical formula}m1 and {a mathematical formula}m2 for {a mathematical formula}S and then compare their BIC scores.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The model {a mathematical formula}m1 is the model with the highest BIC score among all LTMs with a single latent variable, and the model {a mathematical formula}m2 is the model with the highest BIC score among all LTMs with two latent variables.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let W be the variable in {a mathematical formula}S that has the highest MI with the variable X to be added to the island.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For {a mathematical formula}m2, we choose the model where one latent variable is connected to the variables in {a mathematical formula}S âˆ– {W} and the second latent variable connected to W and X.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Both latent variables are binary and the model parameters are optimized by a fast subroutine Pem-Ltm-2l that will be described in the next section.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Among all the other variables, mission has highest MI with the three variables in the model.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To decide whether mission should be added to the group, the two models {a mathematical formula}m1 and {a mathematical formula}m2 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">At line 14, OneIsland adds X to the m to create a new LTM {a mathematical formula}m2 with two latent variables.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The parameters of {a mathematical formula}m2 are estimated using the subroutine Pem-Ltm-2l (Algorithm 6),{sup:2} which is also an application of progressive EM.</a>
