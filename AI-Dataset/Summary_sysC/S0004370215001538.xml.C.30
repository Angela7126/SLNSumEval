<a href="#0" id="0">While some computational models of intelligence test problems were proposed throughout the second half of the XXth century, in the first years of the XXIst century we have seen an increasing number of computer systems being able to score well on particular intelligence test tasks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The diversity of goals and approaches has also widened, including the use of intelligence tests for the analysis of what intelligence is, for the understanding of certain aspects of human cognition, for the evaluation of some AI techniques or systems, including robots, and, simply, to have more insights about what intelligence tests really represent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We will use the term computer model for all these approaches, independently of their purpose, of the employed techniques, and of the range of problems they are able to address.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">With the exception of big switch approaches, like the one of Sanghi and Dowe [15], current systems are based on algorithmic approaches specifically designed to solve a special class of such problems and even only one specific test.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is an open question whether a general algorithmic approach for a diverse set of intelligence tests can be designed in principle.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Comparing the current situation of computer models which solve intelligence tests with the history of game playing, it took about 55 years before the rise of general game playing.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In other words, these cognitive approaches are not meant to build systems that are able to perform well (or perfectly) in some tasks (or even in intelligence test problems), but rather that perform in the same way humans do, solving problems that humans usually solve but also failing at problems where humans fail.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this section, we will briefly review some of the tasks that appear in intelligence tests and similar tests.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We refer to some of these tests as ‘ similar ’ to intelligence test because those tests do not originate from psychometrics but from AI or cognitive science, and have never been used to evaluate humans systematically.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Nonetheless, they are similar (intentionally or not) to human intelligence tests, and we think it is worth taking them into consideration.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Apart from possibly being useful as benchmarks, these models are usually proposed as tools to improve our understanding of intelligence.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In particular, the third question (Q3) is: Are computer models for solving intelligence test problems useful for understanding human cognition?</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Our fifth question (Q5) is: What is the correspondence between the areas in AI and the abilities covered in intelligence tests?</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We are interested in the techniques and algorithms they use, in order to determine which areas in AI are most useful for these tests.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In particular, we want to know whether they are those subdisciplines in AI that deal with more general problems, such as machine learning.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As a result, the analysis of this work has to be done in terms of the specialisation of the techniques that were used, their performance and the range of problems, hence raising important doubts about the use of intelligence tests for evaluating AI systems.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">A crucial difference that makes systems distinctive is not only the kind of problems they solve, but also the great deal of techniques that have been used for solving the same or different intelligence tests.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Nonetheless this can also be seen as an opportunity of computer models, AI, and other approaches based on information theory, to help improving intelligence tests.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">If we look at Table 1 and especially Table 2, we see a correspondence between AI subdisciplines and cognitive abilities.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">However, if we look at the models and the techniques through Table 4 and Fig.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">4, it seems that there is no clear correspondence between the kind of problem and the techniques from AI that have been used to solve it.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">There is again more prevalence of techniques related to inductive reasoning, but some specialised techniques have also been used in some problems to circumvent this need.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">But humans are not programmed to do intelligence tests.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Only for a few cases (such as Spaun, but with many limitations and just some kinds of tasks), the system is trained to solve intelligence test tasks.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">It includes some tasks that are very similar to the problems we may find in intelligence tests.</a>
