<a href="#0" id="0">Suppose {a mathematical formula}x ∉ X is satisfied.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Considering the definition of {a mathematical formula}X in (16), this implies that a is supported in {a mathematical formula}c1 ∧ 2, or formally{a mathematical formula} Based on Invar1 we know that {a mathematical formula}c1 ∧ 2(x,y → ),Dx ′ ,Dy ‾ ′ ⊨ ⊥ , and hence {a mathematical formula} ∀ x ∈ Dx ′ ¬ ∃ y → ∈ Dy ‾ ′ .c1 ∧ 2(x,y → ), and particularly for {a mathematical formula}x=a, {a mathematical formula}¬ ∃ y → ∈ Dy ‾ ′ .c1 ∧ 2(a,y → ), which contradicts (18).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now suppose {a mathematical formula} ∃ x ′ ∈ X.c1 ∧ 2(x ′ ,y → ) is satisfied.</a>
