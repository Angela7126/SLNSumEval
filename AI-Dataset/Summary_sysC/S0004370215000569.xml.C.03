<a href="#0" id="0">In what follows, we write {a mathematical formula} Γ m for the minimal network of Γ , and {a mathematical formula} Γ p for the a-closure of Γ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then it is easy to show that {a mathematical formula} Γ k is a prime subnetwork of Γ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is straightforward to show that {a mathematical formula} Γ k is a prime subnetwork of Γ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We call {a mathematical formula} Γ c the core of Γ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Suppose Γ is the RCC5 network specified as below{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}P={PP,EQ}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Suppose {a mathematical formula} Γ ⊨ (viEQvj).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show {a mathematical formula}(viEQvj) is in {a mathematical formula} Γ p.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula} Γ p is exactly {a mathematical formula} Γ m.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider the network Γ over {a mathematical formula}H5 shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Suppose Γ is an RCC5/8 network over a distributive subalgebra {a mathematical formula}S and {a mathematical formula} Γ p its a-closure.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Write {a mathematical formula}(xTy) for the constraint between x and y in {a mathematical formula} Γ p ′ , the a-closure of {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Consider the constraint network Γ over {a mathematical formula}H5 shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Then {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ entails {a mathematical formula}(xRy).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In other words, each solution of {a mathematical formula} Γ ″ is a solution of Γ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}(xSy) is redundant in {a mathematical formula} Γ p.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Consider the constraint network Γ over {a mathematical formula}H5 shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">It is clear that the constraint {a mathematical formula}(v3PPv2) is redundant in {a mathematical formula} Γ p.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Note that {a mathematical formula}ci+1 is also in {a mathematical formula} Γ i.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">By Proposition 28 we know {a mathematical formula}(xSy) is redundant in {a mathematical formula} Γ m since {a mathematical formula}(xRy) is redundant in Γ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}i=k and {a mathematical formula} Γ c is equivalent to Γ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The core {a mathematical formula} Γ c (shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">This is because {a mathematical formula}(v3DRv2) is feasible in {a mathematical formula} Γ c but not in Γ .</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Suppose {a mathematical formula}(xSy) is redundant in {a mathematical formula} Γ p.</a>
