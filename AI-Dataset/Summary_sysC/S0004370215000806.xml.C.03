<a href="#0" id="0">To our knowledge, there is no exact algorithm that supports user constraints with any of those criteria with {a mathematical formula}k>2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each solution is a partition with at most {a mathematical formula}kmax clusters.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the user needs exactly k clusters, all he/she has to do is to set {a mathematical formula}kmin=kmax=k.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The constraint {a mathematical formula}S ≥ Δ is also put.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Some variables {a mathematical formula}Gi have been instantiated.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let us consider a constrained clustering task with a set {a mathematical formula}C of user constraints, which is possibly empty.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore each partition {a mathematical formula} Δ iS is Pareto optimal.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The value of k is set to the ground truth number of clusters given in Table 2 (in the new model {a mathematical formula}kmin=kmax=k).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Without user-constraints, the optimal solution with the diameter criterion has always a number of clusters equal to {a mathematical formula}kmax.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To our knowledge, there is no exact algorithm for this criterion that supports any kind of user constraints for a general value {a mathematical formula}k ≥ 3.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">When optimizing the split without user constraints, when the number k of clusters is not set ({a mathematical formula}kmin ≤ k ≤ kmax), the optimal solution has always a number of clusters equal to {a mathematical formula}kmin.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To our knowledge, this is the only exact algorithm for {a mathematical formula}k ∈ [kmin,kmax].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We can see that without user constraints, there are many points in the Pareto front but all of them are very far from {a mathematical formula}(Dr,Sr).</a>
