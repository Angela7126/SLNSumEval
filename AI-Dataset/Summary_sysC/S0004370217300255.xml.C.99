<a href="#0" id="0">⋆ -consolidationLet Γ be a knowledge base in {a mathematical formula}K and {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ be a subclassical, Tarskian consequence operation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A ⋆ -consolidation of Γ is any consistent set {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ ⊆ Cn ⋆ ( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For instance, using the classical consequence operation Cn, an inconsistent {a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ K would imply {a mathematical formula}Cn( Γ )=L, and any consistent knowledge base could be the ⋆ -consolidation of Γ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">That is why we focus on strictly subclassical {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If we want to restrict ⋆ -consolidations to contain only formulas that are weaker than those in the original knowledge base, {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ must be modular.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the first case, {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ is the identity function, and ⋆ -innocuous formulas are equal to free formulas, due to the characterisation given by Proposition 4.2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Any finite knowledge base{a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ Kis a ⋆ -conflict iff it is inconsistent and it does not contain valid formulas.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As the concept of minimal inconsistent set induces the definition of “ uncontroversial ” formulas (i.e., the free formulas), we can also characterise “ uncontroversial ” formulas using ⋆ -conflicts, which would contain the “ controversial ” ones.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider a knowledge base{a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ Kand a modular{a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ :K → K.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A formula{a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Γ is ⋆ -innocuous in Γ iff it is in no ⋆ -conflict of Γ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The result above shows that, given a modular consequence operation {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ , the formulas in a knowledge base Γ can be split into two groups: the formulas involved in some ⋆ -conflict; and the ⋆ -innocuous formulas, which are consistent with any ⋆ -consolidation {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ ∈ Cn ⋆ ( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As a consequence, due to Proposition 4.10, while ⋆ -consolidating a knowledge base, one can focus on the formulas involved in the ⋆ -conflicts, ignoring ⋆ -innocuous formulas, in the same way that AGM-consolidation can focus on the union of the MISes, ignoring free formulas:</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In contrast, with non-modular consequence operations, a set of formulas may be needed to derive each element in the hidden conflict, as it happens with {a mathematical formula}x2 in Example 5.14.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Thus, given a {a mathematical formula} Δ ∈ MIS(Cn ⋆ ( Γ )), we look for the premises in Γ involved in the derivation of each formula in Δ in order to project the conflict onto the knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">⋆ -free formulas: those not involved in the derivation of (i.e., that do not belong to a minimal set of premises for deriving) a formula in a minimal inconsistent subset of the {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ -closure.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As we have shown, both concepts are equivalent for a modular consequence operation {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ , which seems to be the most useful case.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Using the consequence operations {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ =CnPm or {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ =Cn2Pm, introduced in Section 6.2, we can again employ the ⋆ -free formula concept to identify the formulas that do not contribute to the base's degree of inconsistency.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">As proved in Section 6.2, the corresponding ⋆ -conflict definitions captures the subsets of a base that are the union of minimal proofs of both {a mathematical formula}xi and {a mathematical formula}¬xi, for some {a mathematical formula}xi.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Consequently, the corresponding ⋆ -free formulas yield ( ⋆ -Independence) properties suitable for {a mathematical formula}IPm:</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">To grasp the consequences of the proposition above, consider an inconsistent base {a mathematical formula} Γ ={ Φ 1, … , Φ m} formed by consistent formulas.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Let {a mathematical formula} Φ i ′ ∉ Γ be a formula equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Φ i, for {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≤ m, and define {a mathematical formula} Δ ={ Φ 1 ′ , … , Φ m ′ }.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Towards that aim, we can prove that the general inconsistency measures {a mathematical formula}I ⋆ and {a mathematical formula}I ⋆ C, based on arbitrary ⋆ -conflicts, satisfy the corresponding version of the dominance property, for the corresponding {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In other words, the version of dominance satisfied by {a mathematical formula}IMIS is based on a very weak modular consequence operation: for a consistent Φ , {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ ({ Φ }) contains only tautologies besides formulas equivalent to Φ .</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">In this section, we discuss this matter, providing computational complexity bounds for the problems of recognising ⋆ -free/innocuous formulas and ⋆ -conflicts, given some assumptions on the corresponding consequence operation {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">When {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ is modular, ⋆ -FREE and ⋆ -INNOCUOUS are the same language, thus in the same complexity class.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">In the general case, however, the {a mathematical formula}Cn ⋆ being p-bounded seems not enough to put ⋆ -INNOCUOUS in {a mathematical formula} Π 2p, though an extra restriction could suffice: that for any ⋆ -innocuous formula Φ in Γ there is a polynomial-sized {a mathematical formula} Δ ∈ MIS(Cn ⋆ ( Γ )) containing Φ .</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">{a mathematical formula}ICsatisfies (Dominance ′ ).Consider a knowledge base {a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ K and two formulas {a mathematical formula} Φ , Ψ ∈ L ∖ Γ such that {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊢ Ψ and {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊬ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">We prove that each {a mathematical formula} Δ ⊆ ( Γ ∪ { Ψ }) in {a mathematical formula}C corresponds to a different {a mathematical formula} Δ ′ ⊆ ( Γ ∪ { Φ }) in {a mathematical formula}C. Let {a mathematical formula} Δ ∈ C be a subset of {a mathematical formula} Γ ∪ { Ψ }.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">There are two cases to consider: {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∈ Δ and {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∉ Δ .</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">If {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∉ Δ , then {a mathematical formula} Δ ⊆ Γ and {a mathematical formula} Δ ⊆ Γ and {a mathematical formula} Δ ⊆ Γ ∪ { Φ }.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Thus, we focus on an arbitrary {a mathematical formula} Δ ⊆ Γ ∪ { Ψ } such that {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∈ Δ .</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">As {a mathematical formula} Δ ∈ C, it is inconsistent and contains no valid formulas.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Since Ψ is in a Δ , it is not valid, and neither is Φ , for {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊢ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Hence, {a mathematical formula} Δ ′ =( Δ ∖ { Ψ }) ∪ { Φ } contains no valid formulas.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Furthermore, as {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊢ Ψ , {a mathematical formula} Δ ′ is also inconsistent and in {a mathematical formula}C. Finally, {a mathematical formula} Γ ∪ { Φ } has at least the same number of subsets in {a mathematical formula}C as {a mathematical formula} Γ ∪ { Ψ } has, {a mathematical formula}IC( Γ ∪ { Φ }) ≥ IC( Γ ∪ { Ψ }) and (Dominance ′ ) is satisfied.</a>
