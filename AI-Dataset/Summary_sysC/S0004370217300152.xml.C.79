<a href="#0" id="0">The problem is now to determine the most promising alternative under parameter uncertainty {a mathematical formula} Θ P.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we adopt an incremental elicitation procedure based on minimax regret in order to acquire the most relevant information about the Choquet capacity representing the DM's preferences (capacity v taking the role of parameter Θ for the Choquet integral {a mathematical formula}Cv).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section, we focus our discussion on the Choquet integral model; in that case, {a mathematical formula} Θ P is the set of all capacities v compatible with {a mathematical formula}P. Any preference statement of type “ a is preferred to b ” will be interpreted as a constraint of type {a mathematical formula}Cv(a) ≥ Cv(b) restricting the initial admissible set of capacities Θ , where {a mathematical formula}Cv is defined by Equation (1).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that, for any normalized capacity v and any set {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, we have:{a mathematical formula} This is due to the fact that all “ bottom ” criteria precede all “ top ” criteria in the permutation, and so the difference of performance between any two successive criteria is equal to zero, except for the last “ bottom ” criterion and the first “ top ” criterion, which is equal to one (refer to Definition 3).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consequently, Equation (9) can be replaced by boundary constraints over decision variables; indeed, to ensure that the set-function v is compatible with {a mathematical formula}P, it is sufficient to update the boundaries of an interval {a mathematical formula}[lA,uA] whenever a preference involving {a mathematical formula}1A0 is inserted in {a mathematical formula}P; note that {a mathematical formula}l ∅ =u ∅ =0, {a mathematical formula}lN=uN=1 due to the normalization constraint, and initially, we have {a mathematical formula}[lA,uA]=[0,1] for all proper subsets A of N.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For any set of criteria {a mathematical formula}A ∈ A(x,y), let {a mathematical formula} Ω A denote the coefficient of the decision variable {a mathematical formula}vA in the objective function of linear program LP2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, the objective function can be written {a mathematical formula} ∑ A ∈ A(x,y) Ω AvA where:{a mathematical formula} Note that we cannot have {a mathematical formula}X(i)=Y(j) if i is different from j since these level sets can only be equal if they have the same cardinality.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note also that all variables {a mathematical formula}vA,A ∈ A(x,y), such that {a mathematical formula} Ω A=0 have no impact on the objective function of program LP2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This proposition enables us to derive the following result: Any optimal solution of LP{a mathematical formula}2 ′ is optimal for LP2.Let v be an optimal solution of program LP{a mathematical formula}2 ′ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, it is sufficient to impose:{a mathematical formula} This leads to the following simplified formulation:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Hence, we now use at most {a mathematical formula}2n − 1 variables (one per element of {a mathematical formula}A(x,y)) linked by at most {a mathematical formula}3(n − 1) monotonicity constraints.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the previous subsections, we have shown that, assuming that preference statements are of types {a mathematical formula}(1A0, Λ ) or {a mathematical formula}( Λ ,1A0), we are able to efficiently compute minimax regret values.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Note that the determination of the next query implies to select {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ within the {a mathematical formula}2n − 2 possible proper subsets of N, a number which increases significantly with the number of criteria.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To make this query generation step more efficient, as a heuristic we propose to focus on sets directly involved in the computation of {a mathematical formula}PMR(x ⁎ ,y ⁎ , Θ P), where {a mathematical formula}x ⁎ is an optimal alternative for the mMR criterion knowing {a mathematical formula}P, and {a mathematical formula}y ⁎ is one of its adversary's choices.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Asking the DM to compare the binary alternative {a mathematical formula}1A0 to the constant utility profile {a mathematical formula} Λ =( Λ , … , Λ ) cannot generate any contradiction because the answer will induce one of the two constraints “ {a mathematical formula}v(A) ≤ Λ ” or “ {a mathematical formula}v(A) ≥ Λ ” .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Indeed, we have {a mathematical formula} Θ P ′ ⊆ Θ P for any set of preference statements {a mathematical formula}P ′ ⊇ P; then, for any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X and any {a mathematical formula} ℓ ∈ {1, … ,q}, we have:{a mathematical formula} and so, the maximum minimax regret cannot increase by adding new preference statements; in the subsection devoted to numerical tests, we will see that, in practice, it strictly decreases when queries are chosen in a reasoned way.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In linear program LP4 allowing to compute {a mathematical formula}fx ⊤ and {a mathematical formula}fx ⊥ for a given x, we notice that the set of variables involved in the objective function is the set {a mathematical formula}Ax of all level sets of x, i.e.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">More precisely, we have seen that if we restrict ourself to preference queries that ask to compare a binary alternative with a constant utility profile, then preference constraints (Equations (30), (31)) can be replaced by boundary constraints of type {a mathematical formula}lA ≤ vA ≤ uA for all subsets of criteria {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, where {a mathematical formula}lA ≤ lB and {a mathematical formula}uA ≤ uB for all {a mathematical formula}A ⊂ B ⊆ N.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Using Proposition 1 with {a mathematical formula}A=Ax, from the linear program we can remove all monotonicity constraints involving a variable {a mathematical formula}vA that is not present in the objective function of Equation (26) (i.e.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In fact, for a given set {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, the determination of the optimal value {a mathematical formula} Λ A can be easily performed using a bisection algorithm, applying similar arguments to those of Section 3.4.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We do not report computation times since we have already seen that optimization with preference statements of types {a mathematical formula}(1A0, Λ ) or {a mathematical formula}( Λ ,1A0) is very efficient, due to the reduced number of monotonicity constraints.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">To do so, it is sufficient to prove by induction that the following statement, denoted by {a mathematical formula}P(i), holds at the end of any step {a mathematical formula}i ∈ {0, … ,|A − |} of the ‘ for ’ loop: “ The instantiation of the variables in {a mathematical formula}{vAk − ,1 ≤ k ≤ i} , denoted by {a mathematical formula}Ii, can be extended to an optimal solution of program LP3. ” If statement {a mathematical formula}P(i) is true for {a mathematical formula}i=|A − |, then it enables us to establish the result: the instantiation of all negative variables (i.e.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">{a mathematical formula}{vA:A ∈ A − }) can be extended to an optimal instantiation, while the remaining variables, which are those with a positive impact on the objective function (i.e.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">As a consequence, since instantiation {a mathematical formula}Ii − 1 can be extended to an optimal solution of program LP3 (by induction hypothesis), we can impose {a mathematical formula}vDji ≤ uji while still being able to find an optimal solution of program LP3.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Hence, we can find an optimal solution of LP3 by solving the following problem:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}f(u,A(x,y)) denotes the optimal solution of the following subproblem:{a mathematical formula} We now aim to show that there exists an optimal solution of program LP3 that extends instantiation {a mathematical formula}Ii − 1 while verifying {a mathematical formula}vAi − =vDji=uji.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">As a consequence, variables {a mathematical formula}vA,A ∈ s(Dji)m − , can be substituted by {a mathematical formula}vDmi in the optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">More precisely, {a mathematical formula}g(u,s(Dji)) can be computed by solving the following problem:{a mathematical formula} Note that this optimization problem only involves the positive variables {a mathematical formula}vDmi,m ∈ {1, … ,j}.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}vD1i must be larger than or equal to {a mathematical formula}vD2i due to Equation (19), then we know that there exists an optimal solution such that {a mathematical formula}vD1i=max ⁡ {lD1i,vD2i}; then, since {a mathematical formula}vD2i ≥ u (by definition of g) and {a mathematical formula}u ≥ lD1i (by hypothesis), we can conclude {a mathematical formula}vD1i=vD2i.</a>
