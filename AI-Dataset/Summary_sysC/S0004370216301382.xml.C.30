<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we present a new SLS algorithm named CCEHC (Configuration Checking with Emphasis on Hard Clauses) for solving WPMS.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our CCEHC algorithm employs an extended framework of CCLS with a heuristic emphasizing hard clauses, called EHC.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">With strong focus on hard clauses, the EHC heuristic has three components: a variable selection mechanism focusing on a forbidding mechanism of configuration checking based only on hard clauses, a weighting scheme for hard clauses, and an approach of biased random walk.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To evaluate the efficiency and the robustness of our CCEHC algorithm, we compare CCEHC against CCLS, Dist and DistUP on a broad range of WPMS benchmarks including the random, crafted and industrial benchmarks from the MAX-SAT Evaluation 2014 as well as four real-world application benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Experimental results clearly show that CCEHC generally performs much better than CCLS, Dist and DistUP, and thus establishes a new state of the art on SLS algorithms for solving WPMS.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also conduct more experiments to study the performance variability of SLS algorithms on selected instances.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this subsection, we conduct extensive experiments of our CCEHC algorithm and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors, i.e., DistUP, Dist and CCLS on all testing benchmarks, i.e., the MSE2014_WPMS_Random, MSE2014_WPMS_Crafted and MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmarks and four real-world application WPMS benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The comparative results of CCEHC and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors DistUP, Dist and CCLS on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and four real-world application WPMS benchmarks are summarized in Table 4.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">According to the empirical results presented in Table 4, although CCEHC performs slightly slower than CCLS on the benchmark of advanced encryption standard and performs slightly slower than DistUP and Dist on the benchmark of cluster expansion, it is very apparent that, among these four competing SLS algorithms, our CCEHC algorithm performs best on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and two real-world application WPMS benchmarks (i.e., ‘ Computational Protein Design ’ and ‘ Pedigree ’ ).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Particularly, the related experimental results indicate that our CCEHC algorithm is able to return better-quality solutions compared to CCLS, Dist and DistUP on a large number of real-world application instances.</a>
