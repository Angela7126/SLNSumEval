<a href="#0" id="0">Therefore, the number of learnable target options is equal to the total number of learnable abstractions, which is at most equal to the number of input exploratory options:{a mathematical formula} To enable continual learning[29], the number of skills acquired by the agent should not necessarily be bounded and the agent needs to reuse the previously acquired skills to learn more complex skills.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If the estimation error of any already learned abstraction modules for the incoming observations is lower than threshold Δ , the exploratory-option's policy is learned using Least-Squares Policy Iteration Technique (LSPI; [53]), with an estimation of the transition model actively updated over the option's state-space {a mathematical formula}Iie ⊆ S Φ , and an estimated reward function that rewards high estimation errors.</a>
