<a href="#0" id="0">Section 2 overviews a range of theoretical approaches to concept combination from the literature, and summarises the results from experimental studies that we aim to model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Section 3 describes a random set and prototype theory representational model for concepts within a conceptual space.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This model provides the theoretical underpinning for our work.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Section 4 introduces a framework for concept combination based on a hierarchy of conceptual spaces, and in which compound concepts are defined within Boolean spaces.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We prove a number of results showing the properties of this framework and compare this approach to others in the literature.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Section 5 provides a discussion of our results and indicates possible future directions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A fuzzy set L is defined over a universe Ω via a membership function {a mathematical formula} Μ L: Ω → [0,1].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Elements {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Ω that are very good examples of the concept L have membership close to 1, whereas elements x that are bad examples of the concept have membership close to 0.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The conjunction of two fuzzy sets is defined purely extensionally, for example {a mathematical formula} Μ L1 ∧ L2(x)=min( Μ L1(x), Μ L2(x)), where {a mathematical formula}min(a,b) indicates the minimum of the two values a and b.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then, overextension of conjunctions of concepts cannot be explained using standard conjunction operators within fuzzy set theory [25], [27], [40].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Two key examples of this are the conjunction fallacy [47] and the ‘ guppy effect ’ [40].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The conjunction fallacy is that humans often judge more specific conditions as more probable than more general conditions.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For example, one might judge a bicycle that has been painted with polka dots to be more typical of the combined concept ‘ polka dot bicycle ’ than of the concept ‘ bicycle ’ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We will argue that our proposed model of concepts and concept combination can also account for these phenomena.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Each label {a mathematical formula}Li is entirely defined by its prototype {a mathematical formula}Pi, the distance metric in the space {a mathematical formula}d(x,y) and the distribution {a mathematical formula} Δ i of the threshold {a mathematical formula} Ε i.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We can therefore, given a particular conceptual space Ω , use the notation {a mathematical formula}Li=<Pi,di, Δ i> to completely describe the label {a mathematical formula}Li.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The idea of a membership function presented here may be compared with the similarity relation that Gärdenfors uses.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">A similarity relation between points in a conceptual space may be defined as a decreasing function of distance in the space.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Gärdenfors gives the example that the similarity {a mathematical formula}s(x,y) between two points x and y in the conceptual space is an exponentially decaying function of the distance {a mathematical formula}d(x,y) between the two points, i.e.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">{a mathematical formula}s(x,y)=exp ⁡ ( − cd(x,y)).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In terms of the prototype-threshold approach outlined above, the membership of an element x in a concept L may then be defined as the similarity to the prototype P of L, where {a mathematical formula} Ε ∼ Exp(c).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">More generally, {a mathematical formula}s(x,y)= Δ (d(x,y)).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">So an attribute like ‘ rounded ’ is seen as a label based in a space such as {a mathematical formula}R3, or ‘ red ’ as based in the CIELab colour space.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">From this perspective, each of the attribute labels can form a binary dimension which are then combined to form the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n where n is the number of attributes.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Within this binary space, we take the value 1 on a particular dimension to mean that an object has that particular property.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">4 gives a schematic representation of this model, within which we treat the combination space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}nitself as a conceptual space with an associated metric.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">We think of the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n as the binary conjunction space, and of {a mathematical formula}x → Α as the prototype of the conjunctive concept Α .</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">We also allow some deviation from the prototype by taking into account the different levels of importance of each label {a mathematical formula}Li.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The differing importance of the labels is characterised by a weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → which weights each dimension in the binary space.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">We can now consider membership in the conjunctive concept within the binary space.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">A conjunctive concept is defined by the triple {a mathematical formula} Α =<x → Α ,d, Δ > where Α is an atom of LA, d is a distance on {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n, Ε is a random variable in {a mathematical formula}R+ and Δ is a probability distribution on Ε .</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">We say that an element {a mathematical formula}X → ∈ {0,1}n can be appropriately described by the concept Α iff {a mathematical formula}d(x → Α ,X → ) ≤ Ε with the membership function defined by:{a mathematical formula} We can then relate membership in {a mathematical formula} Ω 1× Ω 2×...× Ω n to membership in the binary space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n as follows.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">We now define a distance metric in the binary space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n based on Hamming distance and a weight vector.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">One dimensional Hamming distance{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">We now outline a correspondence between our idea of a compound concept as a conjunction of attribute labels or their negations, and Hampton's account of concepts as combinations of attributes with individual weights.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Firstly, as stated above, we model individual attributes as labels from conceptual spaces such as the colour space, or the taste space.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">We have a vector of weights, {a mathematical formula} Λ → , attached to the binary space which loosely corresponds to Hampton's attribute weights.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">However, the weights in Hampton's account range from 4, being necessary, to − 2, being impossible.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">In contrast, our weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → is always positive, and the idea of an attribute {a mathematical formula}Li being atypical or impossible is captured by the notion that the conjunction {a mathematical formula} ⋀ i=1n±Li includes {a mathematical formula}¬Li.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">The extent of the atypicality of the attribute {a mathematical formula}Li is then given by the weight {a mathematical formula} Λ i of the corresponding dimension.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">The example above shows that the membership functions generated within this framework can be very flexible.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">However, we show that by restricting the type of membership function used in the binary combination space, we can derive an expression for the membership function {a mathematical formula} Μ Θ (Y → ) of the compound concept {a mathematical formula} Θ = ⋀ i=1k±Li, {a mathematical formula}k ≤ n as a weighted sum of the membership functions for individual domains {a mathematical formula} Μ ±Li(Yi).</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">In a space {a mathematical formula}Rn with the Euclidean distance metric, convexity of a set S is defined by the property that {a mathematical formula} ∀ x,y ∈ S, every point on the line segment connecting x and y is also in S. A detailed discussion is given [19] citing experimental evidence for the fact that concepts as used by humans tend to be convex, and that the use of convex concepts requires less cognitive load.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">We give a definition of convexity for the binary combination spaces {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">For {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ {0,1}n, {a mathematical formula}Z(S) ⊆ {1, … ,n} such that {a mathematical formula}Z(S)={i: ∀ x → ∈ S,xi=0} (the zeros of S)</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">For {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ {0,1}n, {a mathematical formula}O(S) ⊆ {1, … ,n} such that {a mathematical formula}O(S)={i: ∀ x → ∈ S,xi=1} (the ones of S)</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Let{a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,H Λ → , Δ >where P is convex with respect to{a mathematical formula}H Λ → .</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">Furthermore, let{a mathematical formula} Θ ′ =<P,H Λ ′ → , Δ >such that:{a mathematical formula}Then{a mathematical formula} Μ Θ (X → )= Μ Θ ′ (X → )Since P is convex we have that:{a mathematical formula} Therefore,{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">So with respect to membership in Θ in the binary space, the weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ ′ produces the same results as the weight vector Λ .</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">Let{a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,H Λ → , Δ >with{a mathematical formula} Δ =U(0, Λ T), where{a mathematical formula} Λ T= ∑ i=1n Λ i, and{a mathematical formula} Θ ′ =<P,H Λ ′ → , Δ ′ >such that:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Λ T ′ = ∑ i=1n Λ i ′ and{a mathematical formula} Δ ′ =U(0, Λ T ′ )= Λ T Λ T ′ Δ .</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">Let {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P1,d1, Δ 1> and {a mathematical formula} Φ =<P2,d2, Δ 2> be two compound concepts consisting of a conjunction of attribute labels from individual conceptual spaces {a mathematical formula} Ω i.</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">As in section 4.2 we define the following two binary variables:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">Hence {a mathematical formula}X → naturally generates {a mathematical formula}Z → =(Z1,Z2) ∈ {0,1}2.</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">We now define the conjunction of compound concepts as the triple {a mathematical formula} Θ ∧ Φ =({(1,1)},d, Δ ) where d is a distance metric on {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">In this case we can define a binary random variable C such that:{a mathematical formula} We also define the membership function for {a mathematical formula} Θ ∧ Φ as follows:{a mathematical formula} So that {a mathematical formula} Μ Θ ∧ Φ (Z → )=P(C=1|Z → ).</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">Now by applying the theorem of total probability we have that:{a mathematical formula} Then by a second application of the theorem of total probability we have that:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">the attribute set for the conjunctive concept is a union of the attribute sets for the constituent concepts, modelling another aspect of Hampton's results.</a>
<a href="#57" id="57">Concept – concept combinationSuppose one concept, {a mathematical formula}SUCCESS, is defined as a conjunction of labels {a mathematical formula}L1= ‘ rich ’ , {a mathematical formula}L2= ‘ healthy ’ , and suppose {a mathematical formula}HAPPY is defined as a conjunction of labels {a mathematical formula}L2= ‘ healthy ’ and {a mathematical formula}L3= ‘ busy ’ .</a>
<a href="#58" id="58">Furthermore, suppose {a mathematical formula}SUCCESS is formed in the binary space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2 with prototype set {a mathematical formula}Ps={(1,1)}, weighting {a mathematical formula} Λ s → =(0.75,0.25) and {a mathematical formula} Δ s=U(0,1), i.e.</a>
<a href="#59" id="59">{a mathematical formula}SUCCESS=<{(1,1)},H(0.75,0.25),U(0,1)> and similarly suppose {a mathematical formula}HAPPY=<{(1,1)},H(0.5,0.5),U(0,1)>.</a>
<a href="#60" id="60">Within our model, a state s is considered to be a particular point {a mathematical formula}X → in the binary combination space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n and {a mathematical formula} Π (X → ):= Μ Θ (X → ).</a>
<a href="#61" id="61">To compute the necessity of a dimension i to a concept {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,H Λ → , Δ >, where {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ {0,1}n, we consider the necessity of set {a mathematical formula}Si={X → :Xi=pi}, i.e.</a>
<a href="#62" id="62">the set of all points that have equal value to the prototype on dimension i.</a>
<a href="#63" id="63">{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}N Θ Ε is the neighbourhood of Θ as defined in section 3.</a>
<a href="#64" id="64">It may be the case that P contains both points with value 0 on dimension i and points with value 1 on dimension i.</a>
<a href="#65" id="65">In this case we say that {a mathematical formula}Si= ∅ , since {a mathematical formula}Si must satisfy {a mathematical formula}Si={X → :Xi=0 ∧ Xi=1}.</a>
<a href="#66" id="66">Necessity of a dimensionGiven {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,H Λ → , Δ >, the necessity of a dimension i to Θ is defined as the necessity of the set {a mathematical formula}Si={X → :Xi=pi}, where {a mathematical formula}pi is the ith dimension of {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n, by {a mathematical formula}N(Si)= Δ ({ Ε :N Θ Ε ⊆ Si}).</a>
<a href="#67" id="67">For{a mathematical formula} Α =<P,H Λ → , Δ >,{a mathematical formula}N(Si)=1 − Δ ( Λ i).</a>
<a href="#68" id="68">{a mathematical formula}N(Si)=P(N Α Ε ⊆ Si)=P( Ε < Λ i)=1 − Δ ( Λ i).</a>
<a href="#69" id="69">We have introduced the concept of the necessity of a dimension in order to account for some of the non-compositional aspects of conjunctive combinations of concepts.</a>
<a href="#70" id="70">To examine the necessity of a dimension in a conjunction of two compound concepts, we relate the distribution of the threshold Ε in the higher level binary space to the neighbourhood in the first level binary space.</a>
<a href="#71" id="71">Suppose that two concepts Θ and Φ are combined in the second level space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2, with weight vector {a mathematical formula}w → =(w1,w2) where {a mathematical formula}w1 is associated with Θ and {a mathematical formula}w2 with Φ .</a>
<a href="#72" id="72">Suppose {a mathematical formula}w2 ≤ w1.</a>
<a href="#73" id="73">Now, if the threshold Ε in the second level space is less than {a mathematical formula}w2, then an element {a mathematical formula}X → of the first level binary space must belong to the neighbourhoods of both concepts Θ and Φ , i.e.</a>

<a href="#75" id="75">When {a mathematical formula}w2 ≤ Ε ≤ w1, the points within Ε in the second level space are {a mathematical formula}{(1,1),(1,0)}, so {a mathematical formula}X → must belong to {a mathematical formula}N Θ Ε Θ , but does not have to belong to {a mathematical formula}N Φ Ε Φ .</a>
<a href="#76" id="76">When {a mathematical formula}w1 ≤ Ε ≤ wT, where {a mathematical formula}wT=w1+w2, {a mathematical formula}X → may belong to either neighbourhood, i.e.</a>
