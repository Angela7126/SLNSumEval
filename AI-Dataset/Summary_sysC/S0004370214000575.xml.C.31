<a href="#0" id="0">The optimal strategy for the fully cooperative case may dictate that some of the agents should not engage in search at all.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, consider the case of k fully cooperative agents where each agent may explore only a single opportunity (i.e., {a mathematical formula}n=1).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this case, the individual (stand-alone) optimal strategy is to explore one opportunity if {a mathematical formula}c<0.5 (since values are drawn from the uniform distribution).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Each agent's expected utility is thus {a mathematical formula}0.5 − c and the overall expected utility is {a mathematical formula}k ⋅ (0.5 − c).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In joint search, where {a mathematical formula}k ′ agents explore their opportunity ({a mathematical formula}1 ≤ k ′ ≤ k), the search cost is {a mathematical formula}k ′ ⋅ c and the expected utility is the maximum of a {a mathematical formula}k ′ -size sample taken from a uniform distribution, which equals {a mathematical formula}k ′ /(k ′ +1) (see [71]).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The expected overall net utility is thus {a mathematical formula}k ⋅ (k ′ k ′ +1) − k ′ ⋅ c which is maximized for different {a mathematical formula}k ′ values, depending on the value of c. In this example, if initially there are {a mathematical formula}k=5 agents then indeed for a cost of {a mathematical formula}c=0.1 it is optimal to have all agents search, however for a cost of {a mathematical formula}c=0.3 it is optimal that only two agents search.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The analysis of the self-interested case follows the equilibrium concept.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Specifically, since findings of agents are a priori uncertain, we use Bayesian Nash equilibria.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{sup:8} A solution in this case is a set of search strategies, where each agent's strategy maximizes its own individual expected utility given the search strategies used by the other agents.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The set of strategies available for each agent potentially includes engaging in search to some extent or completely avoiding search.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since it is possible that in the end none of the agents will actually engage in the search, in equilibrium, we define the agents' utilities for such cases as {a mathematical formula}v0.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If all agents are characterized by a common probability distribution of values, i.e., {a mathematical formula}f1(x)=f2(x)=...=fk(x)=f(x), then the problem can be mapped to Morgan's optimal sequential sampling problem [44] (even if the search costs of the different agents vary).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this problem, a single agent can explore one or more opportunities in any period, where the cost of exploring {a mathematical formula}k ′ opportunities is given by some monotonically increasing function {a mathematical formula}C(k ′ ).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The best value that has been obtained so far along all agents' search, v, substantially influences the optimal number of agents that will engage in search in the coming search periods.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The number of agents in {a mathematical formula}Kj ′ (v) decreases as v increases, because the expected improvement due to further search decreases, for the increased v value, whereas the cost of such further search does not change.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This makes any additional parallel search efforts less beneficial and consequently the optimal number of agents that need to engage in search decreases.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As for the expected utility, this increases as v increases, as a better “ fallback ” is enabled.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">If v is initially low, its increase results in a minor increase in the expected utility because the chance that despite all the searches performed by the agents no better value will be obtained is insignificant.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Similarly, when v is initially high, the optimal strategy is to have none of the agents search hence any increase in v results in an identical increase in the individual expected utility.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">From the individual agent's point of view, when being self-interested, disclosing a “ good ” value that was obtained along the search is not beneficial, as this will likely discourage the other agents from resuming their search.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Therefore, the exchange of information in this case is mandatory and does not depend on the agents' desire, due to the justifications given in Section 2.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">In this case, as we prove in the following paragraphs, the agent's strategy needs to take into consideration not only the best value obtained so far, as in the “ no communication ” case, but also the remaining number of potential search periods.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's strategy can thus be represented as the mapping {a mathematical formula}S(v,j) → pij(v), where {a mathematical formula}pij(v) is the probability that {a mathematical formula}Ai will choose to explore an additional opportunity when the number of remaining allowed searches is j and the best value obtained so far by all agents is v. We use {a mathematical formula}EBij(v) to denote the expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai if it follows the optimal search strategy, given the strategies used by the other agents, with j search opportunities remaining, and the best value obtained through all the agents' searches so far is v.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Finally, we get to the use of continuous communication as a means of improving a joint search.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">There are many examples of individual and overall performance improvement due to the use of communication throughout the search process when the agents are self-interested.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">For example, consider a two-agent case with a search horizon of {a mathematical formula}n=2, a search cost of {a mathematical formula}c=0.01 and a discrete distribution of values, applicable to both agents' searches, where the value obtained is 1 with a probability of 0.5 and otherwise 0.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">When communication is continuous, the totally mixed equilibrium in this case results in an individual expected utility of 0.925.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">If communication is prohibited throughout the process, the agents' individual expected utility, according to the totally mixed equilibrium, is 0.922.</a>
