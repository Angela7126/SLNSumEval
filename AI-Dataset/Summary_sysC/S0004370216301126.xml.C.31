<a href="#0" id="0">Proof</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By Theorem 1, any sequence of IR deals must converge to an efficient state, independently from the specific payment scheme in use.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As we are using the Knaster payment scheme, any state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) reached during negotiation will satisfy {a mathematical formula} Π (i)=exi(A) − Ex(A)/n for each agent i.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence, we are bound to converge to a state {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ) with an efficient allocation {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ where {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (i)=exi(A ⁎ ) − Ex(A ⁎ )/n.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is exactly the kind of outcome we would have obtained had we used the Knaster procedure, which we have seen to always be proportional (see Section 3.1).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the previous section we have seen that convergence to an efficient and proportional state can always be guaranteed by our scheme.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">But how many deals do we require to reach a social optimum?</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First, observe that by Lemma 3, it is always possible to reach the optimum using (at most) one deal, i.e., 1 is a (tight) upper bound on the shortest path.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Much more interesting in practice, however, is the longest path, i.e., the longest sequence of IR deals that agents may end up agreeing on before convergence.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For convergence to an efficient allocation by means of IR deals, {a mathematical formula}nm − 1, with n being the number of agents and m being the number of goods, is known to be a (tight) upper bound on the longest path, i.e., there exist profiles of valuation functions and initial allocations such that it is possible to visit all allocations before convergence [29].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Inspection of the proof of that result shows that it does not depend on the payment scheme used.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Hence, {a mathematical formula}nm − 1 is also an upper bound on the number of deals for scenarios covered by Theorem 4 — at least if we do not put restrictions on the nature of our agents' valuation functions.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Proof</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Take a scenario where the agents have the valuation functions used in the proof of Lemma 6, except that {a mathematical formula}vn(G) is set to such a high value that the only way of achieving a proportional state is to give all goods to agent n (because no payments the other agents would be prepared to make could be large enough to give utility {a mathematical formula}vn(G)/n to agent n).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Then all allocations have distinct social welfare, i.e., we can construct a sequence of deals visiting all of them, and proportionality would only get achieved at the very end of the sequence.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Proof</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We first show that the following invariant will be true for every state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) and every agent i, provided that agents only negotiate IR deals using the GUPF:{a mathematical formula} Our proof proceeds by induction over the number of deals negotiated.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">As we assume that initial equitability payments have been made, claim (2) will certainly be true for the initial state {a mathematical formula}(A0, Π 0).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Now let {a mathematical formula} Δ =(A,A ′ ) and assume (2) holds for A and the associated payment balance Π .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We obtain the payment balance {a mathematical formula} Π ′ associated with {a mathematical formula}A ′ by adding the appropriate GUPF payments to Π :{a mathematical formula} This proves our claim (2).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Now, Theorem 1 shows that negotiation via IR deals (whichever payment function is used) must eventually terminate and that the final allocation will be efficient.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Let {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ be that final allocation, and let {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ be the associated payment balance.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Equation (2) also applies to the state {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">But as we have already seen in Section 4.1, the efficiency of {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ together with Equation (2) applied to {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ) implies that {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ) must be an EEF state.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Proof</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Recall from the proof of Theorem 8 that the use of the GUPF together with initial equitability payments ensures that we get a payment balance satisfying {a mathematical formula} Π (i)=vi(A) − sw(A)/n for every state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) reached during negotiation and every agent {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Proof</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Suppose the agents have the valuation functions defined in the proof of Lemma 6 and initially allocate all goods to agent 1.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Then agents 1 and 2 can go through all {a mathematical formula}2m allocations that divide all goods between the two of them and end up in the allocation where agent 2 owns all items (that is, there are {a mathematical formula}2m − 1 IR deals between them).</a>
