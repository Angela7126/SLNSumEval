<a href="#0" id="0">We denote by {a mathematical formula}Ai ⊆ Rm the set of possible types for buyer i.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}Ai is thus the projection of {a mathematical formula}A over the dimensions relevant to buyer i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each vendor has a fixed cost {a mathematical formula}cj for producing and/or distributing one unit of its product, which is common knowledge among vendors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Buyer utility is quasi-linear in price: the utility of {a mathematical formula}i ∈ Sj is {a mathematical formula}ui(P,S)=vij − pj(|Sj|).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then we obtain the partition {a mathematical formula}S=({a,b},{c}).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The partition {a mathematical formula}S ′ is an SBP, as no buyer has an incentive to deviate from it.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that {a mathematical formula}S ′ is not the only SBP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The partition {a mathematical formula}S ″ where all buyers go with vendor 2 is also stable.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus {a mathematical formula}S ′ =S(P,V).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A game{a mathematical formula}G= 〈 V,C 〉 in the full information model is given by a buyer type matrix {a mathematical formula}V=(vi,j) and vendors costs {a mathematical formula}C=(cj).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Suppose that {a mathematical formula}c1=c2=0, and consider the example given in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Since by our assumption, under {a mathematical formula}P,V buyers partition according to the SBP {a mathematical formula}S ′ (i.e., all buyers choose vendor 1), the utility of the vendors is {a mathematical formula}U1=3 ⋅ p1(3)=3;U2=0.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For example, vendor 2 can change her discount schedule to {a mathematical formula}p2 ′ =(1,1,0), which would result in the SBP {a mathematical formula}S(P ′ ,V)=({a,b},{c}) with {a mathematical formula}U2 ′ =1.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Vendor 1 can also post a better schedule, by raising his prices to, say, {a mathematical formula}p1 ′ =(8,6,2).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In the full information model, there is always a fixed price{a mathematical formula}pjthat is a best response for vendor j to any strategy profile{a mathematical formula}P − jof the other vendors.If the vendors have full information, then they know exactly which buyer partitions will form given any profile of discounts P. Suppose that vendor j expects to have t buyers under some nontrivial schedule {a mathematical formula}pj.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">That is, {a mathematical formula}|Sj|=t, where {a mathematical formula}S=S((p − j,pj),V).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Then j can post a fixed price {a mathematical formula}pj=pj(t) and induce identical buyer behavior S.Let {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ =(p − j,pj).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">To see why S is still an SBP, assume toward a contradiction that some buyer i has a deviation from {a mathematical formula}Sk to {a mathematical formula}Sk ′ under prices {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">First, {a mathematical formula}pk(|Sk|)=pk ⁎ (|Sk|).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">First consider the case of a single vendor: suppose a monopolist is faced with distribution {a mathematical formula}D over buyer types.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">However, consider a discount schedule with a base price {a mathematical formula}p(1)=3, and a discounted price {a mathematical formula}p(2)=2.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Suppose vendors other than j post discount schedules {a mathematical formula}p − j.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The best response of j is:{a mathematical formula} Our main result in the Bayesian model is that, assuming buyer types are independent and drawn from the same distribution, a vendor cannot benefit by using a discount schedule instead of a fixed price unless other vendors also use schedules.</a>

<a href="#24" id="24">An indifferent buyer (with {a mathematical formula}v=p) always chooses to buy a product from vendor 1 over abstaining from purchase.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">The vendor can attract k buyers at price p iff there are k buyers for which {a mathematical formula}vi,1 ≥ p.</a>

<a href="#27" id="27">Buyer a prefers vendor 1: {a mathematical formula}va1=10+x, where {a mathematical formula}x ∼ U(0,1]; and {a mathematical formula}va2=10.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Buyer b prefers vendor 2: {a mathematical formula}vb1=10; and {a mathematical formula}vb2=10+y, where {a mathematical formula}y ∼ U(0,1].</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Consider the fixed price profile {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ =(1,1).</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">We argue that if discounts are not allowed, then {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is an equilibrium, i.e., that no vendor can earn more than 1 by posting a fixed price.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Indeed, suppose that vendor 1 announces some price {a mathematical formula}q>1, then it keeps buyer a w.p.</a>

<a href="#33" id="33">Similarly, if {a mathematical formula}q<1, then the vendor keeps buyer a for sure, and gains buyer b w.p.</a>

<a href="#35" id="35">Nevertheless, if vendor 1 deviates to the non-trivial discount schedule {a mathematical formula}q1 ′ =(1,34), then it can derive higher expected revenue.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">{a mathematical formula}14, buyer b has a preference of less than {a mathematical formula}14 for vendor 2 (i.e., {a mathematical formula}y<14), and will select vendor 1 in the unique SBP {a mathematical formula}S((q1 ′ ,p2),V).</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">The fixed profile {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1) remains a fixed price equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Moreover, since the best response of vendor 1 to price 1 is {a mathematical formula}q1=(1,34) regardless of its type, it remains a best response in the new game.</a>

<a href="#40" id="40">It is not hard to verify that the best response of every vendor j to the fixed price {a mathematical formula}p − j=1 is {a mathematical formula}pj=1, even if schedules are allowed (i.e., {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1) is an equilibrium, see Section 6.1).</a>

<a href="#43" id="43">Note that when {a mathematical formula} Ε =1, the average value of all buyers for every j is 1.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">We can think of event j as representing the level of detail in a product review: when {a mathematical formula}j=n, no buyer knows anything about the product, so all buyers assign it an expected value of 1.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Note that this can be achieved with the schedule {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ (j)=vj, thus the optimal schedule {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ extracts from any buyer her full expected value:{a mathematical formula} which approaches n as {a mathematical formula} Ε → 0.Suppose instead that the vendor uses a fixed price.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Once vendors select strategies (prices) P, suppose that the realized buyer types are given by V. This results in the buyer partition {a mathematical formula}S=S(P,V).</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">the optimal schedule {a mathematical formula}pj ′ can be taken to be a fixed price (by Proposition 1).</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">Specifically, let P be a strategy (pricing) profile, where vendor j uses {a mathematical formula}pj.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">First, we say that the buyer types {a mathematical formula}A are symmetric if {a mathematical formula}Ai=Ai ′ for all {a mathematical formula}i,i ′ ∈ N; in other words, all buyers have identical sets of possible preferences.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">Suppose first that j's maximum regret is realized by a buyer type profile in which its best response is to ask a lower price than its price {a mathematical formula}pj in P, which by definition must attract more buyers than {a mathematical formula}pj.</a>

<a href="#53" id="53">Let {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ =Vi.</a>

<a href="#55" id="55">As {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ =Vi, in the partition {a mathematical formula}T ′ all buyers select j, and thus {a mathematical formula}|Tj ′ |=n ≥ |Sj ′ |.Likewise, under prices P, buyer i prefers some other vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ over j, i.e.</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">{a mathematical formula}vij ′ − pj ′ ≥ vij − pj.</a>
<a href="#57" id="57">In this case, there must be a buyer {a mathematical formula}i ∈ Sj ′ of type {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ =Vi.</a>

<a href="#63" id="63">In particular, {a mathematical formula}|Tj| ∈ {0,n}.If {a mathematical formula}|Tj|=0, then {a mathematical formula}|Sj|=0 as well, since at price {a mathematical formula}pj=qj(n) vendor j does not attract any buyer of type {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#64" id="64">If {a mathematical formula}|Tj|=n, then the vendor attracts all buyers of type {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ at price {a mathematical formula}pj and thus {a mathematical formula}|Sj|=n=|Tj|, and{a mathematical formula} Note that in either case {a mathematical formula}|Tj|(qj(|Tj|) − cj)=|Sj|(pj − cj).</a>
<a href="#65" id="65">The possible valuations (types spaces) for the buyers are {a mathematical formula}A1=[6,12];A2=A3=[0,6], and {a mathematical formula}A=A1×A2×A3.We first show that the optimal fixed price is {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ =4, and that {a mathematical formula}MaxReg(4)=8.</a>
