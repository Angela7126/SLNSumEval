<a href="#0" id="0">Consider the social network {a mathematical formula}S of Example 1 and the GAP {a mathematical formula} Π hiv of Example 3.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let Π be the GAP modeling both the SN and the diffusion model, i.e., {a mathematical formula} Π = Π S ∪ Π hiv.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, {a mathematical formula}T Π reaches a least fixed point at the third iteration, as shown in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Notice that the least fixed point of Π and {a mathematical formula}S ⊕ p(v) (or {a mathematical formula}S ⊖ p(v)) takes into account the initial assignment of p to the vertices of {a mathematical formula}S. Thus, DC depends also on the initial assignment of p in {a mathematical formula}S. For instance, consider two SNs that are identical except that in the first one every vertex has property p, while in the second one no vertex has property p. In the first SN, {a mathematical formula}dc(v)=0 for every vertex v, because whether p is given to v or not has no impact, since everyone already has p. In contrast, in the second SN, {a mathematical formula}dc(v) reflects how much overall spread of p we achieve in the SN by assigning p to v.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In fact, it is easy to see from the rules above that a vertex cannot transmit {a mathematical formula}hiv if it does not have {a mathematical formula}sp relations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The hypergraph does not depend on which vertices have property p in the original SN, but depends only on Π and the structure of {a mathematical formula}S in terms of edges and vertex properties other than p. Therefore, given a GAP Π and an SN{a mathematical formula}S, the diffusion hypergraph has to be computed only once and can be used with different assignments of a property p to the vertices of{a mathematical formula}S. This allows us to save time in computing diffusion centrality which requires computing the least fixed point for different initial assignments of p. However, if the SN changes, the diffusion hypergraph needs to be recomputed.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then {a mathematical formula}S ′ is coarsened into a smaller social network {a mathematical formula}SC (line 2), and the exact set {a mathematical formula}TC of top-k vertices over {a mathematical formula}SC is computed (line 3) by running HyperDC to find the diffusion centrality of all vertices in {a mathematical formula}S ′ and choosing the top-k. At this point the set {a mathematical formula}TC is extended with its neighbors in {a mathematical formula}SC at a distance no greater than {a mathematical formula}dC, in order to limit the bias of the vertices in {a mathematical formula}TC in the following computation (line 4).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The Jackson – Yariv model is a diffusion model stating that a vertex will receive (adopt) a property p according to the cumulative effect of its neighbors and the ratio of the benefit to the cost of the vertex for adopting p. Suppose that {a mathematical formula}vi is an agent having a default behavior that can be changed in the new behavior p, and that {a mathematical formula}vi has specific cost {a mathematical formula}ci and benefit {a mathematical formula}bi for adopting the behavior p. Then, the Jackson – Yariv model can be expressed by the rule (see [51]):{a mathematical formula} where (1){a mathematical formula}r( ∑ jEj) is a function describing how the number of neighbors of {a mathematical formula}vi affects the benefits to {a mathematical formula}vi for adopting behavior p, (2){a mathematical formula} ∑ jwj ∑ jEj is the fraction of the neighbors of {a mathematical formula}vi having property p, and (3){a mathematical formula}dpJY is a constant representing the probability that the vertex v will adopt the property p. In our experiments we set {a mathematical formula}r( ∑ jEj) to be a logarithmic function normalized by the logarithm of the maximum in-degree {a mathematical formula}dmaxin of the network, and having values within the interval {a mathematical formula}[0.1,2], i.e., {a mathematical formula}r( ∑ jEj)=1.9×ln ⁡ ( ∑ jEj)ln ⁡ (dmaxin)+0.1.</a>
