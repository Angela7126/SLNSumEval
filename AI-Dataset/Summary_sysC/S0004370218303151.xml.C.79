<a href="#0" id="0">Consistent generation rules are of the form {a mathematical formula}(C ′ ,C), when availability of coalition C depends only on existence of a single overlapping coalition {a mathematical formula}C ′ with {a mathematical formula}C ′ ∩ C ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While the results apply in general, they are strongest when {a mathematical formula}m ∈ poly(n) (e.g., for matching or when all coalitions that can form have constant size), since in this case we obtain a clear dichotomy of polynomial in n vs. exponential in n. Moreover, if {a mathematical formula}m ∈ poly(n), then many involved problems in constructing improvement steps (finding a local blocking coalition, or the one with maximum benefit) can be solved trivially in time {a mathematical formula}poly(n).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Similar to our approach for social coalition formation games above, we consider a set {a mathematical formula}H of formation graphs that determines the minimum graph structures that are required among a coalition to be a candidate for deviation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given an instance of socially stable matching consisting of a graph {a mathematical formula}GM=(VM,EM) of potential matching edges, social link set {a mathematical formula}L ⊆ EM, and edge benefits b, we construct an equivalent coalition formation game with consistent constraints as follows.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given an instance of locally stable matching consisting of a graph {a mathematical formula}GM=(VM,EM) of potential matching edges, social link set L, and edge benefits b, we construct an equivalent coalition formation game with consistent constraints as follows.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given an instance of considerate stable matching consisting of a graph {a mathematical formula}GM=(VM,EM) of potential matching edges, social link set L, and edge benefits b, we construct an equivalent coalition formation game with consistent constraints as follows.</a>
