<a href="#10" id="10">Using the pairwise synergy function, we now define the performance of a team of agents: The synergy{a mathematical formula}S(A) of a set of agents {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ A in a weighted synergy graph is the average of the pairwise synergy of its components, i.e., {a mathematical formula}1(|A|2) ⋅ ∑ {ai,aj} ∈ AS2(ai,aj).</a>
