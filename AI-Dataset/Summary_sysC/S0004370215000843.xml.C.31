<a href="#0" id="0">In order to robustly perform tasks based on abstract instructions, robots need sophisticated knowledge processing methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These methods have to supply the difference between the (often shallow and symbolic) information in the instructions and the (detailed, grounded and often real-valued) information needed for execution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For filling these information gaps, a robot first has to identify them in the instructions, reason about suitable information sources, and combine pieces of information from different sources and of different structure into a coherent knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To this end we propose the KnowRob knowledge processing system for robots.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this article, we discuss why the requirements of a robot knowledge processing system differ from what is commonly investigated in AI research, and propose to re-consider a KR system as a semantically annotated view on information and algorithms that are often already available as part of the robot's control system.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We then introduce representational structures and a common vocabulary for representing knowledge about robot actions, events, objects, environments, and the robot's hardware as well as inference procedures that operate on this common representation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The KnowRob system has been released as open-source software and is being used on several robots performing complex object manipulation tasks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We evaluate it through prototypical queries that demonstrate the expressive power and its impact on the robot's performance.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is the approach taken by the KnowRob knowledge processing system that we present in this article.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It consists of a (rather shallow) symbolic knowledge base that provides semantic representations of the robot's data structures that primarily serves as integration layer for various inference algorithms.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The representation can be shallow compared to expressive AI reasoning methods since few inferences are done at this level.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, it does not have to model the appearance of objects if the visibility reasoning algorithm can read it from a linked 3D model.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">And it does not have to model physical laws if an algorithm for computing object stability can read its physical properties from a CAD model and parameterize a simulator with them.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The role of a KR system therefore shifts from a world model that has to be consistent and complete towards a semantic integration layer.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The correctness of inferences is then determined by the correctness of the algorithms rather than a complete and correct axiomatization that would anyway be difficult to guarantee if information is read from noisy sensors.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">One query to the knowledge base may require the use of different inference methods and different information sources.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For example, a robot may ask if its gripper has been inside a container during a pick-up task in order to verify that a pick-up action has been attempted.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Such a query requires temporal reasoning about events during the pick-up action, ontological reasoning to determine which objects are containers and three-dimensional spatial reasoning to determine the “ inside ” relation.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">These reasoners need access to the robot's task logs, to proprioceptive information about the gripper movements, to the environment model and to general knowledge about types of objects.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We therefore decided to use a common underlying representation for all these kinds of information and to have an ensemble of expert reasoners operate on this shared knowledge.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This approach is similar to other ensemble-of-experts architectures such as the IBM Watson system [11] that has demonstrated impressive performance on real-world question answering not by using a single reasoning method, but a collection of several specialized ones.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">In contrast, many classical AI reasoning methods focus on either temporal or qualitative spatial or ontological reasoning, while not supporting the other ones.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">As long as all hardware components are available, the robot could try to launch software components that provide missing capabilities.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Missing software components, e.g.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">detailed instructions for sub-tasks, environment maps or object models can also be downloaded from web-based knowledge bases such as RoboEarth [51].</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">For formulating queries to this system and for integrating the results with the existing knowledge base, it is important to have all information in the same language.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The representation language used in RoboEarth [45] is a subset of the representations described in this paper, so information described in that language can simply be loaded into KnowRob.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The following query downloads an environment map and an object model; it is formulated using the part-of relation between the building, floor and room (Section 4.2).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">After download, the system automatically downloads models for all object classes whose instances appear in the map if they are not available yet.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">To ground the abstract object descriptions in an instruction into actual objects in the environment, the robot needs to add actions for searching for these objects and for retrieving them from their storage locations.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">If the objects' locations are known, they can simply be looked up in the environment map (Section 4.2), but often this is not the case.</a>
