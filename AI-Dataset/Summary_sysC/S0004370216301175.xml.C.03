<a href="#1" id="1">Intuitively, each set B ∈ {a mathematical formula}B represents a set of alternatives (or choice experiment) that can be conceivably posed to the decision maker.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider the set {a mathematical formula}B={{box1},{box2},{box3},{box1,box2},{box1,box3},{box2,box3},{box1,box2,box3}}.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">Following our running example we can define the abstract decision framework {a mathematical formula} 〈 Xr,Cr,>Cr,Kr, Γ r 〉 , with the set of alternatives {a mathematical formula}Xr={box1,box2,box3}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let {a mathematical formula} Σ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Σ 2 be two argumental structures in W, then{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}dlits( Σ ) ⊆ C is the set of distinguished literals that are contained in arguments of an argumental structure Σ .</a>

<a href="#8" id="8">The following definition states when a decision rule will be applicable with respect to a particular scenario which will be represented by the epistemic component {a mathematical formula}K.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then, to determine which alternatives will be selected from a choice experiment B it is necessary to consider all the decision rules from Γ that are applicable with respect to the justified conclusions that can be inferred from the active arguments of {a mathematical formula}K. The set of acceptable alternatives can be defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Set of acceptable alternativesLet {a mathematical formula}B ⊆ X be a set of alternatives posed to the agent and {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,C,>C,K, Γ 〉 be the agent's decision framework.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Then, the set of acceptable alternatives {a mathematical formula} Ω B of the agent will be defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">3 we propose an algorithm for selecting acceptable alternatives from B given a decision framework {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,C,>C,K, Γ 〉 .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">That is because the algorithm assigns to each set of alternatives {a mathematical formula}B ∈ B a non-empty set that represents the alternatives that the decision maker might choose when presented with the alternatives in B.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">To introduce next result, Algorithm 1 will be considered as the function {a mathematical formula} Μ ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) with two arguments: an abstract decision framework and a set of alternatives.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">If the proposed decision framework would be used together with the DAF mentioned above to filter alternatives in X, the output of this DAF, let us call it {a mathematical formula}Xf, should be used instead of X in Definition 3.</a>
