<a href="#0" id="0">the definition of the core combinatorial structure of the optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Informally, this is the part of the optimization model that can be designed by a domain expert in a traditional fashion.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Defining the combinatorial structure requires one to identify the input and output of the Empirical Model, i.e.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">to define which part of the final model should be extracted from data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This decision affects the Machine Learning techniques that can be used to extract the Empirical Model.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For our example problems, we have already provided a first definition of the core combinatorial structure in the two base models from Section 3.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In both cases, the input of the Empirical Model is given by the mapping variables.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The EM output for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is given by the efficiency of each core: this implies that some kind of regression technique must be used to obtain the Empirical Model.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The output for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax is a vector of binary variables ({a mathematical formula}effk=1 iff core k has “ high ” efficiency), hence in this case the Empirical Model is a classifier.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the remainder of this section we will present models for the core combinatorial structure of the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal and the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax, using a variety of optimization techniques (LS, MINLP, CP, and SMT).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We refer to each model with the notation {a mathematical formula}Tp(h), where T identifies the solution technique, and p the problem type (bal for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal and max for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Core model for Local Search The Local Search model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is identical to the base model presented in Section 3, and reported here for convenience:</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Core model for MINLP A MINLP model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal can be obtained from the base model by linearizing the objective function:</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{a mathematical formula} We did not design a MINLP model for our second example problem, because we have not defined a technique for encoding in MINLP a Decision Tree, i.e.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">the Empirical Model that we employ for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax (see Section 7).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The training set for the example problems For our dispatching problems, we learn a different Machine Learning model for each core.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Empirical models for the{a mathematical formula}WDPbal We used Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the Empirical Model of the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal, for several reasons.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Empirical models for the{a mathematical formula}WDPmax For the second dispatching problem, we can use a classifier as an Empirical Model, trained to distinguish low- and high-efficiency cores.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Specifically, our Empirical Model consists of a Decision Tree (DT) for each core.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Results for the{a mathematical formula}WDPbal We obtained a LS approach based on the ACPI model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal by inserting the {a mathematical formula}hACPI(x) function into the core Local Search model from Section 6.</a>
