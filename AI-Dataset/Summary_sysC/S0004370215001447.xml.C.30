<a href="#0" id="0">Taking these considerations into account, the Fifth ASP Competition was based on the System track of the 2013 edition,{sup:2} reusing the available benchmarks but also adding novel problem encodings.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In view of the objective of comparing participant systems in a uniform setting, this edition of the ASP Competition did not include a Model&Solve track, but took place in the spirit of the former System track: it was open to any general-purpose solving system, provided it was able to process ASP-Core-2 programs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The general input – output format followed the 2013 edition, so that previous System track submissions should (in principle) be able to participate again.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, the 2013 edition still made exceptions and admitted problem encodings in legacy formats, while the Fifth ASP Competition insisted on ASP-Core-2 compliance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let M be the number of participant systems; then, the score of a solver S for an instance I in a domain P featuring N instances is calculated as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}MS(I) is</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The benchmark domains used in this edition of the ASP Competition largely coincide with the ones from 2013.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As described in Section 3, the benchmarks in the Fifth ASP Competition are categorized into tracks based on the language features utilized by encodings.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Table 1 provides an overview that groups benchmark domains in terms of language features in the ASP-Core-2 encodings from 2013.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">That is, the 2013 encodings for Labyrinth and Stable Marriage belong to the Basic Decision track (#1), and the “ D ” entries in the fourth column indicate that both domains deal with Decision problems.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The Advanced Decision track (#2) includes the sixteen 2013 encodings for the domains in rows from Bottle Filling to Weighted-Sequence Problem.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Among them, the Reachability domain aims at Query answering, as indicated by the “ Q ” in the fourth column.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The next four rows marked with “ O ” provide the domains in the Optimization track (#3).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Finally, the last four rows give the domains in the Unrestricted track (#4), where Abstract Dialectical Frameworks is an Optimization problem and Strategic Companies deals with Query answering.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The second column of Table 1 summarizes the usage of particular language features, among the ones introduced in Section 2, for the encodings from the Fourth ASP Competition in 2013.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In this way, twenty instances were picked per domain in order to assess the participant systems both on the encodings from 2013 as well as their new variants.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In this section, we introduce the participants of the Fifth ASP Competition: 16 systems submitted by three teams.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">It is also worth mentioning that, in order to assess improvements in system implementation, we reran a selection of the systems submitted to the Fourth ASP Competition in 2013.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We start by presenting performance results for the systems introduced in Section 5 on benchmarks consisting of 2013 problem encodings and twenty randomly selected instances per domain.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Finally, Table 6 provides the results for Track #4, containing non-HCF instances of the Decision problems Complex Optimization and Minimal Diagnosis, the Query problem Strategic Companies, and the Optimization problem Abstract Dialectical Frameworks.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Note that wasp-wpm1-only-weak competed only in the latter domain, scored like the Optimization problems in Track #3, and that no instance of Strategic Companies was solved by any system.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Similarly, Table 8 summarizes performance results for the MP category, in which clasp-mt by the Potassco team is followed by lp2sat3+plingeling-mt and lp2mip2-mt by the Aalto team.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The native system clasp-mt participated and achieved first places in all four tracks, lp2sat3+plingeling-mt was more successful than lp2mip2-mt among translation-based systems in Tracks #1 and #2, while lp2mip2-mt became second (behind clasp-mt) in Track #3 dealing with Optimization problems; detailed results for each domain are given in Table 12.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Albeit clasp-mt was disqualified in Abstract Dialectical Frameworks due to incorrect parallel optimization w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">3 plot the score acquisition of systems for Optimization problems (marked with “ O ” in Table 1), where system runs are ordered by the achieved positive scores, and the sum of scores for the number of instances on the x-axis is given on the y-axis.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">In this section, we compare the format of the Fifth ASP Competition with past editions, discussing the differences with respect to several aspects, such as tracks or scoring systems.</a>
