<a href="#0" id="0">The goal of an online transfer learning (OTL) task is to learn some prediction function {a mathematical formula}f(xt) on a target domain in an online fashion from a sequence of examples {a mathematical formula}{(xt,yt)|t=1, … ,T} in some data space {a mathematical formula}X×Y.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Without loss of generality, we assume a linear prediction model is used for the prediction function, i.e., {a mathematical formula}f(xt)=sign(wt ⊤ xt).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The proof of the proposition is given in Appendix A.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By this proposition, we summarize the proposed “ Heterogeneous Online Transfer Learning ” (HetOTL) algorithm in Algorithm 3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First of all, it is clear that the proposed two online transfer learning algorithms are significantly more effective than the other algorithms for most cases.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Second, among all the compared algorithms, we observe that the proposed HomOTL-I and HomOTL-II algorithms always achieve the best performance when C is sufficiently large (e.g.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}C>4), which indicates a large learning rate can efficiently improve the transfer learning efficiency.</a>
