<a href="#0" id="0">Consider the credibility base:{a mathematical formula} This set represents the information introduced above for our running example: the agent K has informed that A is more credible than C ({a mathematical formula}A>C), the agent H has informed that {a mathematical formula}C>B, J has informed that {a mathematical formula}B>A, and X (the editor of the newsletter) has informed that {a mathematical formula}K>J.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each credibility element that can be inferred from a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C will have an argument associated that supports it, and such argument will contain the reliability information for that inference.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This reliability information will be used for comparing arguments supporting contradictory conclusions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An argument is a minimal set of credibility objects as defined next.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">ArgumentLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base, {a mathematical formula}A be a set of agents, and {a mathematical formula}B,C ∈ A where {a mathematical formula}B ≠ C, an argument {a mathematical formula}X for the conclusion {a mathematical formula}B>C from {a mathematical formula}C is a set of credibility objects {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ C, such that {a mathematical formula}B>C ∈ cl(X) and there is no {a mathematical formula}X ′ ⊂ X holding that {a mathematical formula}B>C ∈ cl(X ′ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The set of all arguments that can be built from {a mathematical formula}C will be denoted as {a mathematical formula}ArgsC.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If {a mathematical formula}X is an argument for the conclusion {a mathematical formula}B>C, sometimes we will use the notation {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,B>C 〉 .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">SubargumentLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base and {a mathematical formula}X,Z ∈ ArgsC, then {a mathematical formula}Z is a subargument of {a mathematical formula}X if and only if {a mathematical formula}Z ⊆ X.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let{a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 be an argument that can be built from the credibility base{a mathematical formula}Cand{a mathematical formula}C ⊆ C ′ then{a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 can also be built from{a mathematical formula}C ′ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Consider again the credibility base of our running example introduced in Example 2:{a mathematical formula} There are seven arguments that can be built from {a mathematical formula}C2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">There, each argument is represented as a table of one column with its name and conclusion at the top, and below them, the set of credibility objects used for obtaining the conclusion.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Nevertheless, in the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C2 there is more information that can be used.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If {a mathematical formula}(Y,X) ∈ TAttsC then by Definition 5 there is a subargument {a mathematical formula}Z of {a mathematical formula}X such that {a mathematical formula}Y and {a mathematical formula}Z have contradictory conclusions.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Then, given that any argument is trivially a subargument of itself, by Definition 5 it holds that {a mathematical formula}(Z,Y) ∈ TAttsC.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Recall that given an argument {a mathematical formula}X the set {a mathematical formula}rel(X) represents the reliability of {a mathematical formula}X and contains all the agent identifiers that are sources of the credibility objects in {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For instance, as shown for the arguments from Example 3, {a mathematical formula}rel(A1)={K,J}, {a mathematical formula}rel(A2)={K,H} and {a mathematical formula}rel(A3)={J}.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Consider the credibility base of our running example:{a mathematical formula} In Example 3, we have shown how from {a mathematical formula}C2 it is possible to build the arguments {a mathematical formula}A2,A3, and {a mathematical formula}A1, and Fig.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">An AFRA is expressed as a set of arguments and a set of attacks, where an attack is a pair {a mathematical formula}(A,T) such that {a mathematical formula}A is an argument and {a mathematical formula}T is either an argument or an attack [4].</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">To instantiate an AFRA, we will use arguments and attacks obtained from a credibility base, and then we will analyze which elements are accepted from this framework.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Thus, each credibility base will characterize a particular AFRA which will be called its associated AFRA.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Associated AFRALet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base, the associated AFRA of {a mathematical formula}C is {a mathematical formula}(ArgsC,AttsC) where {a mathematical formula}ArgsC is the set of arguments that can be built from {a mathematical formula}C, and {a mathematical formula}AttsC=TAttsC ∪ RAttsC ∪ IAttsC with {a mathematical formula}TAttsC its set of trust-attacks, {a mathematical formula}RAttsC its set of reliability-attacks and {a mathematical formula}IAttsC its set of indirect-reliability-attacks.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Defeat in associated AFRALet {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC,AttsC 〉 be the associated AFRA of a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, {a mathematical formula} Α , Β ∈ AttsC and {a mathematical formula}X ∈ ArgsC ∪ AttsC:</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Consider the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C7 and its associated AFRA as depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Consider the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C8 introduced in Example 8.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The associated AFRA of this base is characterized by the arguments and attacks that were depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Extension of a credibility baseLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base and E a preferred extension of its associated AFRA {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC,AttsC 〉 .</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">We will say that E is an extension of a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C iff for any argument {a mathematical formula}X ∈ ArgsC if every subargument {a mathematical formula}Z ⊂ X is in E then {a mathematical formula}X is in E.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Justified credibilitiesLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base and E an extension of {a mathematical formula}C, then the set of justified credibilities of E is {a mathematical formula}JE={A>B: 〈 X,A>B 〉 ∈ E}.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Let{a mathematical formula}Cbe a credibility base and E an extension of{a mathematical formula}C, then there is no pair of arguments{a mathematical formula}Xand{a mathematical formula}Yin E, such that{a mathematical formula}Xand{a mathematical formula}Yhave contradictory conclusions.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">If {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ JE, by Definition 14 it holds that there is an argument {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 in E, thus {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 in {a mathematical formula}ArgsC.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">By Definition 2 we have that {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ C and {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ cl(X).</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Then {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ cl(C).</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">If {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ JE then, by Definition 14, there is an argument {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 in E. By Definition 2 it holds that {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ C and {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ cl(X).</a>
