<a href="#0" id="0">As it turns out, repair answer sets do not have higher complexity than ordinary answer sets (more precisely, weak and flp answer sets) if queries in DL-atoms are evaluable in polynomial time; to ensure this, we concentrate on the prominent Description Logic DL-{a mathematical formula}LiteA from the DL-Lite family [21].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that {a mathematical formula}PweakI,O is an ordinary ground positive program without DL-atoms and default-negated literals, which has the least (unique minimal) model if each rule in {a mathematical formula}P is definite (i.e., {a mathematical formula}n=1 in (1)).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is not difficult to verify that I is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}PflpI,O, and hence an flp-answer set of Π ; in fact {a mathematical formula}ASflp( Π )={I}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In (iii), the complexity drops to {a mathematical formula}NP-completeness if the update operator ⋂ ̵ is excluded, as then the flp- and the strong answer sets of such DL-programs are guaranteed to coincide and deciding strong answer set existence is {a mathematical formula}co-{a mathematical formula}NP-complete [36].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A natural question is whether computing repair answer sets via compatible sets {a mathematical formula}I ˆ of Π makes repair answer set checking for {a mathematical formula}I ˆ | Π easier than for arbitrary interpretations I.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In principle, one can exploit Proposition 13 and resort to {a mathematical formula}Td, i.e., compute the classification {a mathematical formula}Clf(Td), and determine nonground support sets of {a mathematical formula}d(X → ) minimal conflict sets [74].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, like for {a mathematical formula}DL-LiteAdeciding weak- or flp-repair answer set existence is {a mathematical formula}NP-hard for DL-programs with simple structure and input-free DL-atoms where deciding answer set existence is tractable [79].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">(Hardness) The {a mathematical formula}NP-hardness is inherited from ordinary normal logic programs, whose repair answer sets coincide with their answer sets; as deciding answer set existence for normal logic programs is {a mathematical formula}NP-hard [61], the result follows.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">(Membership) The overall algorithm of deciding the existence of a weak repair answer set proceeds as follows: we guess an interpretation I, values of DL-atoms and an ABox {a mathematical formula}A ′ and then check whether:</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Similar as in the proof of Theorem 36, the {a mathematical formula} Σ bop-repairs are then of the form {a mathematical formula}A ′ =A ∪ H where {a mathematical formula}H is a hitting set of the {a mathematical formula}Sj, but we must ensure that {a mathematical formula} 〈 T,A ′ 〉 is consistent as {a mathematical formula}H consists of new assertions.We choose a set {a mathematical formula}H − ⊆ ⋃ jSj of at most k negative assertions, which is a partial hitting set, and check that {a mathematical formula} 〈 T,A ∪ H − 〉 is consistent.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">If yes, we remove {a mathematical formula}Sj if it intersects with {a mathematical formula}H − and remove otherwise from {a mathematical formula}Sj each positive assertion Α such that ¬ Α is entailed by {a mathematical formula} 〈 T,A ∪ H − 〉 , and all negative assertions.Then, for every hitting set {a mathematical formula}H+ of {a mathematical formula}Sj ′ , the ABox {a mathematical formula}A ′ =A ∪ H − ∪ H+ is a {a mathematical formula} Σ bop-repair.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">On the other hand, some {a mathematical formula} Σ bop-repair with few negative additions exists only if some choice for {a mathematical formula}H − succeeds.We now show the correctness of the proposed algorithm formally.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">(Completeness of RepAns) Let {a mathematical formula}rep( Σ ,x)I ˆ | Π ( Π ) be the set of all Σ -selected repairs for Π that turn {a mathematical formula}I ˆ | Π into an x-repair answer set.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Towards a contradiction, assume that there exists some {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ rep( Σ ,x)I ˆ | Π ( Π ) which is not an output of the algorithm RepAns.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">As a result the program {a mathematical formula}ProgTclass computes all concept and role inclusions that follow from the TBox as well as all unary and binary conflict sets (whose construction is sound and complete based on the results in [74]).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Thus one of the following must be true: (i) no extension of {a mathematical formula}I| Π with guessed values of replacement atoms is a model of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ ″ , (ii) no model of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ ″ is a compatible set for {a mathematical formula} Π ″ or (iii) there exists {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊂ I| Π , which is a model of {a mathematical formula}PweakI| Π ,O ″ .The case (i) is irrelevant, as {a mathematical formula}I| Π ˆ satisfies all rules of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ due to {a mathematical formula}I ∈ AS( Π ˆ ∪ Π supp ∪ facts(A)) and {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ ″ = Π ˆ .</a>
