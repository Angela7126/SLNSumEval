<a href="#0" id="0">By definition of {a mathematical formula}FST, there are no undec-labelled arguments according to L. Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}FST always returns a set of complete labellings, bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics entails that {a mathematical formula}L ∈ LCO(AF), thus L is a stable labelling.Finally, similarly to the proof of Theorem 3, by Proposition 5 it holds that {a mathematical formula}FST is the canonical local function of stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">that there is a unique minimal labelling in {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI): this is obtained as a by-product of the proof.First we prove that {a mathematical formula}L ′ ↓ Ar is a minimal labelling of {a mathematical formula}FCO(AF,I,LI,RI).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since {a mathematical formula}L ′ is by definition a complete labelling and complete semantics is top-down decomposable (see Theorem 3), it holds that {a mathematical formula}L ′ ↓ I ′ ∈ FCO(AF ′ ↓ I ′ , ∅ , ∅ , ∅ ) and {a mathematical formula}L ′ ↓ Ar ∈ FCO(AF,I,L ′ ↓ I,RI).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, consider an argumentation framework AF, an arbitrary partition {a mathematical formula}{E,D} ∈ FALL(AF) and two labellings {a mathematical formula}LE ∈ LE and {a mathematical formula}LD ∈ LD such that {a mathematical formula}LE ∈ FGR(AF ↓ E,Einp,LD ↓ Einp,ER) and {a mathematical formula}LD ∈ FGR(AF ↓ D,Dinp,LE ↓ Dinp,DR): taking into account that {a mathematical formula}FGR returns a subset of {a mathematical formula}FCO (see Proposition 6), by bottom-up decomposability of complete semantics (see Theorem 3) {a mathematical formula}(LE ∪ LD) is a complete labelling of AF.</a>
