<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we have designed, implemented, and analyzed a framework that allows us to envision the physical effects of robot manipulation actions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We consider envisioning to be a qualitative reasoning method that reasons about actions and their effects based on simulation-based projections.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thereby it allows a robot to infer what could happen when it performs a task in a certain way.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Based on such information, a robot has to understand the nature of the task, that is, it has to reason about how the physical effects of a manipulation action depend on the way the action is executed.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, to perform the task itself, the robot has to understand how its own manipulation actions produce physical effects.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For example, how does the pose of the robot's end-effector affect the outcome of a pouring action when a liquid is poured from one container to another.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">6 shows the robot Rosie pushing the spatula under pancake and envisioning the action through mental simulation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Similarly, we use the logic programming environment Prolog and utilize a physics-based robot simulator.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In addition, we have integrated methods for making simulation-based temporal projections into Prolog's backtracking mechanism in order to perform reasoning about action parameterizations for robot manipulation tasks.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As stated earlier, the framework's interface is based on first-order representations.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We employ Prolog{sup:5} to realize the interface of the envisioning framework.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Given domain knowledge (a knowledge base), a scenario description and an action plan, Prolog initializes and orchestrates the overall envisioning process and eventually evaluates the resulting timelines.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">One of the main constituents of the envisioning process is a physics-based simulation in which a specified robot performs manipulation actions according to its parameterized action plan.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Within our approach, we utilize the physics-based simulator Gazebo{sup:11} to compute the effects of robot actions, object interactions and other physical events.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">{a mathematical formula} For example, the event of cooking the pancake mix is formalized as{a mathematical formula} Actions of a robot can be represented similarly.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Pouring the pancake mix can be represented as{a mathematical formula}</a>
