<a href="#0" id="0">Matching gameA matching game is a coalition formation game with {a mathematical formula}|C|=2 for all {a mathematical formula}C ∈ C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Every possible coalition is an edge {a mathematical formula}e ∈ E with edge benefit {a mathematical formula}b(e).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">More formally, in a social coalition formation game there is a set {a mathematical formula}H of graphs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A state {a mathematical formula}S is a socially stable state if it has no social blocking coalition.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A coalition C is a local blocking coalition if it is a blocking coalition and accessible, and a locally stable state is a state {a mathematical formula}S without a locally blocking coalition.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then C is accessible in {a mathematical formula}S if{a mathematical formula} A coalition C is a considerate blocking coalition if it is a blocking coalition and accessible, and a state {a mathematical formula}S without considerate blocking coalitions is a considerate stable state.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A state {a mathematical formula}S without perceived blocking coalition is a perceived or friendship stable state (for an example see Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For a feasible state {a mathematical formula}S, a blocking coalition C is an undominated candidate coalition.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">At least one coalition in {a mathematical formula}R intersects with the dominated coalition.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In consequence, when adding a blocking coalition C into {a mathematical formula}S ′ , several coalitions might become dominated.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Every coalition can always be generated {a mathematical formula}Cg=E.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For considerate stable matching, we saw above that the domination rules are of the form {a mathematical formula}(e ′ ,e) with a single coalition in the precondition.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">While the coalitions corresponding to {a mathematical formula}V2,end are stable, they do not represent a stable state.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The set of agents is V, the set of possible coalitions is {a mathematical formula}C=E.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Now {a mathematical formula}C4,1 is not a blocking coalition anymore.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">At this point, the only local blocking coalition again is {a mathematical formula}C0.</a>
