<a href="#0" id="0">We consider the correctness of MCheck({a mathematical formula}M,w, Φ ) to be immediately clear, but it remains to show that it requires at most polynomial space.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The second important observation is that (assuming that it is defined) each {a mathematical formula} Φ n+1 is a consistent theory, since they are of the form {a mathematical formula} Φ n+ Ψ with {a mathematical formula}¬ Ψ ∉ Φ n.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Firstly, suppose that {a mathematical formula}[U][ ↕ ] Ψ ∈ Φ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Observe that {a mathematical formula}[U]([ ↕ ] Ψ → [U0] Ψ ) ∈ Φ and {a mathematical formula}[U]([ ↕ ] Ψ → [U0] Ψ ) → ([U][ ↕ ] Ψ → [U][U0] Ψ ) for every {a mathematical formula}U0 ∈ LAUL, since both formulas are derivable in {a mathematical formula}LAAUL.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, Φ is closed under (R1), so {a mathematical formula}[U][U0] Ψ ∈ Φ .The update {a mathematical formula}U0, being an element of {a mathematical formula}LAUL, does not contain any {a mathematical formula}[ ↕ ] operators.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As such, the {a mathematical formula}[ ↕ ]-depth of {a mathematical formula}[U][U0] Ψ is strictly lower than that of {a mathematical formula}[U][ ↕ ] Ψ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We therefore have {a mathematical formula}[U][U0] Ψ <ds[U][ ↕ ] Ψ , so by the induction hypothesis our assumption that {a mathematical formula}[U][U0] Ψ ∈ Φ yields the conclusion that {a mathematical formula}Mc, Φ ⊨ [U][U0] Ψ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By the semantics of AAUL, the latter is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}Mc ⁎ U, Φ ⊨ [U0] Ψ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that this holds for all {a mathematical formula}U0 ∈ LAUL, so {a mathematical formula}Mc ⁎ U, Φ ⊨ [ ↕ ] Ψ and therefore {a mathematical formula}Mc, Φ ⊨ [U][ ↕ ] Ψ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We have shown that {a mathematical formula}[U][ ↕ ] Ψ ∈ Φ ⇒ Mc, Φ ⊨ [U][ ↕ ] Ψ .Suppose then that {a mathematical formula}Mc, Φ ⊨ [U][ ↕ ] Ψ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">By the induction hypothesis, this implies that {a mathematical formula}[U][U0] Ψ ∈ Φ for all {a mathematical formula}U0 ∈ LAUL.</a>
