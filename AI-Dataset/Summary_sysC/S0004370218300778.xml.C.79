<a href="#0" id="0">Given the recursive nature of the attacks in our system, in order to define which arguments will be accepted, and thus which conclusions will be obtained, we will use the Argumentation Framework with Recursive Attacks (AFRA) introduced in [3], [4], which allows attacks to the attack relation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We will use acceptability semantics (in particular preferred extensions) to determine which are the accepted arguments in our system, and then, we will formally show that the conclusions of an extension from a credibility base constitute a partial order with respect to the credibility relation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A credibility object is a pair {a mathematical formula}[P>Q,S] which represents that agent P is strictly more credible than Q, and the agent S is the information source of the credibility element{a mathematical formula}P>Q.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Each credibility element that can be inferred from a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C will have an argument associated that supports it, and such argument will contain the reliability information for that inference.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">ArgumentLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base, {a mathematical formula}A be a set of agents, and {a mathematical formula}B,C ∈ A where {a mathematical formula}B ≠ C, an argument {a mathematical formula}X for the conclusion {a mathematical formula}B>C from {a mathematical formula}C is a set of credibility objects {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ C, such that {a mathematical formula}B>C ∈ cl(X) and there is no {a mathematical formula}X ′ ⊂ X holding that {a mathematical formula}B>C ∈ cl(X ′ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For instance, the set {a mathematical formula}N={[A>C,K],[C>B,H],[B>A,J]} is not an argument because for any potential conclusion in {a mathematical formula}cl(N) the set {a mathematical formula}N is not minimal.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given an argument {a mathematical formula}X, the set {a mathematical formula}rel(X) contains all the agent identifiers which are sources of the credibility objects in {a mathematical formula}X, and hence {a mathematical formula}rel(X) represents the reliability of {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For convenience, given a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C we will denote with {a mathematical formula}TAttsC the set of trust-attacks from {a mathematical formula}C, with {a mathematical formula}RAttsC the set of reliability-attacks from {a mathematical formula}C, and with {a mathematical formula}IAttsC the set of indirect-reliability-attacks from {a mathematical formula}C. Below we will explain the intuitions that motivate each type of attack and present their definitions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Recall that given an argument {a mathematical formula}X the set {a mathematical formula}rel(X) represents the reliability of {a mathematical formula}X and contains all the agent identifiers that are sources of the credibility objects in {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The new credibility object represents that the newsletter Y-invest (abbreviated Y) has informed that agent J is more credible than H. Note that from {a mathematical formula}C5 we have the same arguments and attacks shown in Example 4 and, in addition, the argument {a mathematical formula}A5={[J>H,Y]} can be built.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Following [4], the first step towards determining the accepted arguments from an associated AFRA {a mathematical formula}(ArgsC,AttsC) is to establish the existing attacks and consequent defeats.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As it was mentioned, the justification state of a credibility element (e.g., {a mathematical formula}A>B) in a base {a mathematical formula}C will depend on the status of the argument that supports that credibility element in the associated AFRA {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC,AttsC 〉 ; in turn, this status depends on the membership to an extension of such an argument.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Note that, given a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, there always exists an associated AFRA from which it is possible to obtain the extensions containing the acceptable arguments; hence, we will introduce to our framework the notion of extension of a credibility base that considers preferred extensions which satisfy a particular constraint.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In addition, note that if {a mathematical formula}ECs4 was considered an extension of {a mathematical formula}Cs, the set of justified credibilities for such extension would had been {a mathematical formula}{O>P,P>Q,Q>O} which clearly is not coherent with what we expect from a set of justified credibilities.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">As we mentioned in the introduction of this article, one of the main goals of our system was to determine from a potentially conflicting credibility base a strict partial order representing the credibilities that can be coherently justified.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As reported in [36], a set of justified credibilities from a credibility base is sound if it is a strict partial order.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The following theorem shows that our approach is sound, i.e., every set of justified credibilities obtained from a credibility base is sound.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Consider finally that from the same website it can be inferred that {a mathematical formula}[A>B,X], then our proposed approach can be applied to decide between two contradictory answers given by users G and H, using more information than the rankings of these answers.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">To address this issue, in [36] the authors formalized change operators over a credibility base following belief revision techniques aiming to maintain credibility bases without contradictory information.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">There, in order to determine which information prevails when contradictory information arises, a reliability function was used to obtain a set of agent identifiers which represents the credibility of a given credibility element, and it considers all the agent identifiers involved in every minimal proof of that credibility element.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">They follow a cautious approach: the function first obtains the set with the least credible agent identifiers from each proof, and then, if there exist more than one proof, the most credible identifiers of the resulting set.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">For this reason, in this article, we defined an argumentation formalism with recursive attacks which provides the capability to infer a strict partial order from a credibility base (without contradictory information).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Even if this can be seen as similar to the credibility base of our proposal, their efficacy measure is a partial order while our bases, as we have shown in various examples, are not necessarily ordered.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">These four kinds of arguments are based on an inference rule and the trust evaluation of the agent, that is represented with an interval {a mathematical formula}[t − ,t+] over a discrete scale S, with the intended meaning that the trust is not larger than t+ and not smaller than t − .</a>
