<a href="#0" id="0">Given an element {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Ω , we can ask how appropriate a given label is to describe it.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is quantified by a membership function, denoted {a mathematical formula} Μ Li(x), corresponding to the probability that the distance from x to {a mathematical formula}Pi, the prototype of {a mathematical formula}Li, is less than the threshold {a mathematical formula} Ε i, as given by:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each label {a mathematical formula}Li is entirely defined by its prototype {a mathematical formula}Pi, the distance metric in the space {a mathematical formula}d(x,y) and the distribution {a mathematical formula} Δ i of the threshold {a mathematical formula} Ε i.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We can therefore, given a particular conceptual space Ω , use the notation {a mathematical formula}Li=<Pi,di, Δ i> to completely describe the label {a mathematical formula}Li.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The idea of a membership function presented here may be compared with the similarity relation that Gärdenfors uses.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A similarity relation between points in a conceptual space may be defined as a decreasing function of distance in the space.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Gärdenfors gives the example that the similarity {a mathematical formula}s(x,y) between two points x and y in the conceptual space is an exponentially decaying function of the distance {a mathematical formula}d(x,y) between the two points, i.e.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}s(x,y)=exp ⁡ ( − cd(x,y)).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In terms of the prototype-threshold approach outlined above, the membership of an element x in a concept L may then be defined as the similarity to the prototype P of L, where {a mathematical formula} Ε ∼ Exp(c).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">More generally, {a mathematical formula}s(x,y)= Δ (d(x,y)).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Each label {a mathematical formula}Li is defined by the triple {a mathematical formula}<Pi,di, Δ i>, as described in section 3, where the prototype {a mathematical formula}Pi ⊆ Ω i, {a mathematical formula}di is the distance metric in {a mathematical formula} Ω i, the threshold {a mathematical formula} Ε i is a random variable into {a mathematical formula}R+ and {a mathematical formula} Δ i is a probability density on {a mathematical formula} Ε i.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We can then define a Boolean variable {a mathematical formula}Xi into {a mathematical formula}{0,1} with reference to a point {a mathematical formula}Yi ∈ Ω i for {a mathematical formula}i=1, … ,n as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">A vector {a mathematical formula}Y → ∈ Ω 1× … × Ω n generates a Boolean vector {a mathematical formula}X → into {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n. In this case, the probability distribution for {a mathematical formula}Xi is determined by {a mathematical formula} Δ i.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We think of the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n as the binary conjunction space, and of {a mathematical formula}x → Α as the prototype of the conjunctive concept Α .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We also allow some deviation from the prototype by taking into account the different levels of importance of each label {a mathematical formula}Li.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The differing importance of the labels is characterised by a weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → which weights each dimension in the binary space.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">These ideas are illustrated in Fig.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">5.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">We can now consider membership in the conjunctive concept within the binary space.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">A conjunctive concept is defined by the triple {a mathematical formula} Α =<x → Α ,d, Δ > where Α is an atom of LA, d is a distance on {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n, Ε is a random variable in {a mathematical formula}R+ and Δ is a probability distribution on Ε .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We say that an element {a mathematical formula}X → ∈ {0,1}n can be appropriately described by the concept Α iff {a mathematical formula}d(x → Α ,X → ) ≤ Ε with the membership function defined by:{a mathematical formula} We can then relate membership in {a mathematical formula} Ω 1× Ω 2×...× Ω n to membership in the binary space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n as follows.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">More generally, we can define a compound concept with prototypical case {a mathematical formula} Θ = ⋀ I±Li, where {a mathematical formula}I ⊆ {1,...,n}, as a triple {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,d, Δ > where:{a mathematical formula}P is therefore a set of points which all have the same values on the dimension specified by the index set I, and cover all remaining possibilities across the dimensions not in I.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">This implies that where {a mathematical formula}I={1,...,n}, P is a singleton.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Definition 1</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">We now define a distance metric in the binary space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n based on Hamming distance and a weight vector.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">One dimensional Hamming distance{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Definition 2</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Weighted Hamming distanceFor {a mathematical formula} Λ → ∈ (R+)n,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">We now outline a correspondence between our idea of a compound concept as a conjunction of attribute labels or their negations, and Hampton's account of concepts as combinations of attributes with individual weights.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Firstly, as stated above, we model individual attributes as labels from conceptual spaces such as the colour space, or the taste space.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">We have a vector of weights, {a mathematical formula} Λ → , attached to the binary space which loosely corresponds to Hampton's attribute weights.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">However, the weights in Hampton's account range from 4, being necessary, to − 2, being impossible.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">In contrast, our weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → is always positive, and the idea of an attribute {a mathematical formula}Li being atypical or impossible is captured by the notion that the conjunction {a mathematical formula} ⋀ i=1n±Li includes {a mathematical formula}¬Li.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">The extent of the atypicality of the attribute {a mathematical formula}Li is then given by the weight {a mathematical formula} Λ i of the corresponding dimension.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">The example above shows that the membership functions generated within this framework can be very flexible.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">However, we show that by restricting the type of membership function used in the binary combination space, we can derive an expression for the membership function {a mathematical formula} Μ Θ (Y → ) of the compound concept {a mathematical formula} Θ = ⋀ i=1k±Li, {a mathematical formula}k ≤ n as a weighted sum of the membership functions for individual domains {a mathematical formula} Μ ±Li(Yi).</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">This grounds proposals in [19], [30], [50] that complex concepts can be built up as sums of weighted properties.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">A key aspect of concepts in Gärdenfors's conceptual spaces is that they should be convex.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">In a space {a mathematical formula}Rn with the Euclidean distance metric, convexity of a set S is defined by the property that {a mathematical formula} ∀ x,y ∈ S, every point on the line segment connecting x and y is also in S. A detailed discussion is given [19] citing experimental evidence for the fact that concepts as used by humans tend to be convex, and that the use of convex concepts requires less cognitive load.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">We give a definition of convexity for the binary combination spaces {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Definition 5</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Betweenness{a mathematical formula} ∀ x,y,z ∈ {0,1}n with distance metric {a mathematical formula}H Λ → , z is between x and y, {a mathematical formula}B(x,y,z) iff {a mathematical formula}H Λ → (x,y)=H Λ → (x,z)+H Λ → (z,y).</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">We can now generalise Theorem 4 to the case where {a mathematical formula} Θ = ⋀ i=1k±Li, {a mathematical formula}k ≤ n.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">In this case, the prototype P does not specify all values of {a mathematical formula}i=1...n. We firstly introduce some notation allowing us to talk about the set of dimensions in a prototype that remain invariant.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">We argue that if P does not specify all dimensions of {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n, then the weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → must be such that only those dimensions contributing to the concept are weighted.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">For example, suppose {a mathematical formula}n=3, {a mathematical formula}P={(1,1,1),(1,1,0)}.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Then {a mathematical formula} Λ → =(0.4,0.3,0).</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">We go on to prove that a similar result to that shown in Theorem 4 holds for Θ .</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">So with respect to membership in Θ in the binary space, the weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ ′ produces the same results as the weight vector Λ .</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">We now show that an analogue to Theorem 4 holds.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">Proof</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">Since P is convex, {a mathematical formula}H Λ → (P,X → )=H Λ → ′ (P,X → ).So{a mathematical formula}Now,{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">We can therefore convert any {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,H Λ → , Δ > with {a mathematical formula} Δ =U(0, Λ T) into {a mathematical formula} Θ ′ , such that {a mathematical formula}i ∉ E(P) → Λ i=0 via a suitable scaling of {a mathematical formula} Μ Θ (X → ) and {a mathematical formula} Μ Θ (Y → ).</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">Let {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P1,d1, Δ 1> and {a mathematical formula} Φ =<P2,d2, Δ 2> be two compound concepts consisting of a conjunction of attribute labels from individual conceptual spaces {a mathematical formula} Ω i.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">As in section 4.2 we define the following two binary variables:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">Hence {a mathematical formula}X → naturally generates {a mathematical formula}Z → =(Z1,Z2) ∈ {0,1}2.</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">We now define the conjunction of compound concepts as the triple {a mathematical formula} Θ ∧ Φ =({(1,1)},d, Δ ) where d is a distance metric on {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2.</a>
<a href="#57" id="57">In this case we can define a binary random variable C such that:{a mathematical formula} We also define the membership function for {a mathematical formula} Θ ∧ Φ as follows:{a mathematical formula} So that {a mathematical formula} Μ Θ ∧ Φ (Z → )=P(C=1|Z → ).</a>
<a href="#58" id="58">Now by applying the theorem of total probability we have that:{a mathematical formula} Then by a second application of the theorem of total probability we have that:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#59" id="59">Example 12</a>
<a href="#60" id="60">Property – concept combinationSuppose {a mathematical formula}RED=L1, {a mathematical formula}CAR=L2 ∧ L3 ∧ L4, where {a mathematical formula}CAR=<(1,1),H Λ → C,U(0,1)> with {a mathematical formula} Λ → C=(0.33,0.33,0.33) so that {a mathematical formula} Μ C(Y → )=0.33 Μ L2(Y2)+0.33 Μ L3(Y3)+0.33 Μ L4(Y4).</a>
<a href="#61" id="61">We may combine {a mathematical formula} Θ =RED ∧ CAR in the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2 with prototype (1, 1), weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ =(0.5,0.5) and boundary distribution {a mathematical formula} Δ =U(0,1).</a>

<a href="#64" id="64">To compute the necessity of a dimension i to a concept {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,H Λ → , Δ >, where {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ {0,1}n, we consider the necessity of set {a mathematical formula}Si={X → :Xi=pi}, i.e.</a>

<a href="#68" id="68">In this case we say that {a mathematical formula}Si= ∅ , since {a mathematical formula}Si must satisfy {a mathematical formula}Si={X → :Xi=0 ∧ Xi=1}.</a>

<a href="#74" id="74">We begin by defining the neighbourhood of a conjunction of two concepts.</a>
<a href="#75" id="75">Suppose that two concepts Θ and Φ are combined in the second level space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2, with weight vector {a mathematical formula}w → =(w1,w2) where {a mathematical formula}w1 is associated with Θ and {a mathematical formula}w2 with Φ .</a>
<a href="#76" id="76">Suppose {a mathematical formula}w2 ≤ w1.</a>
<a href="#77" id="77">Now, if the threshold Ε in the second level space is less than {a mathematical formula}w2, then an element {a mathematical formula}X → of the first level binary space must belong to the neighbourhoods of both concepts Θ and Φ , i.e.</a>

<a href="#79" id="79">When {a mathematical formula}w2 ≤ Ε ≤ w1, the points within Ε in the second level space are {a mathematical formula}{(1,1),(1,0)}, so {a mathematical formula}X → must belong to {a mathematical formula}N Θ Ε Θ , but does not have to belong to {a mathematical formula}N Φ Ε Φ .</a>
<a href="#80" id="80">When {a mathematical formula}w1 ≤ Ε ≤ wT, where {a mathematical formula}wT=w1+w2, {a mathematical formula}X → may belong to either neighbourhood, i.e.</a>
