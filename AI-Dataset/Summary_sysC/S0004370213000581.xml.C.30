<a href="#0" id="0">In addition to the bag-level classification function {a mathematical formula}F(X), many methods try to learn an instance-level classification function {a mathematical formula}f(x → i) that operates directly on the instances {a mathematical formula}x → i.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Throughout this work we will use uppercase to refer to bags X and to the bag-level classifier F, and we will use lowercase to refer to instances {a mathematical formula}x → and to the instance-level classifier f.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the Instance-Space (IS) paradigm, the discriminative information is considered to lie at the instance-level.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, the discriminative learning process occurs at this level: a discriminative instance-level classifier {a mathematical formula}f(x → ) is trained to separate the instances in positive bags from those in negative ones (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Based on it, given a new bag X the bag-level classifier {a mathematical formula}F(X) is obtained by simply aggregating instance-level scores {a mathematical formula}f(x → ), {a mathematical formula}x → ∈ X.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We say that this type of paradigm is based on local, instance-level information, in the sense that the learning process considers the characteristics of individual instances, without looking at more global characteristics of the whole bag.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If we look at the composition of the bags in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">5, we find that positive bags are characterized by containing instances of both class 1 and class 2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In contrast, negative bags are characterized by containing either instances of class 1 or instances of class 2, but not both of them at the same time.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore, it is not enough to learn an (instance-level) model of the classes of instances, but we must learn a bag-level model about the composition of the whole bag.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As we will see, this bag-level information can be learned if we use a BS or ES method.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Indeed, we will see that both BS and ES are successful in both the problem shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">1 and the one in Fig.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">5, while IS methods only succeed in the first type of problem.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The idea of the IS paradigm just reviewed is to estimate a model that summarizes the properties of the single instances, by discriminating those typically found in positive bags versus those found in negative ones.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This makes this type of methods consider local information, in the sense that the obtained model is about instances and not about bags as a whole.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">At classification time, the classifier {a mathematical formula}F(X) is obtained as an aggregation of local responses {a mathematical formula}f(x → ), where each of them consider only one instance {a mathematical formula}x → at a time.</a>
