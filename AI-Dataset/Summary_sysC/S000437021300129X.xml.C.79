<a href="#0" id="0">Consider an epistemic scenario wherein the agents are not only uncertain about the factual state of the world but also about the protocol that can be executed given some factual state, depicted as the model:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The uncertainty of the agents about the protocol is denoted by a state-dependent protocol assigning singleton action sets {a mathematical formula}{a} to s and {a mathematical formula}{b} to t. Note that we have omitted the reflexive arrows for agents 1 and 2 for the sake of compact representation, and we will follow this convention throughout this paper.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that an agent may expect different (even infinitely many) potential observations to happen at a given state, for example, she may expect {a mathematical formula}a … ab to happen for any finite sequence of as preceding the terminating action b.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To make such reasoning formal, we first define the update of epistemic expectation models according to some observation {a mathematical formula}w ∈ Σ ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We design the Public observation logic (POL) to reason about observations: Public observation logicThe formulas Φ of POL are given by:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P, {a mathematical formula}i ∈ I, and {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ Lobs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To make the link more precise, we can relate POL on epistemic expectation models to the same language on epistemic temporal models with the usual PDL-style interpretation of {a mathematical formula}[ Π ] Φ formulas, as we now proceed to show.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Intuitively, we associate to each protocol Η a set {a mathematical formula}Lg( Η ) of guarded observations in the form of{a mathematical formula} where each {a mathematical formula} Ρ i ⊆ P denotes a state of affairs (the atomic propositions {a mathematical formula}p ∈ Ρ are true while the others are false), encoding the conditions for the later observations to happen.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From Proposition 18, according to the protocol Η , the expected observations on a state s in an epistemic model {a mathematical formula}M can be computed by {a mathematical formula}fVM(s)( Η ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The scenario is modeled as follows, where the last model is the epistemic expectation model resulting from the update of the protocol on the first epistemic model:{a mathematical formula} Here, g denotes the fact that ‘ Kate is gay ’ , a denotes the observation of Kate making the ‘ musical statement ’ and b stands for Kate saying something else.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Consider the following epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}M; we will show that {a mathematical formula}M cannot be generated by any epistemic protocol on its epistemic skeleton:{a mathematical formula}Suppose towards contradiction that there is a protocol model {a mathematical formula}A such that the execution of {a mathematical formula}A on the epistemic skeleton of {a mathematical formula}M gives an epistemic expectation model that is bisimilar to {a mathematical formula}M. To compose {a mathematical formula}s ′ in the epistemic expectation model, we need a state t in the protocol model such that {a mathematical formula}Prot(t) allows a to happen if p is true.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It can be generated from its epistemic skeleton by updating with the public protocol {a mathematical formula}?p ⋅ b+?¬p ⋅ a or with the epistemic protocol model:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Actually, on arbitrary epistemic models, the announcement of {a mathematical formula}?p ⋅ b+?¬p ⋅ a will always yield the same result as the above epistemic protocol model.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">On the other hand, the announcement {a mathematical formula}?p ⋅ (a+b) gives a different update result on the same epistemic model compared to the update with the following epistemic protocol:{a mathematical formula} Such examples suggest a notion of equivalence between protocol models.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Truth definition for EPLGiven an epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}M = {a mathematical formula} 〈 S, ∼ ,V,Exp 〉 , a state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S, and an EPL-formula Φ , the truth conditions of Φ at s coincide with POL for the formulas that they have in common.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">As an example, let us give the model of Example 1 from the introduction, the epistemic expectation model induced by the epistemic protocol (modelled on p. 27, call it {a mathematical formula}Ae), and the updated model according to observation a (in the picture, visualized by {a mathematical formula}|a):{a mathematical formula} Recall the original model {a mathematical formula}M:{a mathematical formula} Now we can verify for the actual state s:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Finally, we are ready to prove an analogue of Proposition 18: there is a normal form of guarded regular expressions with respect to an fc-system {a mathematical formula}F in which tests only appear at the beginning.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">To this end we first introduce fact-changing epistemic expectation models and protocol models, {a mathematical formula}MexpF and {a mathematical formula}AF, given by {a mathematical formula} 〈 Mexp,F 〉 and {a mathematical formula} 〈 A,F 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}Mexp is an epistemic expectation model, {a mathematical formula}A is a protocol model and {a mathematical formula}F is a factual change system.</a>
