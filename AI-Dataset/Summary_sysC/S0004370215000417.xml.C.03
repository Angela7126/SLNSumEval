<a href="#0" id="0">As there are so many of these cluster constraints, we do not add them all initially, but rather add them to the problem as additional constraints as needed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We then identify some acyclicity constraints violated by this solution and add them to the problem before resolving.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This process is called separation, as the added constraints separate the relaxed solution from the space of valid solutions, and the added constraints are known as cuts or cutting planes as they cut off a portion of the search space containing the relaxed solution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this approach, after the relaxed problem has been solved, additional linear constraints are added to the problem which separate the current relaxed solution from the space of any valid integer solutions, i.e.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The search for the relaxed solution and the addition of extra constraints alternates until no more cuts can be found.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This approach is adopted with the cluster constraints in the BN learning problem.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For a network with {a mathematical formula}|V| nodes, there are {a mathematical formula}2|V − 1| − 1 cluster constraints; rather than initially adding such a large number of constraints, they are only added explicitly to the problem as cuts if a relaxed solution would violate them.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In practice, this means that most cluster constraints are never added to the problem as solutions with cycles involving that cluster of nodes are never proposed.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Adding problem constraints as cutting planes rather than initially is typically done when there are very large numbers of such constraints, as is the case with the cluster constraints.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These attempt to find cuts that separate more of the search space from the relaxed solution than usual methods.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For each {a mathematical formula}I(W → v) in the main problem with non-zero value in the current relaxed solution, create a binary variable {a mathematical formula}J(W → v) in the cluster constraint finding subproblem.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However, the converse does not hold; there exist cluster cuts that separate the current relaxed solution which do not correspond to cycles in G.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The current solution to a relaxed problem will always be a point on the surface of the polytope corresponding to the current relaxed problem.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Specifically, a point is chosen which lies somewhere on a line between the best known heuristic solution to the problem and the current solution to the relaxed problem, and the usual cutting plane finding methods are called to separate this point.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">These three extensions are the method by which cluster cuts are found, the point at which convex4 constraints are added and the use of close cuts.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The constraints based on the convex hull of the 4 node BN polytope can be added to the problem initially or used as cutting planes.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As before, cycle finding with a maximum length of 6, followed by the sub-IP if necessary is used with the convex hull constraints added as cutting planes only when efficacious cluster cuts are not found.</a>
