<a href="#0" id="0">Especially, we show that applying at most once each disjunctive closure principle on {a mathematical formula}L is enough, in the sense that applying one of them twice or more leads to classes polynomially equivalent to {a mathematical formula}L. We also identify the queries and transformations which are preserved by applying disjunctive closure principles.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}L satisfies CD, the conditioning transformation, if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that maps every pair {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α , Γ 〉 , where Α is a representation from {a mathematical formula}L and Γ is a consistent term, to a representation from {a mathematical formula}L that is logically equivalent to {a mathematical formula} ∃ Var( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}L satisfies FO, the forgetting transformation, if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that maps every pair {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ,X 〉 , where Α is a representation from {a mathematical formula}L and X is a set of variables from PS, to a representation from {a mathematical formula}L equivalent to {a mathematical formula} ∃ X. Α .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, the subset {a mathematical formula}L=d-DNF of DNF consisting of deterministic DNF formulae (i.e., the DNF formulae {a mathematical formula} Α = ⋁ i=1n Γ i such that for each {a mathematical formula}i,j ∈ 1, … ,n, if {a mathematical formula}i ≠ j, then the terms {a mathematical formula} Γ i and {a mathematical formula} Γ j are such that {a mathematical formula} Γ i ∧ Γ j is inconsistent) satisfies CT, but {a mathematical formula}d-DNF[ ∃ ] does not.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, we have {a mathematical formula}Var( Β )=Var( Α ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let Ω be any interpretation over {a mathematical formula}Var( Α ) and let Γ be the consistent term (unique up to logical equivalence) such that {a mathematical formula}Var( Γ )=Var( Α ) and Ω is a model of Γ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let Α be a representation from {a mathematical formula}L[ ∨ ] and {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ PS.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By construction, {a mathematical formula} Α = ∨ ( Β 1, … , Β n) where each {a mathematical formula} Β i ({a mathematical formula}i ∈ 1, … ,n) is an {a mathematical formula}L representation.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since existential quantifications “ distribute ” over ∨ , we have {a mathematical formula} ∃ X. Α ≡ ∨ ( ∃ X. Β 1, … , ∃ X. Β n).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Now, since {a mathematical formula}L satisfies FO, with each {a mathematical formula} ∃ X. Β i ({a mathematical formula}i ∈ 1, … ,n) we can associate in polynomial time an equivalent {a mathematical formula}L representation {a mathematical formula} Β i ′ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Applying the replacement metatheorem,{sup:9} we get that {a mathematical formula} ∃ X. Α ≡ ∨ ( Β 1 ′ , … , Β n ′ ).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Since the {a mathematical formula}L[ ∨ ] representation {a mathematical formula} ∨ ( Β 1 ′ , … , Β n ′ ) can be computed in polynomial time in the size of Α plus the size of X, the conclusion follows.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The fact that the validity problem for closed, prenex quantified Boolean formulae with a HORN matrix is in P[68] concludes the proof.Finally, none of {a mathematical formula}KROM[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}AFF[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∨ , ∃ ], {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∨ , ∃ ], {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ , ∃ ] satisfies VA unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP since each of those languages includes DNF as a subset and DNF does not satisfy VA unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We first show that the implicant problem for {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∃ ] formulae can be reduced in polynomial time into the implicant problem for {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∃ ] formulae.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The fact that {a mathematical formula} Α ′ and {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ are {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∃ ] formulae which can be computed in time polynomial in the size of Α shows the coNP-hardness of the sentential entailment problem for {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∃ ] formulae and concludes the proof.Finally, none of {a mathematical formula}KROM[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}AFF[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∨ , ∃ ], {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∨ , ∃ ], {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ , ∃ ] satisfies SE unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP since none of them satisfies VA unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP; the fact that ⊤ is a formula from each of these languages and that {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ C-QDAG is valid iff {a mathematical formula} ⊤ ⊨ Α concludes the proof.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Each of KROM, HORN, {a mathematical formula}K/H, renH, and AFF satisfies EQ since it satisfies SE.As to {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∃ ], {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∃ ] and {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∃ ]: for every formulae {a mathematical formula} Α ′ and {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ from {a mathematical formula}C-QDAG we have that {a mathematical formula} Α ′ ⊨ Γ ′ iff {a mathematical formula} Α ′ ∧ Γ ′ ≡ Α ′ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Consider now the formulae {a mathematical formula} Α ′ and {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ used for proving that none of {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∃ ], {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∃ ] and {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∃ ] satisfies SE unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP (see the item SE in this proof).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Together, this shows that KROM satisfies FO.The fact that AFF satisfies FO is given by Lemma 1 from [72].Now, taking advantage of the fact that for any {a mathematical formula}C-QDAG representation of the form {a mathematical formula} ∨ ( Α 1, … , Α n) and any finite subset X of PS {a mathematical formula} ∃ X. ∨ ( Α 1, … , Α n) is logically equivalent to {a mathematical formula} ∨ ( ∃ X. Α 1, … , ∃ X. Α n), we get that each of {a mathematical formula}KROM[ ∨ ] and {a mathematical formula}AFF[ ∨ ] satisfies FO.It remains to consider the cases of HORN, {a mathematical formula}K/H, renH and of their disjunction closures.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">that Α is simplified, i.e., for every XOR-clause {a mathematical formula} Δ =l1 ⊕ … ⊕ lk of Α , either Δ reduces to ⊥ , or every literal in Δ is positive or equal to ⊤ and Δ does not contain more than one occurrence of any variable and of ⊤ (if this is not the case it is sufficient to exploit the equivalences {a mathematical formula}¬x ≡ x ⊕ ⊤ , {a mathematical formula} Β ⊕ Β ≡ ⊥ , {a mathematical formula} Β ⊕ ⊥ ≡ Β to render Α simplified while preserving logical equivalence); it is easy to check that if Α is a simplified AFF formula containing a variable from X, then {a mathematical formula} ∀ X. Α is equivalent to ⊥ , otherwise {a mathematical formula} ∀ X. Δ is equivalent to Α .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Determining whether a conjunction of clauses is consistent cannot be achieved in (deterministic) polynomial time unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP (this is the famous sat problem).</a>

<a href="#21" id="21">Let Α and Β be two {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∨ , ∃ ] formulae.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">From Proposition 2, since HORN is stable by uniform renaming, one can compute in polynomial time a {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∨ ][ ∃ ] formula {a mathematical formula} ∃ X. Α ′ (resp.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">{a mathematical formula} ∃ Y. Β ′ ) equivalent to Α (resp.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Β ) where {a mathematical formula} Α ′ (resp.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">{a mathematical formula} Β ′ ) is a {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∨ ] formula.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Let {a mathematical formula} Α ″ (resp.</a>

<a href="#31" id="31">{a mathematical formula} Β ″ ).</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">By construction {a mathematical formula} Α ∧ Β is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}( ∃ X. Α ′ ) ∧ ( ∃ Y. Β ′ ), which is in turn equivalent to {a mathematical formula} ∃ X ′ ∪ Y ′ .( Α ″ ∧ Β ″ ).</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Now, {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∨ ] satisfies ∧ BC.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Hence, a {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∨ ] formula Γ equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Α ″ ∧ Β ″ can be generated in time polynomial in the size of {a mathematical formula} Α ″ plus the size of {a mathematical formula} Β ″ .</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Accordingly, {a mathematical formula} ∃ X ′ ∪ Y ′ . Γ is a {a mathematical formula}HORN[ ∨ , ∃ ] formula equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Α ∧ Β , and it can be computed in time polynomial in the size of Α plus the size of Β .Finally, let us consider the cases of {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ ], {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∨ , ∃ ], {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ , ∃ ].</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Observe that {a mathematical formula} Β ′ is consistent, hence each of {a mathematical formula} Α ′ and {a mathematical formula} Β ′ is a {a mathematical formula}K/H formula and renH formula.</a>

<a href="#38" id="38">Furthermore, both {a mathematical formula} Α ′ and {a mathematical formula} Β ′ can be computed in time polynomial in the size of Α .</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">By construction, Α is consistent iff {a mathematical formula} Α ′ ∧ Β ′ is consistent.</a>

<a href="#44" id="44">Each of Α and Β belongs as well to {a mathematical formula}K/H, renH, {a mathematical formula}K/H[ ∃ ], {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∃ ].</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Now, {a mathematical formula} Α ∨ Β is logically equivalent to the formula {a mathematical formula}(x ∨ y ∨ z) ∧ (¬x ∨ ¬y ∨ ¬z) for which no equivalent KROM formula (resp.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">{a mathematical formula}K/H formula, renH formula) exists.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">The point is that if Β has a {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∃ ][ ∨ ] representation as a disjunction of {a mathematical formula}mrenH[ ∃ ] formulae, then it also has a {a mathematical formula}renH[ ∨ ] representation as a disjunction of mrenH formulae.Since each {a mathematical formula} Γ i ({a mathematical formula}i ∈ 1, … ,m) is a renH formula which entails {a mathematical formula} Α n, from [75], there exists a model {a mathematical formula}Vi of {a mathematical formula} Α n such that {a mathematical formula}Vi is a Horn renaming for {a mathematical formula} Γ i, and {a mathematical formula}Vi( Γ i) ⊨ Vi( Α n).</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">Subsequently, from the pigeon/hole principle, every {a mathematical formula}AFF[ ∨ ] formula equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Α n must contain at least {a mathematical formula} ⌈ (32)n ⌉ AFF formulae as disjuncts.</a>
