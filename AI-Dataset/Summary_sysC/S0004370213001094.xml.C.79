<a href="#0" id="0">A partial interpretation S of Σ is an acc-answer set of an AC program Π if S is minimal (in the sense of set-theoretic inclusion) among the partial interpretations of Σ satisfying the rules of {a mathematical formula}(ground( Π ) ∪ M)S, where M is the set of all mixed atoms occurring in S. We note that this is a generalization of the answer set definition presented in [1] to the case of programs with doubly negated atoms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}ac( Π ) is a super-safe program (by its construction and function V definition).Left-to-right: Let X be a constraint answer set of Π according to the definition in [2].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then there is an assignment{a mathematical formula}A:V[ Π ] → D[ Π ] such that X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π A defined in [2], where {a mathematical formula}V[ Π ] denotes the set of all clingcon variables occurring in Π and {a mathematical formula}D[ Π ] is a set of constraint constants.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We now show that {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}ac( Π ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By the definition, {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}ac( Π ) if {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of{a mathematical formula} By Proposition 11, {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of (15) iff X is an answer set of{a mathematical formula} The transformation described in Observation 1 applied to (16) will result in {a mathematical formula} Π A.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We are given that X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π A.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consequently, it is an answer set of (16).Right-to-left: Let M be a functional set of ground atoms of Σ and X be a set of ground atoms such that {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}ac( Π ).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let {a mathematical formula}V[ Π ] denote the set of all clingcon variables occurring in Π .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">From the fact that M is a functional set it follows that for every variable {a mathematical formula}p(r → ) ∈ V[ Π ] there is an atom of the form {a mathematical formula}p(r → ,c) in M. We can construct an assignment A for {a mathematical formula}V[ Π ] as follows: for every variable {a mathematical formula}p(r → ) ∈ V[ Π ], {a mathematical formula}A(p(r → ))=c where {a mathematical formula}p(r → ,c) ∈ M.By the definition of an answer set for an AC program, {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of (15).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We now note that the transformation described in Observation 1 applied to {a mathematical formula} Π (Q) ′ results in a program identical to {a mathematical formula}[ Π ,M]R. We derive that {a mathematical formula}Y+ is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}[ Π ,M]R.From the fact that I is a query an interpretation, it follows that there is an input answer set A of {a mathematical formula} Π D w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It is easy to see that set {a mathematical formula}(QD,C+) Ξ ∪ (QD,C − ) Ξ is a splitting set of {a mathematical formula} Π Ξ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The bottom part of {a mathematical formula} Π Ξ (relevant to this splitting set) consists of choice rules for each atom occurring in {a mathematical formula}(QD,C) Ξ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">It follows that {a mathematical formula}(QD,C+) Ξ is an answer set of the bottom.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let U denote {a mathematical formula}(QD,C+) Ξ ∪ (QD,C − ) Ξ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Note that {a mathematical formula}eU( Π Ξ ∖ bU( Π Ξ ),(QD,C+) Ξ ) coincides with {a mathematical formula} Π (Q) ′ .Left-to-right: Let X be an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π (Q).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">By the Theorem on Constraints [24] it follows that X is also an answer set of the program {a mathematical formula} Π (Q) ′ .</a>
