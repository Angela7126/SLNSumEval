<a href="#0" id="0">Consider an epistemic scenario wherein the agents are not only uncertain about the factual state of the world but also about the protocol that can be executed given some factual state, depicted as the model:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To make such reasoning formal, we first define the update of epistemic expectation models according to some observation {a mathematical formula}w ∈ Σ ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The idea behind an updated expectation model is that we delete the states where the observation w could not have been happened.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}V(s)=V ′ (s ′ );</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}L(Exp(s))=L(Exp ′ (s ′ ));</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}p ∈ V ′ (s,w) ⇔ p ∈ V(s).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This protocol (call it {a mathematical formula} Π K) can be expressed as {a mathematical formula}?pD ⋅ a ⋅ b ⋅ a+?¬pD ⋅ a ⋅ b.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From Proposition 18, according to the protocol Η , the expected observations on a state s in an epistemic model {a mathematical formula}M can be computed by {a mathematical formula}fVM(s)( Η ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For example, {a mathematical formula}f{p}(?p ⋅ a+?¬p ⋅ b)=a.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, not every epistemic expectation model can be generated by a single protocol.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Protocol updateGiven an epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}Mexp= 〈 S, ∼ ,V,Exp 〉 and an epistemic protocol model {a mathematical formula}A= 〈 T, ∼ ,Prot 〉 , we define the product {a mathematical formula}(Mexp ⊗ A)=(S ′ , ∼ ′ ,V ′ ,Exp ′ ) as follows:</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}V ′ (s,t)=V(s);</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Given an epistemic expectation model{a mathematical formula}M=(N,Exp), there is an epistemic model{a mathematical formula}N ′ and an epistemic protocol model{a mathematical formula}Asuch that{a mathematical formula}M ↔ ̲ oN ′ ⊗ A.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This result shows that every epistemic expectation model is reasonable in the sense that it can be generated from an epistemic model by some epistemic protocol model.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">However, it is more intuitive to consider the particular epistemic model {a mathematical formula}N in {a mathematical formula}M=(N,Exp), and ask if there is a protocol model {a mathematical formula}A such that {a mathematical formula}N ⊗ A ↔ ̲ oM.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For singleton protocol models, we have a characterization result.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Consider the following epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}M; we will show that {a mathematical formula}M cannot be generated by any epistemic protocol on its epistemic skeleton:{a mathematical formula}Suppose towards contradiction that there is a protocol model {a mathematical formula}A such that the execution of {a mathematical formula}A on the epistemic skeleton of {a mathematical formula}M gives an epistemic expectation model that is bisimilar to {a mathematical formula}M. To compose {a mathematical formula}s ′ in the epistemic expectation model, we need a state t in the protocol model such that {a mathematical formula}Prot(t) allows a to happen if p is true.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In the introduction, we stated that one epistemic expectation model might be generated in different ways, even based on the same epistemic model.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">For example, consider the following expectation model:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">It can be generated from its epistemic skeleton by updating with the public protocol {a mathematical formula}?p ⋅ b+?¬p ⋅ a or with the epistemic protocol model:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Effective equivalenceTwo protocol models {a mathematical formula}A and {a mathematical formula}B are said to be effectively equivalent (notation: {a mathematical formula}A ≡ efB) if for any epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}M:M ⊗ A ↔ ̲ oM ⊗ B.</a>

<a href="#23" id="23">Language of EPLThe formulas Φ of EPL are given by:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P, {a mathematical formula}i ∈ I, {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ Lobs, and {a mathematical formula}Ae is an epistemic protocol with the designated state e.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The models for the logic EPL are taken to be the epistemic expectation models {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 S, ∼ ,V,Exp 〉 .</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Truth definition for EPLGiven an epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}M = {a mathematical formula} 〈 S, ∼ ,V,Exp 〉 , a state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S, and an EPL-formula Φ , the truth conditions of Φ at s coincide with POL for the formulas that they have in common.</a>

<a href="#28" id="28">To this end we first introduce fact-changing epistemic expectation models and protocol models, {a mathematical formula}MexpF and {a mathematical formula}AF, given by {a mathematical formula} 〈 Mexp,F 〉 and {a mathematical formula} 〈 A,F 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}Mexp is an epistemic expectation model, {a mathematical formula}A is a protocol model and {a mathematical formula}F is a factual change system.</a>
