<a href="#1" id="1">An election {a mathematical formula}E=(C,V) consists of a finite candidate set C and a finite collection V of votes over the candidates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the CCAC problem for R we are given two disjoint sets of candidates, C and A, a collection V of votes over {a mathematical formula}C ∪ A, a candidate {a mathematical formula}p ∈ C, and a nonnegative integer K. We ask whether there is a set {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊆ A such that (a) {a mathematical formula} ‖ A ′ ‖ ⩽ K, and (b) p is a winner of R election {a mathematical formula}(C ∪ A ′ ,V).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For each{a mathematical formula} Α 1 ⩾ Α 2> Α 3, CCWM for{a mathematical formula}( Α 1, Α 2, Α 3)elections over 1-maverick-SP societies is NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In contrast, for single-peaked societies (without mavericks), 3-candidate CCWM is NP-complete when {a mathematical formula}( Α 1 − Α 3)>2( Α 2 − Α 3)>0 and is in P otherwise [40].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">So, in particular, 3-candidate veto and 3-candidate Borda elections are in P for the single-peaked case, but are already NP-complete for “ single-peaked except with one maverick allowed, ” i.e., for 1-maverick-SP societies.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let L be society ʼ s order.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">each candidate in {a mathematical formula}G ′ has 1 point.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We set {a mathematical formula}G ′ to be a set of (new, distinct) {a mathematical formula}(4k+2)N(t − 1) candidates.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The following holds for swoon-SP elections.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For each t, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that given an instance of CCDV for t-approval elections finds a number s such that the minimal number of voters that we have to delete from our input election in order to ensure the preferred candidate ʼ s victory is between{a mathematical formula}12sand s.Let {a mathematical formula}E=(C,V) be our input election and let L be our given societal axis with respect to which E is a swoon-SP election.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let p be our preferred candidate.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let{a mathematical formula}(C,V)be an election where{a mathematical formula}C={c1, … ,cm}is a set of candidates, V is a collection of voters whose preferences are single-peaked with respect to societal axis L, and where{a mathematical formula}c1Lc2L … Lcm.</a>
