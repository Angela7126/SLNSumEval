<a href="#0" id="0">Given a program P and a set {a mathematical formula}X → of program variables including all variables used in P, we define inductively the set of axioms for P and {a mathematical formula}X → , written {a mathematical formula} Π PX → , as follows:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, {a mathematical formula} Π PX → is unique up to the renaming of these new functions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In our framework, a program P with variables {a mathematical formula}X → is represented by a set of sentences, {a mathematical formula} Π PX → .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a program P and a set {a mathematical formula}X → of program variables including all variables used in P, we again use {a mathematical formula} Π PX → to denote the set of axioms for P and {a mathematical formula}X → :</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Now consider our translation {a mathematical formula} Π PX → .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given a model M of {a mathematical formula} Π PX → , we can project it on {a mathematical formula}LX → as usual.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By inductive assumption, suppose now M is a model of {a mathematical formula} Π PX → .</a>
