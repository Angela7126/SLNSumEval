<a href="#0" id="0">The concept of Σ -optimal coalition structure illustrated in the above section is clearly more general than the counterpart where no valuation structure Σ is considered.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Indeed, given any coalitional game {a mathematical formula} Γ = 〈 N,v 〉 , by defining {a mathematical formula} ⊥ = 〈 KN 〉 as the valuation structure where {a mathematical formula}KN is the complete interaction graph over the set N of agents, we can immediately check that any coalition {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ N is ⊥ -feasible and that {a mathematical formula}val ⊥ (v,S)=v(S) holds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, results in the literature where no valuation structures have been considered (see Section 1) can be viewed as results that hold over ⊥ -optimal coalition structures.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An instance for the coalition structure generation problem on valuation structures, denoted in the following as {a mathematical formula}CSGval, is a pair {a mathematical formula}( Γ , Σ ), where {a mathematical formula} Γ =(N,v) is a coalitional game, and {a mathematical formula} Σ = 〈 G,S, Α , Β ,x,y 〉 is a valuation structure on Γ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The goal is to compute a Σ -optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ ∈ CS-opt Σ ( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The problem generalizes on the valuation structure Σ the well-known coalition structure generation problem (short: CSG), which is just the special case where the trivial valuation structure ⊥ is considered.</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">Let {a mathematical formula} Γ = 〈 N,v 〉 ∈ CTW-h(mcn), with {a mathematical formula}N={a1, … ,an}, be a coalitional game and let {a mathematical formula} Σ = 〈 G,S, Α , Β ,x,y 〉 be an associated valuation structure where {a mathematical formula}G=AG( Ξ mcn( Γ )).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">That is, interactions are constrained by the underlying agent graph (cf.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Theorem 4.3).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The CSP instance associated with Γ and Σ , denoted by {a mathematical formula}CSP( Γ , Σ )= 〈 Var,U,C 〉 , is defined as follows:</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We conclude our analysis by considering the chromatic clustering problem.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Recall from Section 2.2 that the problem has been reduced to computing a {a mathematical formula} Σ ch-optimal coalition structure for the game {a mathematical formula} 〈 N,vch 〉 , where {a mathematical formula} Σ ch= 〈 GC,C,1,0,0, − ∞ 〉 and where {a mathematical formula}vch is any valuation function such that, for each set of nodes {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ N ∪ C with {a mathematical formula}C ∩ C={ci}, {a mathematical formula}vch(C)= ∑ e ∈ E,e ⊆ Cweci (see Theorem B.4 in Appendix B).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Moreover, recall that {a mathematical formula}GC is the graph where colors are viewed as nodes and where an edge is added between each node in N and each color in {a mathematical formula}C. Then, the following can be established.</a>
