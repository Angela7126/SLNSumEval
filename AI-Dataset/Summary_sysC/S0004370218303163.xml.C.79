<a href="#0" id="0">In this document we propose a new approach to this problem, based on the initial hypothesis that abductive reasoning properly accounts for the human ability to identify and characterize the patterns appearing in a time series.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An abstraction pattern represents a set of constraints that must be satisfied by some evidence in order to be interpreted as the hypothetical observation of a certain process, together with an observation procedure providing a set of measurements for the features of the conjectured observation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The knowledge of the domain is described as a set of abstraction patterns as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}h Ψ (Ah,Thb,The) is an observable of the domain playing the role of a hypothesis on the observation of an underlying process Ψ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We can estimate the attribute values {a mathematical formula}( Α , Ω ,Thb,The) of this process by a simple observation procedure Θ that calculates {a mathematical formula} Α =max(|Vi|), for {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≤ n, i.e., the amplitude Α is obtained as the maximum absolute value of the observations; {a mathematical formula} Ω = Π /mean(Tjpeak − Tj − 1peak), where {a mathematical formula}Tjpeak are point observations representing a peak, satisfying {a mathematical formula}(Vjpeak=Vk,Tjpeak=Tk) ∧ sign(Vk − Vk − 1) ≠ sign(Vk+1 − Vk), so that the frequency Ω is obtained as the inverse of the mean temporal separation between consecutive peaks in the sequence of observations; and {a mathematical formula}Thb=T1,The=Tn, i.e., the temporal support of the hypothesis is the time interval between the first and the last evidence points.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In general, an abstraction process can involve a number of different findings, even multiple findings of the same observable, and a set of constraints among them; thus, for example, a regular sequence of normal heartbeats allows us to conjecture the observation of a sinus rhythm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">An abstraction pattern establishes, through the set {a mathematical formula}CP, the conditions for conjecturing the observation of h from a set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP, and through the observation procedure {a mathematical formula} Θ P, the calculations for producing a new observation {a mathematical formula}oh ∈ O(h) from the observation of these findings.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">According to the definition, an abstraction pattern is defined over a fixed set of evidence findings {a mathematical formula}MP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since a formal grammar is simply a syntactic specification of a set of strings, every grammar {a mathematical formula}G ∈ Gap is semantically extended to an attribute grammar [1], embedded with a set of actions to be performed in order to incrementally build an abstraction pattern by the application of production rules.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}PGh gathers the set of abstraction patterns that share the same observable h as a hypothesis; thus, these represent the different ways to conjecture h. Using this method, the application of every production incrementally adds a new observable as a finding and a set of constraints between this finding and previous entities, as follows:</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this case, an observation procedure Θ is not necessary since the attributes of the hypothesis are completely determined by the constraints in the grammar, and do not require additional calculus.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Note that in terms of the {a mathematical formula}{N,V} symbols the {a mathematical formula}GVB grammar is syntactically equivalent to the regular expression {a mathematical formula}NV(NV)+.In this example, as in 3.5, an observation procedure {a mathematical formula} Θ P is not necessary, since the constraints in the grammar completely determine the temporal endpoints of the hypothesis and there are no more attributes to be valued.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Informally, an interpretation problem arises from the availability of a set of initial observations from a given system, and of domain knowledge formalized as a set {a mathematical formula}G={Gq1, … ,Gqn} of {a mathematical formula}Gap grammars.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As discussed above, any observable {a mathematical formula}q ∈ QP can appear multiple times as different pieces of evidence for an abstraction pattern P, in the form of findings collected in the set {a mathematical formula}MP.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As a consequence, P can predict multiple observations of the set {a mathematical formula}O for a given observable {a mathematical formula}q ∈ QP, each of these corresponding to one of the findings of the set {a mathematical formula}MP through a matching relation.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A matching relation makes an assignment of a set of observations to a set of findings of a certain pattern, leading us to understand the interpretation problem as a search within the available evidence for a valid assignment for the constraints represented in an abstraction pattern.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">From the notion of matching relation we can design a mechanism for abductively interpreting a subset of observations in {a mathematical formula}O through the use of abstraction patterns.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">These conditions entail: (1) an abstraction hypothesis guesses an observation of the observable hypothesized by the pattern; (2) a new observation is obtained from the application of the observation procedure to those observations being assigned to the set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP by the matching relation; and (3) the observations taking part in an abstraction hypothesis must satisfy those constraints of the pattern whose variables are assigned a value by the observations.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">An important default assumption in the abstraction of a periodic process states that consecutive observations are related by taking part in the same hypothesis, defining the basic period of the process.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">An abstraction hypothesis defines in the set of observations {a mathematical formula}O a counterpart of the subsets {a mathematical formula}AP and {a mathematical formula}EP of the set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP of a pattern P, resulting from the selection of a set of observations {a mathematical formula}O Ħ ⊆ O by means of a matching relation, satisfying those requirements shown in the Definition 11.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Given an interpretation problem IP and an abstraction hypothesis {a mathematical formula} Ħ = 〈 oh,P, ↢ 〉 , we define the following sets of observations:</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">As a result of an abstraction hypothesis, a new observation {a mathematical formula}oh is generated which can be included in the set of domain observations, so that {a mathematical formula}O=O ∪ {oh}.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Since each abstraction hypothesis involves a different abstraction pattern there are no alternative hypotheses in any interpretation of {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S).Suppose there is a set covering {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ S of U of size k or less.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">That is, the set of abstraction hypotheses I is an exclusive cover of the interpretation problem {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) of size k or less.Following the same reasoning as for the set covering optimization problem, finding a minimal and a exclusive cover of an interpretation problem {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) is NP-hard, since we can use the solution of this problem to check whether there is an exclusive cover of the interpretation problem of size k or less, and this has been proven above to be NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The major source of complexity of searching for a solution is the local selection, from the available evidence in {a mathematical formula}O, of the most appropriate matching relation for a number of abstraction hypotheses that can globally shape a minimal and exclusive cover of IP.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The observation procedure of the generated pattern is denoted as {a mathematical formula}Tw_delin(), and may be any of the methods described in the literature for the delineation of T waves, such as in [26].In addition to the {a mathematical formula}Pwave pattern generated by {a mathematical formula}Gw and detailed in Example 3.4, {a mathematical formula}GN and {a mathematical formula}GTw generate the following abstraction patterns:{a mathematical formula}Finally, let {a mathematical formula}O={o1wave= 〈 qwave, ∅ ,0.300,0.403 〉 ,o2wave= 〈 qwave, ∅ ,0.463, {a mathematical formula}0.549 〉 ,oPw= 〈 qPw, ∅ ,0.300,0.403 〉 ,oQRS= 〈 qQRS, ∅ ,0.463,0.549 〉 } be a set of initial observations including a P wave and a QRS complex abstracting two wave observations located at specific time points.Given this interpretation problem, Fig.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">The result of ABDUCE() is a set of interpretations {a mathematical formula}I ′ , each one adding a new abstraction hypothesis with respect to the parent interpretation I.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Then, for each grammar, each production including the corresponding observable {a mathematical formula}q(oi) (line 4) initializes an abstraction pattern with a single finding of this observable (line 5), and a new hypothesis is conjectured with a matching relation involving both the observation under focus and the finding (line 6).</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">A list structure {a mathematical formula}L Ħ and two additional variables {a mathematical formula}B Ħ and {a mathematical formula}E Ħ are initialized to trace the sequence of productions used to generate the findings in the abstraction pattern; these will play an important role in subsequent reasoning steps (line 7).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">This reasoning mode is applied when the attention is focused on an observation {a mathematical formula}oh previously conjectured as part of an abstraction hypothesis Ħ (see Algorithm 4).</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The DEDUCE() function takes the evidence that has led to conjecture {a mathematical formula}oh and tries to extend it with new findings which can be expected, i.e., deduced, from the abstraction grammar {a mathematical formula}Gh used to guess the observation.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Since the first finding leading to conjecture {a mathematical formula}oh does not necessarily appear at the beginning of the grammar description, the corresponding abstraction pattern will not, in general, be generated incrementally from the first production of the grammar.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">6 illustrates the outcome of this reasoning process and the uncertainty in the temporal limits of the predicted finding, which is now focused on in the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I2.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">The SUBSUME() function explores the set of observations {a mathematical formula}O and selects those consistent with the constraints on the finding in the focus of attention (line 3), expanding the matching relation of the corresponding hypothesis in different descendant interpretations (line 4).</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Constraint solving assigns the value of {a mathematical formula}tTwb, {a mathematical formula}tTwe and {a mathematical formula}tNe, so the result is a cover of the initial interpretation problem in which all the hypotheses have a necessary and sufficient set of evidence.</a>
