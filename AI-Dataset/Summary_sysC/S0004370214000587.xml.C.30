<a href="#1" id="1">The partitioning scheme P extracts a set of images {a mathematical formula}bi from the target image B.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The next step of the algorithm is to perform a systematic examination of the source image A for fragments of A that can be said to best match a particular image {a mathematical formula}bi.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One method for solving this puzzle is this: from this set of candidates, we may form the fractal representations from the fractal encoding of the transformation of each candidate image X in terms of image C.{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} This provides a set of possible transformations, which we shall label Ω , from which to seek the most analogous transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ and thereby find which candidate image was responsible for it.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this example, the problem is to determine for which of the candidate images the transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ is made most analogous to transformation T. We first will represent T as a fractal representation, and then generate a set of candidate transformations Ω as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To solve a Raven's problem, one must select the image from the set of possible answers for which the similarity to each of the problem's relationships is maximal.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For our example, this involves the calculation of a set of similarity values {a mathematical formula} Θ i for each answer {a mathematical formula}Ai:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}S(X,Y) is the Tversky similarity between two sets X and Y, and {a mathematical formula}H(Ai) and {a mathematical formula}V(Ai) denote the relationship formed when the answer image {a mathematical formula}Ai is included.</a>
