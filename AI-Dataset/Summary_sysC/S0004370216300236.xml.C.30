<a href="#0" id="0">Where do the hypothesised types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j ⁎ come from?</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our definition of correctness is with respect to the type distribution ϒ : beliefs are said to be correct if they assign the same probabilities to true types as ϒ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, recall from Section 3.2 that posterior beliefs of the form (1) assume independence of player types.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">That is, they assume that the type distribution ϒ can be represented as a product of n independent factors {a mathematical formula} ϒ j (one for each player), such that {a mathematical formula} ϒ ( Θ )= ∏ j ϒ j( Θ j).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, in the following, unless states otherwise, we assume that ϒ satisfies this independence property.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Player 1 is controlled by HBA using a sum posterior while player 2 has two types, {a mathematical formula} Θ 2+={ Θ A, Θ AB}, which are assigned by a pure type distribution ϒ with {a mathematical formula} ϒ ( Θ A)=1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The type {a mathematical formula} Θ A always chooses action A while {a mathematical formula} Θ AB chooses actions A and B with equal probability.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">While the product posterior converges to the correct probabilities ϒ , the sum posterior converges to probabilities {a mathematical formula} 〈 23,13 〉 , which is incorrect.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since the types {a mathematical formula} Θ A and {a mathematical formula} Θ B always choose different actions and are completely deterministic (i.e.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Players 2 and 3 each have two types, {a mathematical formula} Θ 2+= Θ 3+={ Θ A, Θ B}, which are defined as in Example 2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The type distribution ϒ chooses types with probabilities {a mathematical formula} ϒ ( Θ A, Θ B)= ϒ ( Θ B, Θ A)=0.5 and {a mathematical formula} ϒ ( Θ A, Θ A)= ϒ ( Θ B, Θ B)=0.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In other words, player 2 can never have the same type as player 3.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">From the perspective of HBA, each type (and hence action) is chosen with equal probability for both players.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We used HBA to control player 1 and a fixed type in each play to control player 2, which was included in the set of hypothesised types {a mathematical formula} Θ 2 ⁎ provided to HBA (discussed in detail in Section 5.6).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We used three different methods to automatically generate parameterised sets of types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ for any given game.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We specified a total of 10 different methods to automatically compute prior beliefs {a mathematical formula}Pj for a given set of types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ :</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In each play, we randomly generated 9 unique types and provided them to HBA along with the true type of player 2, such that {a mathematical formula}| Θ 2 ⁎ |=10.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">(That is, each play had a pure type distribution; cf.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Section 3.1) Thus, the true type of player 2 was always included in the set of hypothesised types {a mathematical formula} Θ 2 ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Consider a SBG with two players and actions L and R. Player 1 is controlled by HBA while player 2 has a single type, {a mathematical formula} Θ LR, which chooses L,R,L,R, etc.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">HBA is provided with hypothesised types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ={ Θ R ⁎ , Θ LRR ⁎ }, where {a mathematical formula} Θ R ⁎ always chooses R while {a mathematical formula} Θ LRR ⁎ chooses L,R,R,L,R,R etc.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Both hypothesised types are incorrect in the sense that they predict player 2's actions in only ≈ 50% of the game.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In our analysis, we will sometimes assume that the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical:</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We can show that Property 1 holds if the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i with positive expected payoff in X.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">We can show that Property 2 holds if the type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i which lead to states into which X may get as well.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">We can show that Property 3 holds if the hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and if Y only chooses actions for player i which X might have chosen as well.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">If{a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ are uncritical and{a mathematical formula}then</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">In this regard, we note that any combination of beliefs Pr and types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ can be described as a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j ⁎ of the form{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Therefore, to simplify the notation in this section, we will generally assume a single hypothesised type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j and a single true type {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ∈ Θ j.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Note that this means that our method can be applied to the combination of beliefs and hypothesised types, as well as to individual types in {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
