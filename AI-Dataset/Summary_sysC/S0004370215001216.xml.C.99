<a href="#0" id="0">In fact, we have a more accurate relationship between these sets: Informally, any solution accepted by some {a mathematical formula}rlex Σ constraint and rejected by the corresponding {a mathematical formula}lex Σ constraint has to have at least two equal components, namely {a mathematical formula}x Σ ˆ =x Σ ˆ Σ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We define the set of vectors that have at least two equal components as {a mathematical formula}H:={x ∈ Rn: ∃ (i,j),i ≠ j ∧ xi=xj}, and note that {a mathematical formula}volH=0 since it is only composed of (hyper)planes, i.e., flat sets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We therefore see that {a mathematical formula}lex Σ and {a mathematical formula}rlex Σ solution sets have the same hypervolume, which is proved in the following proposition.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If the set of rlex imposes a total order on the variables, they are SBCs in the whole domain including the set of frontier points, which coincides with H (because in this case rlex and lex are equivalent) and, thus, the set in b) is not empty.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{sup:10} The space they delimit however strictly contains {a mathematical formula}L and it has a volume strictly larger than {a mathematical formula}R, making {a mathematical formula}hlex Δ a weaker (P)SBC than both lex and rlex.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Again, and similarly to most proposed lex encodings, the first and foremost reason why such encodings are not appropriate in the continuous context is that they come in factorial number with respect to the number of variables in the worst case, without an efficient (poly-time) method for generating them, and involve all the variables implied in the symmetry in a formula much more complex than rlex constraints.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These are the reasons why we consider rlex the most appropriate PSBCs in the continuous context.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A counter-productive performance occur for only 1 run out of the 68 experiments, the instance of problem Eiger at dimension {a mathematical formula}n=100, and the loss in solving time is {a mathematical formula}2% of 22.3 s, i.e., 0.3 s. A more detailed look at this problem reveals it has only a cyclic symmetry group (order n), very simple binary quadratic constraints and only two fully frontier solutions (see Section 5.2.1 for a detailed analysis of the influence of these features).</a>
