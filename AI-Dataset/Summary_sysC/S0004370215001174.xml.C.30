<a href="#0" id="0">We show how the definition of a proper scoring system allows for desired functionalities to be related to tasks and how the resulting analysis fuels subsequent changes to achieve general and robust solutions implemented by the teams.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our results show not only the steadily increasing complexity of the tasks that RoboCup@Home robots can solve but also the increased performance for all of the functionalities addressed in the competition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We believe that the methodology used in RoboCup@Home for evaluating competition advances and for stimulating changes can be applied and extended to other robotic competitions as well as to multi-year research projects involving Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this article, we are mainly interested in analyzing the results of competitions over the years.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, we focus on how this analysis has been carried out in the last years within the RoboCup@Home competition, which is the largest competition for domestic and service robots.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The evaluation of a competition's effectiveness based on the scores of the teams over the years is important for better fueling the competition and the novel approach introduced in RoboCup@Home for addressing this issue is the main contribution of this article.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Although our analysis reported in this article is specific to the RoboCup@Home competition, we believe that its principles can be applied both to other existing competitions and to new ones, and it could even be used for evaluating multi-year projects or challenges in AI and robotics where some tasks are repeated and changed over the years.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The evaluation of a competition's effectiveness based on the team scores is thus a novel approach introduced in RoboCup@Home and is the main contribution of this article.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Moreover, the evaluation methodology applied in RoboCup@Home might help both existing competitions and new ones as well as multi-year projects or challenges in AI and robotics where some tasks are repeated and changed over the years.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">After the first two years of RoboCup@Home competitions (2006 â€“ 2007), we discussed how to evaluate the performances in terms of measuring the improvements demonstrated by the teams in the tests over the years.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The scoring system described above allows for analysis of the results of the teams in the different functionalities and can also be used to evaluate the progress of the entire competition, as explained in this section.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Our analysis aims at understanding the progress of the competitions through the years and at providing the Technical Committee with a tool to decide rule changes for the next year.</a>
