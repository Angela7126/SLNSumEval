<a href="#0" id="0">The theorem essentially says that, given a context structure {a mathematical formula}D and a clause system {a mathematical formula}S saturated under the {a mathematical formula}Hyper, {a mathematical formula}Pred, and {a mathematical formula}Succ rules, we can read off the consequences of the form {a mathematical formula}K ⊑ M from the sets {a mathematical formula}S(v) provided that {a mathematical formula}K ⊑ M is a query, the context v is complete (cf.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To ensure that each clause obtained by applying our consequence-based algorithm to {a mathematical formula}D is a logical consequence of {a mathematical formula}O, we require {a mathematical formula}D to be sound: in addition to the condition on {a mathematical formula} ∃ R.A-edges from Definition 8, the known literals in each context of {a mathematical formula}D must logically follow from the context's core — that is, {a mathematical formula}O ⊨ core(v) ⊑ L should hold for each context v in {a mathematical formula}D and each literal {a mathematical formula}L ∈ knw(v).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, assume that we modify the algorithm in two ways: (i) we explicitly maintain the mapping Μ from Theorem 26, and (ii) whenever the ∃ -rule introduces a new individual t, we immediately derive {a mathematical formula}L(t) for each literal {a mathematical formula}L ∈ knw( Μ (t)).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Throughout Appendix A, we fix a normalized {a mathematical formula}ALCI ontology {a mathematical formula}O, an admissible context structure {a mathematical formula}D= 〈 V,E,core, ≺ 〉 , and a clause system {a mathematical formula}S for {a mathematical formula}D such that no inference rule from Table 3 is applicable to {a mathematical formula}S; furthermore, we fix L to be the set of all literals that occur in {a mathematical formula}O, {a mathematical formula}D, or {a mathematical formula}S. We prove Theorem 6 by showing the following contrapositive claim: {a mathematical formula}O ⊭ K ⊑ M holds for each query {a mathematical formula}K ⊑ M for which a context {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V exists such that</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the rest of Appendix B, we fix a normalized {a mathematical formula}ALCI ontology {a mathematical formula}O, an admissible decomposition {a mathematical formula}D= 〈 V,E,core,knw,poss, ≺ , Θ 〉 of {a mathematical formula}O and an arbitrary finite set of queries, and a clause system {a mathematical formula}S for {a mathematical formula}D satisfying the preconditions of Theorem 37; furthermore, we fix L to be the set of all literals that occur in {a mathematical formula}O, {a mathematical formula}D, or {a mathematical formula}S. We prove Theorem 37 by constructing a pre-interpretation that satisfies {a mathematical formula}O but refutes the relevant queries.</a>
