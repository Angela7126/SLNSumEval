<a href="#0" id="0">This allows us to show, for instance, that System {a mathematical formula}A is sound and complete for the inference of arbitrary CI statements from sets of saturated CI statements relative to both the class of all binary probability measures and the class of all discrete probability measures.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A witness decomposition of a CI statement (Definition 9) is equivalent to the original statement for derivations under System {a mathematical formula}A (Proposition 10).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These results yield a normal form for derivations under System {a mathematical formula}A: first, from the given set of CI statements, derive a set of elementary CI statements from the given set of CI statements under System {a mathematical formula}G; then, from this set, derive a new set of elementary CI statements under System {a mathematical formula}E; and, finally, from this last set, derive the targeted CI statement under inference System {a mathematical formula}G. (Notice that System {a mathematical formula}E can be inferred from System {a mathematical formula}A.)</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Definition 23, Definition 27 for soundness and completeness of an inference system for the additive implication problem {a mathematical formula}(C1,C2)F ({a mathematical formula}C1 and {a mathematical formula}C2 are classes of CI statements and {a mathematical formula}F is a class of real-valued functions) can be adapted to the setting of probabilistic implication, provided {a mathematical formula}F is replaced by a class of discrete probability measures {a mathematical formula}P, and a-implication ({a mathematical formula} ⊨ a) is replaced by m-implication ({a mathematical formula} ⊨ m).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From Example 35, we may conclude that strong union is not sound for the probabilistic implication problem {a mathematical formula}(Call,Call)Pbin.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It only remains to show that System {a mathematical formula}G is complete for both probabilistic implication problems.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This is because System {a mathematical formula}G is complete for the probabilistic implication problem {a mathematical formula}(Csat,Call)P, where {a mathematical formula}P is an arbitrary class of probability measures, if and only if System {a mathematical formula}A is [41].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since System {a mathematical formula}A is complete but not sound for the probabilistic implication problem (Theorem 40), {a mathematical formula}C ⊢ c or, equivalently, {a mathematical formula}L(c) ⊆ L(C) (Theorem 11) is necessary but not sufficient for {a mathematical formula}C ⊨ Pmc, not all relevant statements associated with {a mathematical formula}C need be probabilistically implied by {a mathematical formula}C. By Proposition 42, however, there is a subset of {a mathematical formula}R(C) that is probabilistically equivalent to {a mathematical formula}C.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">There is no point in considering those not relevant to {a mathematical formula}C, however, as a careful examination of the proof reveals that their coefficients in the sum are necessarily 0, and, therefore, they cannot contribute to the solutions of the above equation.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For {a mathematical formula}|S|=4 – 10, we randomly generated 1000 sets each consisting of 3 elementary CI statements, then constructed the set of relevant CI statements and the constraint matrix A for each set of antecedents, and finally ran the validation algorithm with each of the possibly implied elementary CI statements as a consequence.</a>
