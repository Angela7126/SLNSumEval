<a href="#0" id="0">An aggregation rule is a function {a mathematical formula}F:(2V×V)n → 2V×V, mapping any given profile of individual graphs into a single graph.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A representative-voter rule is an aggregation rule F that is such that for every profile E there exists an individual {a mathematical formula}i ⋆ ∈ N such that {a mathematical formula}F(E)=Ei ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The dictatorship of individual {a mathematical formula}i ⋆ ∈ N is the aggregation rule {a mathematical formula}Fi ⋆ with {a mathematical formula}Fi ⋆ :E ↦ Ei ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the right-to-left direction, observe that, to accept a given edge {a mathematical formula}(x,y) in the collective graph, an IIE aggregation rule will only look at the set of individuals i such that {a mathematical formula}xEiy.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Sometimes we are only going to be interested in the properties of an aggregation rule as far as the nonreflexive edges {a mathematical formula}e=(x,y) with {a mathematical formula}x ≠ y are concerned.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">An aggregation rule F is called collectively rational with respect to a graph property P if {a mathematical formula}F(E) satisfies P whenever all of the individual graphs in {a mathematical formula}E=(E1, … ,En) do.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, an aggregation rule that is both IIE and neutral can be fully described in terms of a single set {a mathematical formula}W of winning coalitions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Neutrality LemmaFor{a mathematical formula}|V| ⩾ 3, any unanimous, grounded, and IIE aggregation rule that is collectively rational with respect to a contagious graph property must be NR-neutral.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We are first going to establish a generic result for collective rationality with respect to {a mathematical formula}xy/zw-contagiousness.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Take any graph property P that is {a mathematical formula}xy/zw-contagious and take any aggregation rule F that is unanimous, grounded, IIE, and collectively rational with respect to P. Let {a mathematical formula}{We}e ∈ V×V be the family of winning coalitions associated with F. We want to show that {a mathematical formula}W(x,y) ⊆ W(z,w).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Now consider the collective graph {a mathematical formula}F(E).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We now know that any Arrovian aggregation rule F that is collectively rational with respect to some contagious graph property P can be fully described in terms of a single family {a mathematical formula}W of winning coalitions, at least as far as F's behaviour on nonreflexive edges is concerned.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As F is collectively rational with respect to P, we get {a mathematical formula}F(E) ∈ P[S+,S − ].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As F is collectively rational with respect to P, we thus also get {a mathematical formula}e3 ∈ F(E).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Thus, due to unanimity, all of the edges in {a mathematical formula}S+ must be part of the collective graph {a mathematical formula}F(E).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Thus, as F is collectively rational with respect to P, we get {a mathematical formula}F(E) ∈ P[S+,S − ].</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Thus, as F is collectively rational with respect to transitivity, so does {a mathematical formula}(x,z).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">An aggregation rule F is frame collectively rational with respect to a modal integrity constraint Φ if {a mathematical formula} 〈 V,Ei 〉 ⊨ Φ for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N implies {a mathematical formula} 〈 V,F(E) 〉 ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">An aggregation rule F is model collectively rational with respect to a modal integrity constraint Φ if for every valuation {a mathematical formula}Val: Φ → 2V we have {a mathematical formula} 〈 〈 V,Ei 〉 ,Val 〉 ⊨ Φ for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N implying {a mathematical formula} 〈 〈 V,F(E) 〉 ,Val 〉 ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">But note that the majority rule is not model collectively rational with respect to the same formula {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">For example, the aggregation rule F that returns the full graph in case all individual graphs satisfy {a mathematical formula} ◇ (p ∨ ¬p), and the empty graph otherwise, is model collectively rational but not world collectively rational.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Any unanimous aggregation rule is frame collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Any neutral aggregation rule is frame collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula}p → □ ◇ p.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">If we aggregate using {a mathematical formula}F ∩ , we obtain a collective graph with a single edge {a mathematical formula}(x,y).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The best we can say is that all oligarchic rules are frame collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula} ◇ ◇ p → ◇ p.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Hence, the intersection rule is not model collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula} ◇ ◇ p → ◇ p.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Recall that a representative-voter rule is an aggregation rule F that is such that for every profile E there exists an individual {a mathematical formula}i ⋆ ∈ N such that {a mathematical formula}F(E)=Ei ⋆ (see Definition 7).</a>
