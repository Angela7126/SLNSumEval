<a href="#0" id="0">We want to point out that although we consider cartographic principles for geographic maps, our research goal has the following peculiarities: (i) maps have to be suitable for usage not only by humans but also by machines; (ii) traditional cartography builds upon the notion of Euclidean space, while in our context, the space being mapped, that is the Web, is purely relational; (iii) traditional cartography uses the notion of scale to abstract information on a map; the scale gives all points equal importance.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The k-map of Γ is the good map generated by the set of distinguished nodes {a mathematical formula}{v ∈ V Γ :f(v) ≥ k}, where {a mathematical formula}f:V Γ → R is a selective function measuring a specific property of the nodes in Γ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, {a mathematical formula} Γ .N is the set containing the starting node from which the evaluation of an expression begins and the set of ending nodes, that is, the expression endpoints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A graph region Γ captures the specification given via a navigational expression e starting from a single node of the graph where {a mathematical formula} Γ .E Γ and {a mathematical formula} Γ .V Γ are edges and nodes navigated during the evaluation of e. The need to start from a node (or a set of nodes) is motivated by the fact that our framework is meant to be used on the Web, and thus, it is infeasible to start the evaluation of a navigational expression from all nodes of the Web graph (assuming one can enumerate all of them).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that the space required to evaluate an {a mathematical formula}L expression and build the (k-)map of the corresponding region is proportional to the time, since only relevant nodes are visited.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The advantage of using the algebra is to avoid having to compute the good map from scratch and obtain it without looking at the regions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As an example, in the intersection we have the nodes G. Peano and A. Tarski, which means that they both belong to the influence networks of SK and TBL.</a>
