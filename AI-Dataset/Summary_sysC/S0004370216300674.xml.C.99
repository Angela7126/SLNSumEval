<a href="#0" id="0">We assume a bipartite graph {a mathematical formula}G ′ ∼ S ′ and show that lacking any one such condition implies that {a mathematical formula}S ′ cannot be complete or cannot be a structure at all.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First, it is easy to see that when condition (iii) does not hold for {a mathematical formula}G ′ then a structure {a mathematical formula}S ′ with {a mathematical formula}G ′ ∼ S ′ cannot be complete.Now suppose condition (ii) does not for {a mathematical formula}G ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is, there is some {a mathematical formula}f ∈ V1 ′ that has incidence with some {a mathematical formula}x ∈ V2 ∖ V2 ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus we have {a mathematical formula}V1 ′ ↦ E ′ and {a mathematical formula}V2 ′ ↦ V ′ but {a mathematical formula} ⋃ f ∈ E ′ Vars(f) ≠ V ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore either {a mathematical formula}S ′ does not satisfy Definition 1 or we cannot actually have {a mathematical formula}G ′ ∼ S ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">↯ .Finally, consider that {a mathematical formula}G ′ is not structural (Definition 10).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">That is, there is some {a mathematical formula}V1 ″ ⊆ V1 ′ such that no connected bipartite subgraph {a mathematical formula}G ″ (V1 ″ ∪ V2 ″ ,E ″ ) exists in {a mathematical formula}G ′ with {a mathematical formula}|V1 ″ | ≤ |V2 ″ |.</a>
