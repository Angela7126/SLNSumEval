<a href="#0" id="0">In each step (or iteration) of the algorithm an agent sends its assignment to all its neighbors in the constraint graph and receives the assignments of all its neighbors.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proposed methods find solutions of higher quality than state-of-the-art algorithms when implemented within the anytime local search framework.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In each step of the algorithm an agent sends its assignment to all its neighbors in the constraint network and receives the assignments of all its neighbors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In our work, we consider synchronous local search algorithms that perform in an asynchronous environment; thus, agents must exchange messages with all neighbors in every step of the algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The state of an agent in each step includes its value assignment and the local cost, which is the sum of costs incurred according to constraints with the value assignments of its neighbors.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In each step of the algorithm an agent sends its value assignment to all its neighbors in the constraint network and receives the value assignment of all its neighbors.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">When the local search algorithm is terminated, the agents must perform another h steps in which they do not replace their assignment to make sure that all the agents are aware of the same index of the best step (lines 31 â€“ 36).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In step {a mathematical formula}i+h, the root agent will receive these costs and it will be able to add its own private cost for step i to the sum of the costs of all the other agents in the DCOP in step i.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, after {a mathematical formula}m+h steps, the root agent holds the index of the step with the best state among the first m steps and, according to Lemma 2, at the end of the algorithm run, all agents hold the value assignment of the step that was found by the root to be the best.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, we note that in the proposed framework, in order to get the best state among m steps the algorithm needs to run for {a mathematical formula}m+2h steps.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In standard local search algorithms (such as DSA and DBA), agents at each step send at least one message to each of their neighbors.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The standard use of local search algorithms for DisCSPs and DCOPs prior to the proposal of the ALS_DCOP framework includes running an algorithm for some number of steps (m) and reporting the complete assignment (solution) held by the agents after the mth step.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Our next set of experiments compared the performance of local search algorithms on sparse, unstructured random DCOPs with constraint density {a mathematical formula}p1=0.1.</a>
