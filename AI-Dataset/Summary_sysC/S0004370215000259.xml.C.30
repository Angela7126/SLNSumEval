<a href="#1" id="1">• The virtual player uses Question Answering over Wikipedia and DBpedia knowledge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">• We performed experiments on the Italian and the English version of the game.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">• The virtual player outperforms human players to correctly answer to questions of the game.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">• The virtual player outperforms human players to play real games both in terms of level of the game reached and average income.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The architecture of the virtual player, the details of the QA and AS modules, and the decision making strategy adopted to play the game are provided in Sections 4 Virtual player architecture, 5 Question answering, 6 Answer scoring, 7 Decision making.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Answer Scoring: leverages the list of text passages extracted from the Question Answering module and adopts several criteria to assign a score to each of the four possible answers to a question.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Decision Making: takes the final decision whether answering to a question or retiring from the game by considering the current level of the game, the available lifelines, and the score computed for each possible answer by the Answer Scoring.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">According to the current level of difficulty of the game, the Game Manager selects a question along with the four possible answers, which are then passed to the Question Answering module.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This module exploits the knowledge contained in Wikipedia and DBpedia to select a ranked list of passages of text that likely contain the correct answer to the question.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">These passages are processed by the Answer Scoring, which implements a set of heuristics to come up with a score for each possible answer to the question.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Finally, the Decision Making module decides to provide a specific answer or to retire from the game, by taking into account the scores of the candidate answers, the available lifelines and the current level of the game.</a>
