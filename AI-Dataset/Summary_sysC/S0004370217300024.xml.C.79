<a href="#0" id="0">A possibility result establishes that every aggregation rule belonging to a certain class of rules (typically defined in terms of certain axioms) is collectively rational with respect to all graph properties that satisfy a certain meta-property.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An impossibility result, on the other hand, establishes that it is impossible to define an aggregation rule belonging to a certain class that would be collectively rational with respect to any graph property that meets a certain meta-property — or that the only such aggregation rules would be clearly very unattractive for other reasons.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We are sometimes going to denote the outcome {a mathematical formula}F(E) obtained when applying an aggregation rule F to a profile E simply as E and refer to it as the collective graph.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The first such axiom is an independence condition that requires that the decision of whether or not a given edge e should be part of the collective graph should only depend on which of the individual graphs include e. This corresponds to well-known axioms in preference and judgment aggregation [5], [17].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In social choice theory, an impossibility theorem states that it is not possible to devise an aggregation rule that satisfies certain axioms and that is also collectively rational with respect to a certain combination of properties of the structures being aggregated (which in our case are graphs).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We now know that any Arrovian aggregation rule F that is collectively rational with respect to some contagious graph property P can be fully described in terms of a single family {a mathematical formula}W of winning coalitions, at least as far as F's behaviour on nonreflexive edges is concerned.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our Theorem 16 is related to generalisations of Arrow's Theorem to judgment aggregation [51], [14], particularly in the formulation due to Dokow and Holzman [14], who model sets of judgments (on m issues) as binary vectors in some subspace of {a mathematical formula}{0,1}m. It is possible to embed graph aggregation into this form of judgment aggregation, by adapting the well-known approach for embedding preference aggregation into judgment aggregation [51], [14], [16].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For instance, it is well-known that {a mathematical formula}G= 〈 V,E 〉 is reflexive (i.e., E is a reflexive relation on V) if and only if the formula {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p is valid on G. To see this, consider a reflexive graph: by reflexivity we know that {a mathematical formula}x ∈ E(x) and, hence, whenever p is set to true in world x, x can “ see ” a world where p is true, namely itself, making ◇ p true.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In our discussion of Example 11, we concluded that the majority rule is not collectively rational with respect to seriality, which in the terminology of Definition 26 is expressed as the majority rule not being frame collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula} ◇ (p ∨ ¬p), a modal formula that corresponds to seriality.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">On the other hand, by Fact 5, the majority rule is frame collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p, corresponding to reflexivity.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">But note that the majority rule is not model collectively rational with respect to the same formula {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, the aggregation rule F that returns the full graph in case all individual graphs satisfy {a mathematical formula} ◇ (p ∨ ¬p), and the empty graph otherwise, is model collectively rational but not world collectively rational.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Moreover, Example 14 can be used to show the strict implication in item (ii), since it concerns an aggregation rule that is frame collectively rational with respect to modal formula {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p but not model collectively rational with respect to the same formula.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Our (negative) impossibility results of Section 3 were indeed proved for frame collective rationality and these results thus immediately extend also to the other two levels (in those cases where the graph property in question has a corresponding modal formula).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Unlike in Section 2.5, where we proved a number of simple possibility results for collective rationality at the level of frames for specific graph properties, the following results apply to all graph properties that can be expressed as modal integrity constraints meeting certain syntactic restrictions.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Recall that a representative-voter rule is an aggregation rule F that is such that for every profile E there exists an individual {a mathematical formula}i ⋆ ∈ N such that {a mathematical formula}F(E)=Ei ⋆ (see Definition 7).</a>
