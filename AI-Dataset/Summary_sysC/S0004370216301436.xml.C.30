<a href="#0" id="0">Alors exploits the {a mathematical formula}(n,m) collaborative filtering matrix {a mathematical formula}M reporting the domain-dependent performance {a mathematical formula}Mi,j of the j-th algorithm for the i-th problem instance for a fraction of the {a mathematical formula}(i,j) pairs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the following, it is assumed that the best performance corresponds to the lowest value, associated to rank 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Besides the performance matrix, Alors will also exploit the rank matrix M, where {a mathematical formula}Mi,j reports the rank of the j-th algorithm on the i-th problem instance (Table 1).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Alors also exploits – for its cold-start functionality only – the {a mathematical formula}(n,d) matrix X, yielding the initial d-dimensional representation of the problem instances.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The cold start (CS) functionality achieves algorithm selection for a new problem instance, for which the latent representation cannot be determined from the CF matrix by construction.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Alors exploits the known problem instances to learn the latent representation from the initial representation as follows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Each problem instance defines a training example {a mathematical formula}(xi,Ui).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From the training set{a mathematical formula} a mapping Φ ({a mathematical formula} Φ :Rd ↦ Rk) is learned using random forests.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{sup:4} For each new problem instance with initial representation x, the associated latent representation {a mathematical formula}Ux is approximated as {a mathematical formula} Φ (x).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The first indicator, noted cf, measures the performance of algorithm selection on known problem instances based on an excerpt of matrix {a mathematical formula}M. After the above discussion, the cf performance reflects the quality of the set of problem instances, called benchmark in the following.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The second performance indicator, noted cs, measures the quality of algorithm selection for new problem instances.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The sensitivity of both performances with respect to the incompleteness rate p of the {a mathematical formula}M matrix and the number k of latent factors is studied on two real-world benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">An artificial problem is also defined to investigate and compare Alors and Matchbox.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">using the latent factors to fill-in matrix {a mathematical formula}Mp and determining the selected algorithm for each i-th problem instance;</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The rank of the single best baseline is circa 60 – with the caveat that the statistical significance of the differences between the algorithm performances is not available.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The representativity of the problem instances is very good as Alors very significantly outperforms the single best baseline for incompleteness rate {a mathematical formula}p<=90%.</a>
