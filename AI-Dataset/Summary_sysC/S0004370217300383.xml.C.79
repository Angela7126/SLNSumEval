<a href="#0" id="0">To formulate a principle that subsumes a;; three cases, therefore, requires the fairly abstract concept of a history, a function from time to regions of space, that can move around (needed for Fact 1, Fact 3) but is not tied to a physical object (needed for Fact 2, Fact 3).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The qualitative theory of physics developed here is divided into six parts: general physical laws; basic laws of the agent's motion and manipulation; a theory of open containers; a theory of stability and falling; frame axioms, which limit the kinds of changes that occur; and specialized axioms for specific actions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We do not need comparable physical axioms for closed containers; the fact that an object necessarily remains in a closed container is a consequence of the general physical laws, that objects move continuously and do not overlap, together with spatio-temporal theorems.</a>
