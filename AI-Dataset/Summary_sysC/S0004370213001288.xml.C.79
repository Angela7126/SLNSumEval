<a href="#0" id="0">Also, we will prove some results that state that “ PROBLEM for ELECTION-SYSTEM over log-maverick-SP societies is in P. ” This is a shorthand for the claim that for each function f (that is computable in time polynomial in the size of the input — which is roughly {a mathematical formula} ‖ V ‖ ‖ C ‖ log ‖ C ‖ for the election {a mathematical formula}(C,V) itself plus whatever space is taken by other parameters — and to avoid possible technical problems, we should assume f is nondecreasing) whose value is {a mathematical formula}O(log(ProblemInputSize)), it holds that “ PROBLEM for ELECTION-SYSTEM over f-maverick-SP societies is in P, ” where the argument to f is the input size of the problem.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So if our problem were CCWM for plurality elections over {a mathematical formula}PerceptionFlip2-SP societies, then this input would not be a part of the problem under study, and any correct algorithm would need to reject on that input.Finally, this example shows rather dramatically why it matters that in our notion each voter can have his or her own distortions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Suppose we wanted to define a different nearness notion, say “ a SharedDelusion{a mathematical formula}k-SP society, ” defined by there having to be some linear order, {a mathematical formula}L ′ , that is at most k (sequential) swaps of adjacent candidates away from the input societal order, and such that the vote set is single-peaked with respect to {a mathematical formula}L ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Collection V contains the following {a mathematical formula}N+(3k+2)N voters (we specify up to {a mathematical formula}t+1 top candidates for each voter, sometimes — as in the case of the description of the societal axis — including sets of candidates in the preference orders without specifying their relative order; the reader can easily verify that it is possible to implement preference orders of the form given in a swoon-SP society).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For each t, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that given an instance of CCDV for t-approval elections finds a number s such that the minimal number of voters that we have to delete from our input election in order to ensure the preferred candidate ʼ s victory is between{a mathematical formula}12sand s.Let {a mathematical formula}E=(C,V) be our input election and let L be our given societal axis with respect to which E is a swoon-SP election.</a>
