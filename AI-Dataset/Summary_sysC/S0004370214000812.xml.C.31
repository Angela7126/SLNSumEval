<a href="#0" id="0">Said more intuitively, once the nodes in the most influential set S follow the behavior {a mathematical formula}xS prescribed to them by a desired stable outcome x achieving the goal of interest, they become collectively “ so influential ” that their behavior “ forces ” every other individual to a unique choice of behavior!</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our proposed concept of the most influential individuals is illustrated in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">1 with a very simple example.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A subtle aspect of diffusion models is that each node in the network behaves as an independent agent.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Any observed influence that a node's neighbors impose on the node is the result of the same node's “ rational ” or “ natural ” response to the neighbors' behavior.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, in many cases, it would be desirable that the solution to the most-influential-nodes problem leads us to a stable outcome of the system, in which each node's behavior is a best response to the neighbors' behavior.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, if we select a set of nodes with the goal of maximizing the spread of the new behavior, then some of the selected nodes may end up “ unhappy ” being the initial adopters of the new behavior, with respect to their neighbors' final behavior at the end of forward recursion.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, a selected node's best behavioral response could be not adopting the new behavior after all.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Therefore, for all individuals i and any possible behavior {a mathematical formula}x − i ∈ { − 1,1}n − 1 of the other individuals in the population, the best-response behavior{a mathematical formula}xi ⁎ of individual i to the behavior {a mathematical formula}x − i ⁎ of others satisfies{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Informally, “ positive influences ” lead an individual to adopt the behavior, while “ negative influences ” lead the individual to “ reject ” the behavior; the individual is indifferent if there is “ no influence. ” We formally characterize the stable outcomes of the system by the following notion of pure-strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE) of the corresponding general-influence game.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Definition 3.5</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We adopt general-influence games as the model of strategic behavior among the individuals.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">An example of a goal function g that captures the objective of achieving a specific stable outcome {a mathematical formula}x ⁎ ∈ NE(G) is {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ 1[x=x ⁎ ].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Another example that captures the objective of achieving a stable outcome with the largest number of individuals adopting the behavior 1 is {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ ∑ i=1nxi+12, or equivalently, {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ ∑ i=1nxi.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Note that both of the functions just presented ignore the set S. One alternative that does not is {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ ∑ i ∈ Stixi − ∑ i ∉ Stixi, where the {a mathematical formula}ti's reflect a weighted preference over individual nodes, thus capturing our interest in some “ weighted maximum set of adopters. ”</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Definition 3.7</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Linear-Influence GameIn a linear-influence game (LIG), the influence function of each individual i is defined as {a mathematical formula}fi(x − i) ≡ ∑ j ≠ iwjixj − bi where for any other individual j, {a mathematical formula}wji ∈ R is a weight parameter quantifying the “ influence factor ” that j has on i, and {a mathematical formula}bi ∈ R is a threshold parameter for i's level of “ tolerance ” for negative effects.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Yet, out of purely scientific curiosity and suggestions/feedback about our work, we present preliminary results based on a heuristic for the problem of most influential nodes in our context (i.e., LIGs) that we designed by adapting what is arguably the most popular and simple greedy-selection algorithm for identifying “ most influential ” nodes developed specifically for the cascade model of diffusion [49].</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The simplicity of the original algorithm in the diffusion context facilitates the adaptation to our context.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Note however that this adaptation is exclusive to a very specific instance of our general problem formulation: identifying “ most influential nodes ” with respect to the goal being maximizing the number of +1's in the PSNE (see Definition 3.6 in Section 3.2 for a definition and discussion of our problem formulation and the role that the “ objective function ” {a mathematical formula}g(.)</a>
