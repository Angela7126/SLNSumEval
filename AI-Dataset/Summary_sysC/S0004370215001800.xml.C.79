<a href="#0" id="0">We therefore think that the definition of an argument should exclude the kind of dependency shown by {a mathematical formula}a2; in this way we will in §4 follow others such as [29], who have defined arguments so as to eliminate such dependency.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is also true that, where some argument {a mathematical formula}a is support-minimal, it does not need to be rule-minimal — and so does not have to correspond directly to an argument graph.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, it is appropriate to define a relation of attack between argument graphs, {a mathematical formula}G ⇝ G ′ , allowing the sentence in G that is contrary of the attacked assumption in {a mathematical formula}G ′ to feature anywhere in G. This contrasts with the definition of attack in tree-based ABA, in which only the claim — i.e., the root — of the argument is relevant.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As shown above, for an argument graph G there may in general be several maximally rule-consistent {a mathematical formula}R such that {a mathematical formula}rules(G) ⊆ R.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Any argument graph characteristic function{a mathematical formula}fRhas a least fixed point equal to{a mathematical formula}fR Ω ( ◊ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Evidently if G is an argument graph then there is some {a mathematical formula}fR such that {a mathematical formula}rules(G) ⊆ R; we therefore just need to show that if {a mathematical formula}G ⊆ fR(G) for some such function, then where {a mathematical formula}rules(G) ⊆ R ′ for some {a mathematical formula}fR ′ , we have {a mathematical formula}G ⊆ fR ′ (G).Suppose for contradiction that there is {a mathematical formula}R ′ such that {a mathematical formula}G ⊈ fR ′ (G).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Suppose there is such a {a mathematical formula}G ′ , for contradiction, and let {a mathematical formula}fR ′ be such that {a mathematical formula}rules(G ′ ) ⊆ R ′ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By the definition of complete argument graph, and the fact that {a mathematical formula}rules(G) ⊆ rules(G ′ ), it must be that {a mathematical formula}G=fR ′ (G).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that this definition implies that, if O is an argument graph set and {a mathematical formula}O= ∅ , then {a mathematical formula}u(O)= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">newgrph takes a sentence {a mathematical formula}s ∈ L and forms a new potential argument graph in which s is unmarked.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For A2, again, it is plain that, in the proponent case (1), all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ u(Pi) must eventually be selected and treated according to Definition 5.5 — intuitively, all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ u(Pi) are pending proof, and if the potential argument graph is to become an actual argument graph, everything the proponent needs to support or defend must be proved.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">An ABA framework only admits the possibility of circular arguments if it is not p-acyclic; this notion is defined in [14], and the definition is equivalent to: Let the dependency graph of{a mathematical formula}(L,R,A,ss ‾ ) be the directed graph whose nodes are {a mathematical formula}L ∖ A and where there is a directed edge {a mathematical formula}(s,s ′ ) iff there is a rule {a mathematical formula}s ← B ∈ R such that {a mathematical formula}s ′ ∈ B.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This is to be expected: there is a single grounded extension in the case of standard, tree-based semantics for {a mathematical formula}(L,R,A,ss ‾ ), of which the set of arguments found by proxdd in a grounded dispute derivation must be an admissible subset; yet there can often be many grounded argument graphs, giving rise to a larger number of solutions for the latter.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">It might be thought that the explanation for this is the fact that, as {a mathematical formula}|L| gets larger without any other parameters being affected, the likelihood increases that sentences in {a mathematical formula}v(Pi), at any stage of an X-graph-DS, will not be the head of a rule — and so that as {a mathematical formula}|L| increases the number of admissible argument graphs containing s must diminish.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This conforms to expectation, in that as the number of rules per head increases, it is likely that the number of possible argument graphs and arguments to be explored, when a given {a mathematical formula}s ∈ L is chosen, will naturally increase.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Incorporating this into the definition of a grn-graph-DD allows us to prove the completeness of our procedures in Theorem 5.12; the adaptation is a matter of paying attention to the internal structure of arguments, so that the {a mathematical formula}Gi is defined over sentences instead of arguments.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Any argument graph characteristic function {a mathematical formula}fR has a least fixed point equal to {a mathematical formula}fR Ω ( ◊ ).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">there is a focused argument graph G, with{a mathematical formula}claim(a)=claim(G)and{a mathematical formula}support(G) ⊆ support(a);if G is a graphical conversion of some{a mathematical formula}a ′ such that{a mathematical formula}reduce(a,a ′ ), then G is a graphical conversion of{a mathematical formula}a(cf.Definition 4.5for the notion of graphical conversion).We now prove the parts i – iii of</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Let {a mathematical formula}Gs be the focused argument graph whose claim is s, such that {a mathematical formula}rules(Gs) ⊆ R (this can easily be shown to exist), and let {a mathematical formula}G+ be {a mathematical formula}Gs ∪ fRi( ◊ ); {a mathematical formula}G+ is easily shown to be an argument graph.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Thirdly, we present the proof itself, the core of which is by induction.An argument graph dispute tree{a mathematical formula}T for {a mathematical formula}s ∈ L is defined as follows:</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">□ The acyclicity of {a mathematical formula}IT will be proved to correspond to the acyclicity of {a mathematical formula}Gi in the grn-graph-DD we will construct.In the remainder of the proof, we show that, given a grounded argument graph G, the dispute tree {a mathematical formula}T shown to exist in Lemma A.25 can be used to construct a grn-graph-DD for {a mathematical formula}s0.</a>
