<a href="#0" id="0">In this section, we present a second particular solution with RLMF.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We start by introducing an extended RLMF method in the transfer learning manner with flexible entity correspondences between the source and the target systems, and then present an active entity selection approach to constructing cross-system correspondences based on the extended RLMF.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section, we present the third solution based on PMF.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We start by introducing an extended PMF method in the transfer learning manner with partial entity correspondences between the source and the target systems, and then present an active entity correspondences construction approach accordingly.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">NoTransf with actively constructed correspondences (NoTransf ({a mathematical formula}x% corr)): to first apply active learning to construct cross-domain entity correspondences ({a mathematical formula}x% of all the available cross-system correspondences), and then align the source and target domain data to generate a unified item-user matrix.</a>
