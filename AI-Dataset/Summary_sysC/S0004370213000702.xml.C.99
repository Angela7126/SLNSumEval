<a href="#0" id="0">By Theorem 10 and Lemma 3, Σ -entailment between acyclic {a mathematical formula}ALC-TBoxes is {a mathematical formula}coNExpNP-hard when Σ is a concept signature.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It thus remains to note that we can use a small variation of the reduction from Σ -entailment to Σ -inseparability given in the proof of Lemma 3, replacing Σ -inseparability with checking self-contained modules.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In detail, let {a mathematical formula}T1,T2 be acyclic TBoxes and Σ a concept signature.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By our strengthened formulation of Theorem 10 (see comment before that theorem), we can assume that {a mathematical formula}T1 ∪ T2 is acyclic.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that we can also assume that {a mathematical formula} Σ =sig(T1) ∩ sig(T2).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">First, as in the proof of Lemma 3, we can assume that {a mathematical formula} Σ ⊇ sig(T1) ∩ sig(T2).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Now, since we can also add fresh inclusions of the form {a mathematical formula}A0 ⊑ A for {a mathematical formula}A ∈ Σ ∩ NC (and with {a mathematical formula}A0 fresh) to {a mathematical formula}T1 and {a mathematical formula}T2 we can assume that {a mathematical formula} Σ =sig(T1) ∩ sig(T2).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Set {a mathematical formula}M=T1, {a mathematical formula}T=T1 ∪ T2, and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ =sig(T1).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Then {a mathematical formula}T ∖ M contains no direct {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ ∪ sig(M)-dependency between concept and role names since Σ is a concept signature.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Now it can be verified that {a mathematical formula}T1 ⊨ Σ T2 iff {a mathematical formula}T1 ≡ sig(T1)T1 ∪ T2 iff {a mathematical formula}M ≡ Σ ′ ∪ sig(M)T iff {a mathematical formula}M is a self-contained {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ -module.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In fact, the only interesting equivalence is the first one, where we exploit that {a mathematical formula} Σ =sig(T1) ∩ sig(T2).The upper bound proofs are by reduction to Σ -inseparability with Σ a concept signature, for which corresponding upper bounds have been established in Theorem 14, Theorem 9.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Given{a mathematical formula}EL- or{a mathematical formula}ELI-TBoxes{a mathematical formula}T1and{a mathematical formula}T2and concept signatures Σ , it is{a mathematical formula}coNExpNP-complete to decide{a mathematical formula}T1 ≡ Σ T2.Containment in {a mathematical formula}coNExpNP follows from Theorem 9, which shows that the problem is in {a mathematical formula}coNExpNP even for {a mathematical formula}ALCI-TBoxes.Hardness is (essentially) proved by reduction of Σ -entailment for {a mathematical formula}ALC-TBoxes and concept signatures Σ , which is {a mathematical formula}coNExpNP-hard by Theorem 10.More precisely, for {a mathematical formula}ALC-TBoxes {a mathematical formula}T1 and {a mathematical formula}T2 and a set Σ of concept names, we construct {a mathematical formula}EL-TBoxes {a mathematical formula}T1 ′ ,T2 ′ and a signature {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ consisting of concept names only the following two statements are equivalent:</a>
