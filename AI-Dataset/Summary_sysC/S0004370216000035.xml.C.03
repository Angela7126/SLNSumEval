<a href="#3" id="3">The set of variables of a propositional formula {a mathematical formula}F are represented by {a mathematical formula}var(F).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}FP ∥ NP is the class of function problems that can be calculated by polynomial number of parallel calls to a SAT oracle in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}FNP//OptP[log]=FPNP[wit,log].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Definition 4 requires {a mathematical formula}P(R)=1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Minimal setLet P be a monotone predicate over a set {a mathematical formula}R, and let {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ R be such that {a mathematical formula}P(M)=1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">FMUS is the function problem of computing an MUS of {a mathematical formula}F.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">FBB is the function problem of computing the backbone of {a mathematical formula}F.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Hence, {a mathematical formula}{y} is a minimal set for the predicate and consequently {a mathematical formula}{x} is the backbone.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Further, for all predicates of forms {a mathematical formula}L and {a mathematical formula}B, a minimal set can be calculated by a logarithmic number of calls to a witness oracle.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For predicates of the form {a mathematical formula}P, it is shown that if there is only a unique minimal set, then this minimal set can also be calculated by a logarithmic number of calls to a witness oracle.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Predicates of form {a mathematical formula}P with more than one minimal set are investigated in Section 5.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The first result shows that minimal sets for predicates of form {a mathematical formula}L can be solved by a logarithmic number of calls to an NP witness-oracle.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Let {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ R be a minimal set of P and let {a mathematical formula}u ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Note also that there is no minimal set equal to {a mathematical formula}R for {a mathematical formula}k>1.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Hence {a mathematical formula}St has been discarded.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Proposition 7 lets us derive that a minimal set for a predicate of the form {a mathematical formula}P can be computed if the number of minimal set is bounded.</a>
