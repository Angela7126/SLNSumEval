<a href="#0" id="0">This paper presents a meta-objective optimization approach, called Bi-Goal Evolution (BiGE), to deal with multi-objective optimization problems with many objectives.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In multi-objective optimization, it is generally observed that 1) the conflict between the proximity and diversity requirements is aggravated with the increase of the number of objectives and 2) the Pareto dominance loses its effectiveness for a high-dimensional space but works well on a low-dimensional space.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Inspired by these two observations, BiGE converts a given multi-objective optimization problem into a bi-goal (objective) optimization problem regarding proximity and diversity, and then handles it using the Pareto dominance relation in this bi-goal domain.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Implemented with estimation methods of individuals' performance and the classic Pareto nondominated sorting procedure, BiGE divides individuals into different nondominated layers and attempts to put well-converged and well-distributed individuals into the first few layers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From a series of extensive experiments on four groups of well-defined continuous and combinatorial optimization problems with 5, 10 and 15 objectives, BiGE has been found to be very competitive against five state-of-the-art algorithms in balancing proximity and diversity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The proposed approach is the first step towards a new way of addressing many-objective problems as well as indicating several important issues for future development of this type of algorithms.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This paper presents a meta-objective optimization approach, called Bi-Goal Evolution (BiGE), to deal with many-objective optimization problems.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Inspired by two observations: 1) the conflict between proximity and diversity requirements is aggravated with the increase of the number of objectives and 2) the Pareto dominance loses its effectiveness for a high-dimensional space but works well on a low-dimensional space, BiGE converts a given many-objective optimization problem into a bi-goal (objective) optimization problem regarding individuals' proximity and crowding degree, and then handles it using Pareto dominance in this bi-goal domain.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A clear difference of BiGE from these AR-based algorithms is that BiGE uses the idea of Pareto dominance to deal with proximity and diversity.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This could be well suited to many-objective optimization where the conflict between proximity and diversity goals is more serious than that in bi- or tri-objective optimization.</a>
