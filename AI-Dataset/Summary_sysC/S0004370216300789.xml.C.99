<a href="#0" id="0">The outcome {a mathematical formula}f( ⪰ ) is the social outcome defined by the social choice rule f. Mechanism design is concerned with the problem of constructing a mechanism — a strategic game form — which implements a social choice rule assuming a specific rational behaviour of the agents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given this observation, a lower bound of {a mathematical formula} Σ 2P=NPNP seems intuitive for weak implementation (an existential problem: guess a strategy profile with specific properties and verify it against all deviations) and a lower bound of {a mathematical formula} Π 2P=coNPNP for strong implementation (a universal problem).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That our strong implementation problem is more difficult than its weak version, {a mathematical formula} Σ 3P-complete, stems from the fact that an additional normative system has to be guessed such that all Nash equilibria satisfy a specific property.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Program statesLet {a mathematical formula}F ⊆ Π be a set of facts and Τ be a set of transitions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The set of states reached from F by subsequent transitions from Τ , denoted by {a mathematical formula}gen( Τ ,F), is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Observe that {a mathematical formula}gen( Τ ,F) is finite when Τ is finite.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that Definition 18 can be applied as norm-based environment programs have the required ingredients such as an initial state {a mathematical formula}F0, a sets of actions for each agent, and a set of action profile specifications.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We now investigate the relation between the concurrent game structure {a mathematical formula}Mn that is generated by a norm-based environment program, and the concurrent game structure {a mathematical formula}M ′ that is generated by the corresponding environment program without norms (i.e., the same initial state, actions, and action specifications) which is then updated with the same norms.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Case{a mathematical formula}S ⁎ = ∅ .In that case we have that {a mathematical formula}o ′ (F ′ , Α → )=o(G, Α → ), where {a mathematical formula}o ′ (F ′ , Α → ) ⊆ Π h which is generated by {a mathematical formula}G → Α → o ′ (F ′ , Α → ) ∈ Τ b.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As the precondition of {a mathematical formula} Α → is independent of soft facts and the first three transition rules of Definitions 16 and 21 are identical for {a mathematical formula}S ⁎ = ∅ , we obtain that {a mathematical formula}on(Fn, Α → )=o ′ (F ′ , Α → ).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The claim follows.Case{a mathematical formula}S ⁎ ={ ⊥ }.In this case {a mathematical formula}Fn → Α → Fn ∈ Τ n and {a mathematical formula}on(Fn, Α → )=Fn as well as {a mathematical formula}o ′ (F ′ , Α → )=F ′ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The claim follows because {a mathematical formula} Π ′ (F ′ )= Π n(Fn).Case{a mathematical formula}{ ⊥ } ≠ S ⁎ ≠ ∅ .We further divide this case according to the first three transition rules of Definitions 16 and 21.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For this purpose the following consistency constraints — temporal formulae — are introduced for each {a mathematical formula}i ∈ {1, … ,n}:{a mathematical formula} It is easy to see that if {a mathematical formula}Ti is true along a path then this path — or the associated strategy of the player that controls {a mathematical formula}xi — represents a truth assignment of {a mathematical formula}xi.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Next we recall from [22] (with small modifications) the following lemma which says that Φ is satisfiable iff there is a consistent strategy of player v such that for all consistent strategies of player r — again, consistent means that truth values are assigned consistently to variables and that it is not invalid — such that eventually {a mathematical formula}winv holds.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This revised model denoted by {a mathematical formula}M ˆ Φ and will later also be used for the problem of the existence of an appropriate normative system.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In the following we have to ensure that normative systems which do not respect this condition, yield some “ bad ” Nash equilibrium.</a>
