<a href="#1" id="1">We say that {a mathematical formula}A is a stable model (an answer set) of Π if {a mathematical formula}A is a model of {a mathematical formula}SM( Π ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We refer this definition to the translational definition.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For convenience, we use {a mathematical formula}AS( Π ) to denote the collection of all stable models of Π .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Two programs are said to be equivalent if they have the same set of stable models.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It was shown that any stable model of a program Π must be a classical model of its completion, i.e.</a>

<a href="#8" id="8">Theorem 1, [4]Let Π be a program.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then, a finite{a mathematical formula} Τ ( Π )-structure is a stable model of Π if and only if it can be expanded to a model of{a mathematical formula}OC( Π ).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Progressional stable modelLet Π be a normal program and {a mathematical formula}M a structure of {a mathematical formula} Τ ( Π ).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}M is called a progressional stable model of Π iff {a mathematical formula}M ∞ ( Π )=M.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In order to prove this theorem, we introduce an alternative equivalent definition, and show that it is equivalent to both the progressional definition and the translational definition described above.Let Π be a program and {a mathematical formula}M a structure of {a mathematical formula} Τ ( Π ).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For example, the following program{a mathematical formula} is loop-free but not recursion-free.</a>
