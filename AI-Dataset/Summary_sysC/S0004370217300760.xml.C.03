<a href="#0" id="0">Agent {a mathematical formula}Aj is called an ancestor of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai in the tree if {a mathematical formula}Aj is the parent of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai, or if {a mathematical formula}Aj is recursively the parent of an ancestor of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If agent {a mathematical formula}Ac was not constrained with {a mathematical formula}Ag then the {a mathematical formula}ECAg(Ae) would have been agent {a mathematical formula}Aa.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One can define the {a mathematical formula}Latest_Divider(Ai) to be the latest ancestor of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai that has more than a single child.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An agent {a mathematical formula}Aj receiving a LB_Request calculates a lower bound on the added cost caused by extending the CPA with an assignment to its variable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When that sub tree finishes its search for a specific assignment {a mathematical formula}vi of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai, the value of {a mathematical formula}Sub_Tree_LB(Ak,vi) for that assignment will be changed to the cost of the best solution of that sub tree.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The agent sends UB messages up to all members of its chain, up to the {a mathematical formula}Latest_Divider(Ai) (inclusive).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">When an agent with more than one child receives a Backtrack message from one of its children, it first updates the {a mathematical formula}Sub_Tree_LB of that child to be the latest UB received from that sub tree.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the improved algorithm, agent {a mathematical formula}Ab received bound information from {a mathematical formula}Aa, together with the CPA message.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that this value is not dependent upon any value assignment of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In other words, {a mathematical formula}Local_Costi(Aj,vi) is the sum of the cost of all constraints between agent {a mathematical formula}Ai with value assignment {a mathematical formula}vi and its ancestors, from the root down to agent {a mathematical formula}Aj, with the latest known value assignments.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The value of the LB_Report message sent by agent {a mathematical formula}Ai to agent {a mathematical formula}Aj is {a mathematical formula}minvi ∈ Di ⁡ Local_Costi(Aj,vi).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Note that agent {a mathematical formula}Ag has no Earlier Constrained Agent from {a mathematical formula}Aa since it is the root agent.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This means that {a mathematical formula}Aa is the first agent in the {a mathematical formula}Local_Costg data structure.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Agent {a mathematical formula}Ag sends a LB_Report(1) message to {a mathematical formula}Aa since 1 is the minimal cost in the relevant row.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The LB_Report message sent back to agent {a mathematical formula}Ac will contain the lower bound of 4.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Note, that at this point if agent {a mathematical formula}Ag receives a CPA message the last line of the {a mathematical formula}Local_Cost data structure will contain the sum of its constraints cost with all other agents, for each of its possible value assignment.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The last message in the example is a new value assignment from agent {a mathematical formula}Ac.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">{a mathematical formula}BestCPA is deleted when agent {a mathematical formula}Ai receives a new CPA from its parent.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">If the agent has only one child, then it shares with its child both UB and {a mathematical formula}Received_UB.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">For example, when agent {a mathematical formula}Ab (Fig.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This adds another consideration – in PT-FB before agent {a mathematical formula}Ai sent a CPA to one of its children {a mathematical formula}Aj it only needed to wait for LB_Reports from {a mathematical formula}Aj's sub-tree.</a>
