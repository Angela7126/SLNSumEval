<a href="#0" id="0">Every action that a BayesAct agent can take (a) has an affective aspect or “ meaning ” ({a mathematical formula}ba in Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The actions of the agent are now expanded to be {a mathematical formula}B={A,Ba}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To predict the fundamental sentiments, we combine the deflection potential from the previous section with an “ inertial ” term that stabilises the fundamentals over time.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This gives the probabilistic generalisation of the affect control principle (Definition 1):{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Ψ (f ′ , Τ ,x)=(f ′ − M(x)G(f ′ , Τ ,x))T Σ − 1(f ′ − M(x)G(f ′ , Τ ,x)) and Ξ represents the temporal “ inertial ” dynamics of {a mathematical formula}f ′ , encoding both the stability of affective identities and the dynamics of affective behaviours.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Ξ is such that {a mathematical formula}fb ′ is equal to {a mathematical formula}ba if the agent is acting, and otherwise is unconstrained, and {a mathematical formula}fa ′ ,fc ′ are likely to be close to {a mathematical formula}fa,fc, respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Equation (8) can be re-written as a set of multivariate Gaussian distributions indexed by x, with means and covariances that are non-linearly dependent on {a mathematical formula}f,ba and Τ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Overall, we are interested in computing the probability distribution over the sentiments and system state given the history of actions and observations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Denoting {a mathematical formula}S={F,T,X}, and {a mathematical formula} Ω ={ Ω f, Ω x}, and {a mathematical formula} Ω t,bt,St are the observations, agent action, and state at time t, we want to compute the agent's subjective belief, given the observations, Ω , and actions, b, up to time t:{a mathematical formula} which can be written as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Pr(st|st − 1,bt) is factored according to Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">1(b):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">facial expressions) can be viewed as a method for communicating an agent's current appraisal of the situation in terms of affective identities that the agent perceives, and would be part of the action space {a mathematical formula}ba.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The perception of emotional displays would be simply integrated into BayesAct using observations of client identity, {a mathematical formula}Fc.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The continuous action space for BayesAct can be handled by leveraging the fact the we can predict what an agent would “ normally ” do in any state according to the affect control principle: it is the action that minimises the deflection.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Given the belief state {a mathematical formula}b(s), we have a probability distribution over the action space giving the probability of each action (see Equation (32)).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This normative prediction constrains the space of actions over which the agent must plan, and drastically reduces the branching factor of the search space.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Denote the “ normal ” or expected affective action distribution as {a mathematical formula} Π † (s)= Π † (fb):{a mathematical formula} where{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} and {a mathematical formula} Σ f † is the same as {a mathematical formula} Σ f given by Equation (24) with {a mathematical formula} Β b2(x) set to infinity (instead of zero) so the behaviour sentiments are unconstrained.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Equation (32) computes the expected distribution over {a mathematical formula}f ′ given {a mathematical formula}b(s) and then marginalises (sums) out the identity components{sup:9} to get the distribution over {a mathematical formula}fb.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">A sample drawn from this distribution could then be used as an action in the POMCP method.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">A POMCP “ rollout ” would then proceed by drawing a subsequent sample from the distribution over client actions, and then repeating the sampling from Equation (32) over agent actions.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">On top of the functions above for a sub-class of Agent, the following parameters need to be set when using BayesAct in general:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Agents take turns acting, and actions are conveyed to the other agent with the addition of some zero-mean normally distributed “ environment ” noise, with standard deviation {a mathematical formula} Σ e.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Fig.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">3(d) has the same identities as Fig.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">3(c), but with {a mathematical formula} Σ e=5.0.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">4(b) shows a specific example where the client shifts between two identities, for {a mathematical formula}sid=0.25 and {a mathematical formula}T=40.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The agent's estimates of {a mathematical formula}Fe are seen to follow the client's changes, although the agent lags behind by about 30 time steps.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">We built a simple tutoring application in which the identities for agent and client are initially set to “ tutor ” ({a mathematical formula}Fa=[1.5,1.5, − 0.2]) and “ student ” ({a mathematical formula}Fc=[1.5,0.3,0.8]), respectively, with low dynamics standard deviations of {a mathematical formula} Β a= Β c=0.01 and {a mathematical formula} Σ r=0.0 (see Section 3.3).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">We have done preliminary simulations with this model by using an agent identity of “ assistant ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[1.5,0.51,0.45]), and an initial client identity of “ patient ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.90, − 0.69, − 1.05]).</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The client knows the identity of the agent, but the agent must learn the identity of the client.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Agent and client both know their own identities.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">We have found that a fixed affective policy may work well for some affective identities, but not for others, whereas the actions suggested by BayesAct work well across the different identities that the client may have.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">For example, if the client really does have the affective identity of a “ patient ” , then always issuing the prompts with an {a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.15,0.32,0.06] (the affective rating of the behaviour “ prompt ” in the ACT database) and otherwise simply “ minding ” the client ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.86,0.17, − 0.16]) leads to the client completing the task in an equal number of steps as BayesAct, and always completing the task within 50 steps.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">However, if the client has an affective identity that is more “ good ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[1.67,0.01, − 1.03], corresponding to “ elder ” ) or more powerful ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.48,2.16,0.94], corresponding to “ boss ” ), then this particular fixed policy does significantly worse.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">We investigated the COACH system in simulation using an agent with an affective identity of “ assistant ” , and a client with an affective identity of “ elder ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[1.67,0.01, − 1.03]).</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">The client knows the identity of the agent, but the agent must learn the identity of the client.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Agent and client both know their own identities.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Table E.11 shows an example simulation between the agent and a client (PwD) who holds the affective identity of “ elder ” .</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">This identity is more powerful and more good than that of “ patient ” (the default).</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Thus, the BayesAct agent must learn this identity (shown as {a mathematical formula}fc in Table E.11) during the interaction if it wants to minimize deflection.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">We see in this case that the client starts with {a mathematical formula}AW= “ yes ” (1) and does the first two steps, but then stops and is prompted by the agent to rinse his hands.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Table E.12 shows the same client ( “ elder ” ) but this time the agent always uses the same affective actions: if prompting, it “ commands ” the user ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[ − 0.09,1.29,1.59]) and when not prompting it “ minds ” the user ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.86,0.17, − 0.16]).</a>
