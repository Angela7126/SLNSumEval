<a href="#0" id="0">We use the {a mathematical formula}ai ⁎ , the {a mathematical formula}ri ⁎ , and {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ to denote an optimal solution to the linear program.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we noted, {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ , the optimal objective value of the linear program, is greater than or equal to the optimal objective value of the original functional optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is, {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ is an upper bound on the competitive ratio of any complete mechanism whose allocation part is linear.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the following theorem, we show that this upper bound can be achieved: we construct a complete mechanism whose allocation part is linear, and prove that this mechanism has a competitive ratio of {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It follows immediately that the mechanism we construct is optimal among all complete mechanisms whose allocation part is linear.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">That is, among all burning-based mechanisms, nothing can outperform the VCG mechanism with redistribution on this profile.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, when there are only two agents, neither agent can collect any redistribution: for either agent, the minimal total payment is always 0 (when we fix the other agent's type and change her own type), because if her type is {a mathematical formula}(0,0, … ,0), then the total payment is 0.</a>
