<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, can-move-pick must be guaranteed to either produce a {a mathematical formula} Τ (1) where the object in question has been picked by the robot, or else return “ false. ” Geometrical effects are not in general added to the symbolic state component, although for domain-debugging purposes, there is an option to do that for specific predicates.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It then attempts to find a feasible sequence of geometric actions and states by changing the geometric choices of the selected actions (call to {a mathematical formula}searchGeomSeq( … ) at line 7).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We first retrieve the already moved objects {a mathematical formula}Ocoll that collided the largest number of times with a robot's hand or grasped object when trying to find a geometric instance of a:{a mathematical formula} where nbColl is the function that returns the number of collisions that were detected between the robot's hand and object o, and collisions that were detected between the object grasped by the robot and object o, and {a mathematical formula}Omoved is the set of objects that have been moved by hybrid actions of P. The statistics used for evaluating nbColl are gathered during the generation of target poses (which precedes motion planning) when the preconditions of {a mathematical formula}ai are evaluated.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, when backtracking occurs for kinematic reasons, the choice of geometric instances can be reduced by using our knowledge of the kinematic model of the robot, together with constraints automatically generated from the symbolic action sequence.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the present section, we evaluate the effect of propagating geometric constraints on the global search process, i.e., combining the symbolic search space and the geometric search space.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As in the previous experiments, our planning system looks for feasible plans without considering any optimization criterion.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">So, the planning process stops, as soon as the planner finds a feasible plan (see line 6 in Algorithm 1).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Without constraint propagation, the algorithm has to perform exhaustive geometric backtrack search before trying another symbolic action.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Because of the large branching factor, this process is intractable, if the branch contains more than 4 or 5 actions.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">With constraint propagation, if the action is infeasible for kinematic reasons, e.g., an object is out of reach, then the constraint propagation mechanism detects an inconsistency, which allows the planner to resume symbolic search without performing exhaustive geometric backtrack search.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, the sampling resolution associated with the shipping area is 84 ({a mathematical formula}7×3 positions and 4 orientations), which implies that, for every problem instance, the final geometric state that results from applying a solution plan from the initial state must contain both pallets side by side in the shipping area, oriented so that their bar codes face the upper side of the map.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The planner performing full geometric backtracking is guided towards solution plans that contain most often four actions (68% of the solution plans for {a mathematical formula}fselREVCHRONO).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">By contrast, the search without geometric backtracking is guided most of the time toward solution plans that contain eight actions (69% of the solution plans).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Finally, using limited geometric backtracking, most of the valid plans generated by the planning system are composed of six actions (58% of the solution plans).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">However, systematically calling a motion planner for evaluating an action at the geometric level may be inefficient for solving the problems that are trivial in terms of geometry and kinematics [38].</a>
