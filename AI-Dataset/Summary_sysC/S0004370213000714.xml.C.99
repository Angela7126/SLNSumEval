<a href="#0" id="0">We say a task subset {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊆ T is achievable by the coalition C if C covers the set of skills {a mathematical formula}S(T ′ )= ⋃ tj ∈ T ′ S(tj).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If {a mathematical formula}T ′ is achievable by coalition C, then we have {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊆ T(C) where {a mathematical formula}T(C) is the set of all tasks the coalition C can achieve.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have assumed free disposal of tasks, so {a mathematical formula}u(T(C)) ⩾ u(T ′ ) and the value of a coalition C is {a mathematical formula}v(C)=u(T(C)) ⩾ u(T ′ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, if for any coalition that can achieve {a mathematical formula}T ′ we have {a mathematical formula}p(C) ⩽ u(T ′ ) − Ε then C has a deficit {a mathematical formula}e(C)=v(C) − p(C) ⩾ Ε and the imputation p is not in the Ε -core.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">On the other hand, {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊆ T, so if for any {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊆ T we have {a mathematical formula}p(C)>u(T ′ ) − Ε , then all coalitions have a deficit of at most Ε , and the imputation p is in the Ε -core.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, to check if the maximal deficit under an imputation is at most Ε (or in other words, to solve ECM), it suffices to examine every task subset {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊆ T and test whether any coalition C that achieves {a mathematical formula}T ′ has a payoff {a mathematical formula}p(C)>u(T ′ ) − Ε .We now note that in bounded CSG domains, there is a constant number of tasks, so there is a constant number of task subsets.</a>
