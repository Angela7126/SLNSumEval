<a href="#1" id="1">If no candidate is found, it means that there is no winning move for the given formula {a mathematical formula}QXQ¯Y. Φ due to Observation 3 and thus the algorithm terminates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since Τ is a winning move for the abstraction, then also {a mathematical formula} Φ [ Μ ][ Τ ] is true (note that Φ does not have any other variables besides X and Y).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For contradiction, let Μ be a countermove to Τ in Φ , i.e., the assignment Μ is a winning move for ∀ Y in {a mathematical formula} ∀ Y. Φ [ Τ ].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From definition of a winning move, it holds {a mathematical formula}¬ Φ [ Τ ][ Μ ].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This is an immediate contradiction because {a mathematical formula} Φ [ Τ ][ Μ ]= Φ [ Μ ][ Τ ] as Τ and Μ are assignments to disjoint sets of variables.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Prenexing this abstraction means introducing for each {a mathematical formula}i ∈ 1..k a fresh set of variables {a mathematical formula}Zi for the variables Z and introducing fresh variables for the variables appearing in the prefix {a mathematical formula}P. Hence, the prenexed form is equal to the following.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">More precisely, for a QBF {a mathematical formula}QX. Φ and a total assignment Τ to the variables X the function decides whether Τ is a winning move for QX in {a mathematical formula}QX. Φ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The function either returns NULL if Τ is a winning move or it returns a set of pairs {a mathematical formula}(i, Μ ), which are pairs that are eventually added to the variable Ω (see Algorithm 6).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Winning under a total assignmentGiven a formula Φ , a quantifier type {a mathematical formula}Q ∈ { ∃ , ∀ }, and an assignment Π to all the input variables and a subset of the ghost variables, we say “ Player Qwins Φ under Π ” iff both of the following conditions hold true:</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">On the other hand, to eliminate all the innermost T variables, the algorithm must, as an intermediate step, construct a formula where {a mathematical formula}|VT|=|T| − 1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Under this assignment, Φ simplifies to{a mathematical formula} No universal variables occur in the above formula, so regardless of how the universal {a mathematical formula}zi variables are assigned, a winning move for the existential player is simply to assign {a mathematical formula}true to all the variables in the innermost block.</a>
