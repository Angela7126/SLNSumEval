<a href="#0" id="0">Observe that the input to the complete set partitioning problem is a list of {a mathematical formula}2n − 1 real values (where n is the size of the ground set), and every algorithm that is guaranteed to find an optimal solution on every instance of this problem has to inspect all of these values.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, the running time of every exact algorithm is at least exponential in n, and in some of the applications we have discussed (such as combinatorial auctions or multi-agent systems) the value of n can be quite large.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, an important goal is to design an algorithm that can find an optimal partition as efficiently as possible, both in the worst case and on average (for realistic value distributions).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To this end, observe that if {a mathematical formula}d=|I| − 1, then there is no need to determine whether {a mathematical formula}{C1, … ,Cd} is promising.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Instead, one can straight away construct the only coalition structure of size {a mathematical formula}|I| containing {a mathematical formula}C1, … ,Cd — it suffices to put all the remaining agents in a coalition of their own.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, whenever the branch-and-bound technique is used, we always have {a mathematical formula}d<|I| − 1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This implies that, when {a mathematical formula}I ⁎ contains exactly one integer, we always have {a mathematical formula}min ⁡ (d,|I ∖ I ⁎ |)=d.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consequently, inequality (E.2) can be written as follows:{a mathematical formula} This way, we get rid of the first modification, and only keep the second one, which takes into consideration only the subspaces that have not yet been searched, and are reachable from {a mathematical formula} Π IA.</a>
