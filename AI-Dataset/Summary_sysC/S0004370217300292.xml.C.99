<a href="#0" id="0">If only the left vendor is assigned buyers (the argument holds symmetrically for the right vendor), the right vendor can attract the right buyers by setting its price to any non-zero value smaller than 2 and increase its utility from 0 to positive.The case where the left vendor gets no left buyers and the right vendor gets no right buyers requires the inequalities {a mathematical formula}v ℓ ℓ − p ℓ ≤ (v ℓ r − pr)+ and {a mathematical formula}vrr − pr ≤ (vr ℓ − p ℓ )+, i.e., {a mathematical formula}5 − p ℓ ≤ (3 − pr)+ and {a mathematical formula}5 − pr ≤ (3 − p ℓ )+; this implies that {a mathematical formula}p ℓ ≥ 5 and {a mathematical formula}pr ≥ 5, which in turn implies that no vendor receives any buyers since they all have negative utility and prefer to abstain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Clearly, this is not an equilibrium since a vendor can attract all buyers, by lowering its price to smaller than 5, and, thus, obtain strictly positive utility.The only remaining case is when some left buyers are assigned to the left vendor and some right buyers are assigned to the right vendor.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This requires the two inequalities {a mathematical formula}v ℓ ℓ − p ℓ ≥ (v ℓ r − pr)+ and {a mathematical formula}vrr − pr ≥ (vr ℓ − p ℓ )+.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to verify that {a mathematical formula}(x,p) is indeed a pure Nash equilibrium, it suffices to run algorithm Verify with input {a mathematical formula}(x,p); this is true since all buyers are assigned to vendors in their demand set, vendors 1, 2 and 3 cannot increase their utility by unilaterally increasing their price as, then, they would lose all assigned buyers, while vendor 4 cannot increase its price, since its assigned buyers would move to vendor 1, and cannot attract new buyers by decreasing its price.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assume otherwise that {a mathematical formula}(x,q¯) is not an equilibrium; we will show that {a mathematical formula}(x,q) should not be an equilibrium as well.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since {a mathematical formula}(x,q¯) is not an equilibrium, there must exist some i such that buyers of type i are assigned to a vendor j in x and satisfy {a mathematical formula}vij ′ − q¯j ′ >vij − q¯j for some vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ that is empty in x.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">From the definition of {a mathematical formula}q¯, this means that {a mathematical formula}vij ′ − cj ′ >vij − qj and vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ could set its price to a sufficiently small but strictly higher than its production cost price to attract the buyers of type i and increase its utility from 0 (since {a mathematical formula}j ′ is an empty vendor according to x) to positive; this contradicts the assumption that {a mathematical formula}(x,q) is an equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Now, clearly, {a mathematical formula}q¯ has the desired structure (i.e., prices equal to production costs) for vendors that are empty in x, and it suffices to prove that {a mathematical formula}p=q¯.For the remainder of the proof, recall that, by the definition of q, {a mathematical formula}qj=q¯j for any non-empty vendor j.Seed vendors.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We will show that no price vector and consistent buyers-to-vendors assignment can be enforced as an equilibrium using an amount of subsidies less than {a mathematical formula}2 − 2 Ε .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The optimal social welfare is {a mathematical formula}8 − 2 Ε and the theorem will follow by setting Ε to a sufficiently small positive value.Consider a buyers-to-vendors assignment x and let {a mathematical formula}p ℓ and {a mathematical formula}pr be the two prices to which x is consistent.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Obviously the cost of {a mathematical formula}s(x ˆ ,p) is {a mathematical formula}|C|.We will now show that for any price vector p to which the optimal assignment {a mathematical formula}x ˆ is consistent, there is a node cover of G of size at most the cost of {a mathematical formula}s(x ˆ ,p).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In order to show this, we will start with an arbitrary price vector p to which {a mathematical formula}x ˆ is consistent and will transform it, through a sequence of rounds that will not violate the consistency of {a mathematical formula}x ˆ to prices and will not increase the cost of the corresponding subsidies, to a price vector with the following properties: all edge vendors have prices equal to {a mathematical formula}(k+1)2, auxiliary node vendors have prices equal to {a mathematical formula}k+3, node vendors corresponding to a node cover C of G have prices equal to {a mathematical formula}k+2 while the remaining node vendors have prices equal to {a mathematical formula}k+3.</a>
