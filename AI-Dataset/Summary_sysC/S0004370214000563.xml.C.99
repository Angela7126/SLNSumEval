<a href="#0" id="0">By using an LP-approach to find independent intervals for schedules in {a mathematical formula}S ′ , we obtain the flexibility of the original system S. We show that in case of STNs this flexibility metric can be computed in polynomial time and offers the possibility to adapt existing schedules in {a mathematical formula}O(1) time.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">1, where {a mathematical formula}S1 specifies the concurrent execution of {a mathematical formula}k=3 events within 5 time units, while {a mathematical formula}S2 specifies the sequential execution of {a mathematical formula}k=3 consecutive events, i.e., {a mathematical formula}t3 should not occur before {a mathematical formula}t2, {a mathematical formula}t2 should not occur before {a mathematical formula}t1, and all events should occur within 5 time units.Note that both in {a mathematical formula}S1 and in {a mathematical formula}S2, for each {a mathematical formula}i ∈ {1,2,3}, {a mathematical formula}est(ti)=0 and {a mathematical formula}lst(ti)=5.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence,{a mathematical formula} So, according to the measure {a mathematical formula}flexN, {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 have the same flexibility, which, of course, is counterintuitive: For each event {a mathematical formula}ti in {a mathematical formula}S1 we can determine its starting time between 0 and 5 independently from the other events.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">So, the total flexibility, expressed as the amount of choice we have in selecting a starting time for an event, equals {a mathematical formula}5×3=15, which corresponds to the value as specified by {a mathematical formula}flexN(S1).The choice for the starting time of an event {a mathematical formula}ti in {a mathematical formula}S2, however, may influence the choice of the starting time of the next event {a mathematical formula}ti+1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">More precisely, if {a mathematical formula}v1,v2,v3 are the latest starting times for the events {a mathematical formula}t1,t2 and {a mathematical formula}t3, respectively, in {a mathematical formula}S2, it is clear that{a mathematical formula} Hence, the flexibility of {a mathematical formula}t1 is {a mathematical formula}v1 − 0, the flexibility of {a mathematical formula}t2 is {a mathematical formula}v2 − v1, and the flexibility of {a mathematical formula}t3 is {a mathematical formula}5 − v2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">So, the total intuitive flexibility of {a mathematical formula}S2 equals{a mathematical formula}Therefore, the flexibility of {a mathematical formula}S2 should come out as only {a mathematical formula}13 of the flexibility of {a mathematical formula}S1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Generalizing {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 to systems containing k concurrent and k sequential events, respectively, we see that the freedom to schedule in {a mathematical formula}S1 equals {a mathematical formula}flex(S1)=5×k, while the flexibility of {a mathematical formula}S2 is independent of k and remains {a mathematical formula}flex(S2)=5.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Hence, if k goes to infinity, the ratio of the more intuitive flexibilities of {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 goes to infinity as well:{a mathematical formula} while their ratio according to {a mathematical formula}flexN is exactly 1:{a mathematical formula} We conclude that in this case, due to dependencies between events, the {a mathematical formula}flexN metric seriously overestimates the flexibility of STNs such as {a mathematical formula}S2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">First of all, we observe that this metric is defined as the sum of intervals, each interval {a mathematical formula}[at,bt] indicating the flexibility of a single event t. Here, flexibility means freedom to choose a real starting time for the event.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Based upon these considerations, we propose the following rationality postulates underlying a naive flexibility metric such as {a mathematical formula}flexN for an STN {a mathematical formula}S=(T,C).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To show that indeed {a mathematical formula}flexN is completely characterized by these postulates, we call a metric captured by these rationality postulates {a mathematical formula}flexn.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We will show that for all metrics {a mathematical formula}flexn satisfying these postulates, it holds that {a mathematical formula}flexn=flexN.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">So let {a mathematical formula}S=(T,C) be an STN.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">A naive flexibility metric {a mathematical formula}flexn is characterized by the following postulates: F1The flexibility {a mathematical formula}flexn(z) of the temporal reference event {a mathematical formula}z ∈ T is equal to 0.Comment.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The temporal reference point should be fixed.F2The flexibility {a mathematical formula}flexn(t) of an event {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T − {z} is a nonempty interval {a mathematical formula}[a,b] such that any {a mathematical formula}v ∈ [a,b] can be chosen as a starting time {a mathematical formula} Σ (t)=v in some schedule Σ for S.Comment.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">To solve the first problem (computing an interval schedule) we use a transformation from a given STN to another STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ and we show that any schedule obtained for the latter can be used to obtain an interval schedule for the former.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">To solve the second problem, we use a Linear Programming approach, realizing that an STN such as {a mathematical formula}S ′ can be represented as a set of linear equations and the objective function is a linear function maximizing the size of the intervals of an interval schedule for the original STN S.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Note that the resulting set of variables and constraints is just another STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ , we call a double STN.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Using Proposition 5, we show that the schedules of this double STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ can be used to construct an interval schedule for the original STN S:</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Take an arbitrary schedule Σ for S and construct an assignment {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ for {a mathematical formula}S ′ as follows: for every {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T, let {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ (t+)= Σ (t − )= Σ (t).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">It is obvious that {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ will satisfy all constraints in {a mathematical formula}C ′ , hence {a mathematical formula}S ′ is consistent.Therefore, we can assume some arbitrary schedule {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ for {a mathematical formula}S ′ .</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">We show that {a mathematical formula}{[ Σ ′ (t − ), Σ ′ (t+)]|t ∈ T} is an interval schedule for S. Take some arbitrary constraint {a mathematical formula}tj − ti ≤ cij in C. By Proposition 5, it is sufficient to show that {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ (tj+) − Σ ′ (ti − ) ≤ cij.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Consider the STN {a mathematical formula}S2 presented in Example 1.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Let STN {a mathematical formula}S2 ′ =(T ′ ,C ′ ) be the double STN derived from S where{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} One possible schedule for {a mathematical formula}S2 is{a mathematical formula} This schedule can be used to construct the following interval schedule for S:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The transformation of an STN S into a double STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ can be used to obtain an interval schedule for S. An arbitrary interval schedule, however, does not suffice to determine the flexibility of an STN, since the sum of the sizes of the intervals obtained does not need to be maximal and therefore does not satisfy F3.</a>
