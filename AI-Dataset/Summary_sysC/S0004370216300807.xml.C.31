<a href="#0" id="0">In order to introduce our map framework we model the Web space as a directed graph.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As will be discussed in Section 4, we use a navigational language to automatically extract regions of the Web.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The benefit of the framework we are going to present is that maps have formally defined properties and can be effectively treated as mathematical objects.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Definition 3.8</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">k-MapsLet {a mathematical formula} Γ =(V Γ ,E Γ ) be a Web Region.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The k-map of Γ is the good map generated by the set of distinguished nodes {a mathematical formula}{v ∈ V Γ :f(v) ≥ k}, where {a mathematical formula}f:V Γ → R is a selective function measuring a specific property of the nodes in Γ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Theorem 3.11</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let{a mathematical formula} Γ =(V Γ ,E Γ )be a Web Region and{a mathematical formula}M( Γ )the set of all good maps over Γ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let{a mathematical formula}Mi=(VMi,EMi) ∈ M( Γ )be the good map obtained by choosing the set of distinguished nodes{a mathematical formula}VMi ⊆ V Γ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then:</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Fig.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">15 summarizes all the elements discussed so far to build maps of Web Regions.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In particular, regions from the Web of Linked Data are obtained via formal specifications in the language {a mathematical formula}L (see the first arrow in Fig.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">15).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A region is the portion of the Web of Linked Data that is navigated during the evaluation of a navigational expression and it is represented as a directed graph (as discussed in Section 4).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Regions are then abstracted by using the framework introduced in Section 3 to obtain a compact representation of reachability information among a set of nodes that have been marked as ‘ distinguished ’ in the region (see the second arrow in Fig.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">15).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Proof</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Given the expression e, the corresponding Web Region can be built in time {a mathematical formula}eval(e)+Ctests (see Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 3.10).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Having the region, the good map can be computed in time {a mathematical formula}O(|N|×(|V Γ ∖ N|+|E Γ |)) where {a mathematical formula}|V Γ | and {a mathematical formula}|E Γ | are the number of nodes and edges of the region and N is the set of distinguished nodes selected by e. □</a>
