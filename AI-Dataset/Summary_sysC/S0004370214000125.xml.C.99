<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, if the question is to find the real solutions of a well-constrained system of equations, then it will generally implement a solution existence (and often uniqueness) theorem, e.g., Miranda, Brouwer or interval Newton [13], that guarantees that the solution box contains a (unique) real solution; on the other hand, if the question is to compute the solution set of a conjunction of inequality constraints, then it will usually implement a universal solution test, which guarantees that every real assignment in the solution box is a solution of the NCSP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As illustrated in Section 2, the kinematic model of a parallel robot can be expressed as a system of equations relating its end-effector pose x and its commands q:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A key issue in robotics is to control a robot while avoiding singularities, in particular because reaching a parallel singularity can dramatically damage a robot.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Property {a mathematical formula}(P3) basically entails that {a mathematical formula} Σ ([x],[q]) and {a mathematical formula} Σ ([x ′ ],[q ′ ]) are connected, and are thus subsets of the same aspect.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, assuming {a mathematical formula}Sk ⊆ S to be a connected component of the undirected graph {a mathematical formula}(S,N), the solution set{a mathematical formula} is fully certified to belong to one single generalized aspect.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence the final output of the process will be several sets of boxes {a mathematical formula}Sk, each of them being certified to enclose one connected set of nonsingular configurations (CSNC).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As mentioned previously, certified approximations of CSNCs are of central importance for practical robot design and usage purposes.</a>
