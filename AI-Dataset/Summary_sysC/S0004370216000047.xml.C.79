<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, in case of program {a mathematical formula} Π ′ one can define an external atom {a mathematical formula}&nodes[](Y), which returns all nodes Y in the graph, and add a rule {a mathematical formula}d(Y) ← &nodes[](Y) to the program to compute the domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The domain atom {a mathematical formula}d(Y) can then be added to the bodies of all rules which use the external domain (in {a mathematical formula} Π ′ this is rule {a mathematical formula}r3 ′ ) in order to make the program strongly safe and allow for evaluating it using the traditional methods.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then there is a ‘ first ’ such external atom {a mathematical formula}&g[v](u) in {a mathematical formula}B(r), i.e., its input list only contains constants which (1) appear in ordinary atoms, (2) appear in lde-safety relevant external atoms, or (3) were already constants in the program.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In all three cases, the input auxiliary rule for {a mathematical formula}&g[v](u) is instantiated for this v because its body atoms are potentially true (ordinary atoms appear also in {a mathematical formula}B(r) and are potentially true, otherwise r would not have been added to {a mathematical formula} Π g; external atoms are all not lde-safety relevant and are potentially true since they are represented with degree 0), i.e., {a mathematical formula}ginp&g(v) appears in the program.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then {a mathematical formula}Ap ∖ Ap ′ must contain at least one atom which is not a replacement atom or an input auxiliary atom, because by construction of {a mathematical formula}Ap such atoms are only set to true if necessary, i.e., if they are supported by A, and all rules used to derive such atoms are also in {a mathematical formula}fgrndC( Π p)Ap.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We now show that the restriction of A to ordinary atoms {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊊ A (i.e., without replacement atoms {a mathematical formula}e&g[y](x) and {a mathematical formula}ne&g[y](x) and without external atom input atoms {a mathematical formula}ginp&g(y)) is a model of {a mathematical formula}fgrndC( Π )A, which contradicts the assumption that A is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}grndC( Π ).Note that, except for the external atom guessing and input auxiliary rules, the reduct {a mathematical formula}fgrndC( Π p)Ap contains the same rules as {a mathematical formula}fgrndC( Π )A with replacement atoms instead of external atoms.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">But this follows from the observation that each run of the loop at (c) corresponds to a (restricted) application of operator {a mathematical formula}G Π ; while {a mathematical formula}G Π instantiates rules whenever their positive body is satisfied by some of the enumerated assignments, our algorithm also respects the negative part of the rule body, i.e., it is even more restrictive.</a>
