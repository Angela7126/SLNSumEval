<a href="#0" id="0">• We model a virtual player for “ Who Wants to be a Millionaire ” game.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">• The virtual player uses Question Answering over Wikipedia and DBpedia knowledge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">• We performed experiments on the Italian and the English version of the game.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">• The virtual player outperforms human players to correctly answer to questions of the game.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">• The virtual player outperforms human players to play real games both in terms of level of the game reached and average income.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We address this question by developing a virtual player based on the proposed QA framework, which leverages Wikipedia and DBpedia open knowledge sources to find the correct answers.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Besides the QA framework, the virtual player adopts a decision making strategy to play the game with all its rules, i.e.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">usage of “ lifelines ” , answering in a condition of uncertainty, retiring from the game by taking the earned money.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Experiments are performed to compare the accuracy of the virtual player against that of human players.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Answer Scoring: leverages the list of text passages extracted from the Question Answering module and adopts several criteria to assign a score to each of the four possible answers to a question.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A detailed description is provided in Section 6;</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">According to the current level of difficulty of the game, the Game Manager selects a question along with the four possible answers, which are then passed to the Question Answering module.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This module exploits the knowledge contained in Wikipedia and DBpedia to select a ranked list of passages of text that likely contain the correct answer to the question.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">These passages are processed by the Answer Scoring, which implements a set of heuristics to come up with a score for each possible answer to the question.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Finally, the Decision Making module decides to provide a specific answer or to retire from the game, by taking into account the scores of the candidate answers, the available lifelines and the current level of the game.</a>
