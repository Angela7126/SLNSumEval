<a href="#0" id="0">This shows how off-the-shelf technologies can produce a pipeline system, running from natural language dialogue about the construction of a mathematical proof, to philosophical theory, to the formal expression of natural language reasoning in dialogue games, and from there to abstract argumentation and argumentation semantics, and finally, coming full circle, to show that implementations of these systems can then provide value back to the mathematical community from which the philosophical theory was derived.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If it is both global and local, i.e., there is a problem both with the argument and the conclusion, then the move consists in modifying the conjecture by incorporating the problematic proof step as a condition.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If it is local but not global, i.e., the conclusion may still be correct but the reasons for believing it are flawed, then the move consists in modifying the problematic proof step but leaving the conjecture unchanged.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If it is global but not local, i.e., there is a problem with the conclusion but no obvious flaw in the reasoning which led to the conclusion, then the move consists in looking for a hidden assumption in the proof step, then modifying the proof and the conjecture by making the assumption an explicit condition.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, in the portion of the Euler conjecture discussion treated in Section 7, the Teacher remarks with respect to a local counterexample: “ I no longer contend that the removal of any triangle follows one of the two patterns mentioned, but merely that at each stage of the removing operation the removal of any boundary triangle follows one of these patterns … I can easily improve the proof, by replacing the false lemma by a slightly modified one, which your counterexample will not refute. ” The discussion can then continue in the same fashion as when the initial problem and proof were proposed.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given their formality, it is not surprising that, at least by default, “ there is no direct connection between formal dialogue games or a theory of sentence meaning and natural language use ” [104, p. 81].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The structural rules typically allows the players to interact in the following way: for example, after the agent claims a proposition Φ his respondent can challenge this proposition, claim it's negation or agree with the speaker; when the agent challenges Φ his respondent can justify this statement with a set of propositions S or withdraw the statement; and so on.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This standard of formal representation of dialogical interaction will be used in Section 3 for expressing Lakatos model as a set of rules for mathematicians to follow, if they aim to collectively prove a conjecture.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">These argument structures should be submittable to a simple, algorithmic procedure which will yield precisely the theory that represents the current shared understanding at any point in the game.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Instead though, {a mathematical formula}HybridCounter uses a simpler characterisation of attack between m and c, introducing a CA directly, rather than adding an argument for the negation of the conjecture.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The reason for this discrepancy is that the negation is required for the action of future moves permitted by LG after {a mathematical formula}GlobalCounter (viz.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}MonsterBar and {a mathematical formula}MonsterAdjust), whilst these moves are not legal following {a mathematical formula}HybridCounter, so the characterisation can be simpler.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}ODefinition allows Opponent to offer an alternative definition, which requires update to the AIF structure not only to include the new definition, e, but also (i) the conflict with Proponent's definition and (ii) the inference from e to Opponent's reason, s, for thinking the counterexample holds.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The approach described in this section shows how as a Lakatos Game is executed, AIF structures are created which, when translated to {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+, produce abstract argumentation frameworks which under grounded semantics have as acceptable arguments all and only those elements which correspond to the mathematical theory accepted by the participants at a given stage of the game.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Second, by virtue of the relationship between {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ and abstract argumentation, we show updates to an abstract framework for the Lakatos Game LG, {a mathematical formula}AFLG= 〈 ARLG,attacksLG 〉 , comprising a set of abstract arguments {a mathematical formula}ARLG and a relation of attacks {a mathematical formula}attacksLG over them following Dung [32].</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">So long as these moves have not come before,{sup:14} and therefore the contents, c and l, have not previously been introduced, the AIF will be updated to include c or l, and there are guaranteed to be no extant conflicts with either c or l (since conflicts can only be introduced by the GlobalCounter, LocalCounter, HybridCounter or {a mathematical formula}StrategicWithdrawal moves which can only follow earlier Conjecture or Lemma moves).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Thus the new abstract framework after a Conjecture(c) move, {a mathematical formula}AFLG ′ , is expanded from the old thus: {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {c} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG (and similarly for Lemma(l)).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">With this argument out, if there are no other pending counterexamples (and the dialogue protocol constrains the discussion to handle just one at a time), the conjecture will be in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Thus, MonsterBar(m, c, r) updates {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {(r, Α )} where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c].</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">For MonsterAdjust, a direct counter, r, to the counterexample m, is introduced along with the symmetrical conflict between them, but also a preference to ensure r defeats m. For {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+, this means that {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {r}, {a mathematical formula}m ‾ ′ =m ‾ ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}r ‾ ′ =r ‾ ∖ {m} (this latter is the result of the AIF PA node).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">As with MonsterBar-ing, if there are no other pending counterexamples (and the dialogue protocol constrains the discussion to handle just one at a time), the conjecture will be in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Thus, for MonsterAdjust(m, r), the associated update is {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {(r,m),(r, Α )}, where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c].</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">At the abstract level, the argument corresponding to this lemma is guaranteed to be in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">That is, for GlobalLemmaInc(m, k), the update is {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {k} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {(k, Α ),(m,k),(k,m)}, where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c].</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">For LocalLemmaInc(m, l, k), the new lemma k is added and guaranteed to be in the grounded extension, and the old is guaranteed to be out as a result of the preceding LocalCounter move.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">So, for LocalLemmaInc(m, l, k), the resulting update to {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ is just {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {k}, with the corresponding update at the abstract level: {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {k} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">For PDefinition, Proponent's definition, d in support of the reason for treating the counterexample as a monster is added to the AIF.</a>
