<a href="#0" id="0">We present a multilingual Named Entity Recognition approach based on a robust and general set of features across languages and datasets.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our system combines shallow local information with clustering semi-supervised features induced on large amounts of unlabeled text.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Understanding via empirical experimentation how to effectively combine various types of clustering features allows us to seamlessly export our system to other datasets and languages.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The result is a simple but highly competitive system which obtains state of the art results across five languages and twelve datasets.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The results are reported on standard shared task evaluation data such as CoNLL for English, Spanish and Dutch.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, and despite the lack of linguistically motivated features, we also report best results for languages such as Basque and German.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In addition, we demonstrate that our method also obtains very competitive results even when the amount of supervised data is cut by half, alleviating the dependency on manually annotated data.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, the results show that our emphasis on clustering features is crucial to develop robust out-of-domain models.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The system and models are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the reproducibility of results.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Our approach consists of shallow local features complemented by three types of word representation (clustering) features: Brown clusters [10], Clark clusters [15] and K-means clusters on top of the word vectors obtained by using the Skip-gram algorithm [39].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We demonstrate that combining and stacking different clustering features induced from various data sources (Reuters, Wikipedia, Gigaword, etc.)</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">allows to cover different and more varied types of named entities without manual feature tuning.</a>
