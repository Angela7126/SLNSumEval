<a href="#0" id="0">The contribution {a mathematical formula}CON(a,A) is an important measure since instead of using the hypervolume directly, most hypervolume-based algorithms such as the steady-state MO-CMA-ES or the SMS-EMOA remove, in the selection step, the individual{a mathematical formula} contributing the least hypervolume to the population A.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This Monte Carlo algorithm returns, for a population A and arbitrary small {a mathematical formula} Ε , Δ >0, an individual {a mathematical formula}a1 ˜ with the property{a mathematical formula} The algorithm samples in the minimal bounding boxes of all contributions and conducts a race between the different candidates until an individual {a mathematical formula}a1 ˜ is found which (with high probability) has a contribution very close to the hypervolume contribution of {a mathematical formula}a1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to determine a good value for this parameter, we conducted a preliminary study of the threshold parameter for the DTLZ benchmark set [18].</a>
