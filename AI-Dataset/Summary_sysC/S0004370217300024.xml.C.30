<a href="#0" id="0">An aggregation rule is a function {a mathematical formula}F:(2V×V)n → 2V×V, mapping any given profile of individual graphs into a single graph.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A representative-voter rule is an aggregation rule F that is such that for every profile E there exists an individual {a mathematical formula}i ⋆ ∈ N such that {a mathematical formula}F(E)=Ei ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The dictatorship of individual {a mathematical formula}i ⋆ ∈ N is the aggregation rule {a mathematical formula}Fi ⋆ with {a mathematical formula}Fi ⋆ :E ↦ Ei ⋆ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An aggregation rule F is called collectively rational with respect to a graph property P if {a mathematical formula}F(E) satisfies P whenever all of the individual graphs in {a mathematical formula}E=(E1, … ,En) do.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Neutrality LemmaFor{a mathematical formula}|V| ⩾ 3, any unanimous, grounded, and IIE aggregation rule that is collectively rational with respect to a contagious graph property must be NR-neutral.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We now know that any Arrovian aggregation rule F that is collectively rational with respect to some contagious graph property P can be fully described in terms of a single family {a mathematical formula}W of winning coalitions, at least as far as F's behaviour on nonreflexive edges is concerned.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, for{a mathematical formula}|V| ⩾ 3, any unanimous, grounded, and IIE aggregation rule F that is collectively rational with respect to P must be oligarchic on nonreflexive edges.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Then, for{a mathematical formula}|V| ⩾ 3, any unanimous, grounded, and IIE aggregation rule F that is collectively rational with respect to P must be dictatorial on nonreflexive edges.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Take any graph property P that is contagious, implicative, and disjunctive, and any aggregation rule F that is unanimous, grounded, and IIE, and collectively rational with respect to P. By Lemma 12, F must be NR-neutral, i.e., on nonreflexive edges, F must be determined by a single family {a mathematical formula}W of winning coalitions.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We shall prove that the {a mathematical formula}W is an ultrafilter (see Definition 21), from which the theorem then follows by Lemma 10.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then, for{a mathematical formula}|V| ⩾ 3, any unanimous, grounded, IIE, and (NR-)neutral aggregation rule F that is collectively rational with respect to P must be (NR-)oligarchic.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Then, for{a mathematical formula}|V| ⩾ 3, any unanimous, grounded, IIE, and (NR-)neutral aggregation rule F that is collectively rational with respect to P must be (NR-)dictatorial.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For{a mathematical formula}|V| ⩾ 3, any unanimous, grounded, and IIE aggregation rule that is collectively rational with respect to transitivity must be oligarchic on nonreflexive edges.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For{a mathematical formula}|V| ⩾ 3, any unanimous, grounded, and IIE aggregation rule that is collectively rational with respect to connectedness must be dictatorial on nonreflexive edges.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">An aggregation rule F is frame collectively rational with respect to a modal integrity constraint Φ if {a mathematical formula} 〈 V,Ei 〉 ⊨ Φ for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N implies {a mathematical formula} 〈 V,F(E) 〉 ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">An aggregation rule F is model collectively rational with respect to a modal integrity constraint Φ if for every valuation {a mathematical formula}Val: Φ → 2V we have {a mathematical formula} 〈 〈 V,Ei 〉 ,Val 〉 ⊨ Φ for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N implying {a mathematical formula} 〈 〈 V,F(E) 〉 ,Val 〉 ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">An aggregation rule F is world collectively rational with respect to a modal integrity constraint Φ if for every valuation {a mathematical formula}Val: Φ → 2V and every world {a mathematical formula}x ∈ V we have {a mathematical formula} 〈 〈 V,Ei 〉 ,Val 〉 ,x ⊨ Φ for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N implying {a mathematical formula} 〈 〈 V,F(E) 〉 ,Val 〉 ,x ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Any unanimous aggregation rule is frame collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula}p → ◇ p.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Any neutral aggregation rule is frame collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula}p → □ ◇ p.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Thus, neither unanimity nor neutrality (nor any other basic axiom we have considered) could possibly guarantee an aggregation rule to be frame collectively rational, or indeed model collectively rational, with respect to {a mathematical formula} ◇ ◇ p → ◇ p, the modal formula corresponding to transitivity.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The best we can say is that all oligarchic rules are frame collectively rational with respect to {a mathematical formula} ◇ ◇ p → ◇ p.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">If an aggregation rule F is such that for every profile E there exists an individual{a mathematical formula}i ⋆ ∈ Nsuch that{a mathematical formula}F(E) ⊆ Ei ⋆ , then F is world collectively rational with respect to all □ -formulas.</a>
