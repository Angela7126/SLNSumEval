<a href="#0" id="0">In general, the abstraction transformation maps the set of states S into a smaller set of abstract states {a mathematical formula}S ′ , such that the distance from {a mathematical formula}u ′ to the closest abstract goal state is at most the distance from u to the closest goal state.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A deadlock is a state {a mathematical formula}u ∈ S which is reachable from s but cannot reach any goal state.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since in Sokoban the goal state is defined implicitly, every placement of the {a mathematical formula}k ′ stones on the k goal squares is an abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">2 shows the abstract goal states for a toy instance with {a mathematical formula}k=4 and {a mathematical formula}k ′ =2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To obtain a lower bound for the maze zone using an IPDB-{a mathematical formula}k ′ , we have to partition all k stones into parts of size {a mathematical formula}k ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Each of the k stones in the state can be part of only one selected subset of {a mathematical formula}k ′ stones.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, it detects all deadlocks formed by {a mathematical formula}k ′ stones and provides good heuristic values.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">State {a mathematical formula}u=(m,p) ∈ S is a goal state if the set of squares occupied by the stones {a mathematical formula}p(B)= ∪ b ∈ Bp(b)=G.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Then,{a mathematical formula} is an admissible heuristic for the maze zone subproblem, where {a mathematical formula}B is a partition of the set of stones in the maze zone B in state {a mathematical formula}u=(p,m) ∈ S into subsets of size {a mathematical formula}k ′ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Global and local linear conflictsFor a given instance decomposition into a maze and a goal zone, a linear conflict of two stones in state {a mathematical formula}u ∈ S is called global, if one of the stones is placed at the cut square.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula}hG(u)=hEMM(u)+2L(u) be the heuristic value of the goal zone subproblem, as described above.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If its new position is in the goal zone or on a goal square {a mathematical formula}hM does not change, since the maze zone subproblem is the same.</a>
