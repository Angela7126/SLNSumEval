<a href="#1" id="1">1 represents a solution for UCAP = 2 (only two sensors and two indicators can be connected to the same unit) and IUCAP = 2 (each unit can at most have two partner units).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">that {a mathematical formula}i1 and {a mathematical formula}i2 are on different units in the solution graph.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Because of Lemma 5 we already know that {a mathematical formula}s1 must be on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}s2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">With respect to the placement of {a mathematical formula}i1 and {a mathematical formula}i2 there are two cases: (a) {a mathematical formula}i1 or {a mathematical formula}i2 is on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2, (b) neither {a mathematical formula}i1 nor {a mathematical formula}i2 is on the same unit as {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2.</a>
