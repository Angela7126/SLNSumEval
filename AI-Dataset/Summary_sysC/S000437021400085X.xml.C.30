<a href="#0" id="0">We analyze this problem from the viewpoint of the vendors, asking under what conditions a vendor should adopt a volume-based price schedule rather than posting a fixed price.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We consider both the case of monopolist vendors and cases where a vendor competes with other vendors.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When vendors have uncertainty about buyers' valuations specified by a known distribution, we show that a vendor is always better off posting a fixed price, provided that buyer types (valuations) are i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">and that other vendors also use fixed prices.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also show that these assumptions cannot be relaxed: if buyer types are not i.i.d., or other vendors post discount schedules, then posting a schedule may yield a higher profit for the vendor.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We provide similar results under a distribution-free uncertainty model, where vendors minimize their maximum regret over all type realizations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In Section 2, we introduce our underlying model, elaborating on the range of buyer behaviors, reviewing the LB model and the behavior it induces within the buying group, and outline the pricing and discounting strategies available to vendors.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We begin our analysis in Section 3, showing that with complete information there is no incentive for vendors to use group discounts.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We outline the Bayesian (expected utility) model in Section 4, and prove that if buyer valuations are independent and identically distributed, and all other vendors use fixed prices, then fixed prices are optimal for any vendor.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, we show that if any of these conditions is relaxed, then a vendor may benefit by posting a discount schedule rather than a fixed price.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Vendors and buyers engage as follows: in the first stage of the game, each vendor posts a discount schedule, a non-increasing vector {a mathematical formula}pj:[n] → R+, where {a mathematical formula}pj(t) is the price offered if t buyers each purchase j's item [1].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let {a mathematical formula}P be the set of all possible discount schedules and {a mathematical formula}P=(p1, … ,pm) a profile of schedules, one per vendor.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We refer to a schedule with a single fixed price as a trivial schedule, which for simplicity is denoted by {a mathematical formula}pj ∈ R+.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Note that {a mathematical formula}S ′ is not the only SBP.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The partition {a mathematical formula}S ″ where all buyers go with vendor 2 is also stable.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Indeed, if buyer a moves to vendor 1, her utility will drop from {a mathematical formula}3 − p2(3)=0 to {a mathematical formula}7 − p1(1)= − 1, and similarly for b and c. However, {a mathematical formula}S ′ is the only Pareto optimal (i.e., undominated) SBP.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Thus {a mathematical formula}S ′ =S(P,V).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Suppose that {a mathematical formula}c1=c2=0, and consider the example given in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Since by our assumption, under {a mathematical formula}P,V buyers partition according to the SBP {a mathematical formula}S ′ (i.e., all buyers choose vendor 1), the utility of the vendors is {a mathematical formula}U1=3 ⋅ p1(3)=3;U2=0.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">As it turns out, the full information model is not especially interesting from our perspective.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In the full information model, there is always a fixed price{a mathematical formula}pjthat is a best response for vendor j to any strategy profile{a mathematical formula}P − jof the other vendors.If the vendors have full information, then they know exactly which buyer partitions will form given any profile of discounts P. Suppose that vendor j expects to have t buyers under some nontrivial schedule {a mathematical formula}pj.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">That is, {a mathematical formula}|Sj|=t, where {a mathematical formula}S=S((p − j,pj),V).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Then j can post a fixed price {a mathematical formula}pj=pj(t) and induce identical buyer behavior S.Let {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ =(p − j,pj).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">To see why S is still an SBP, assume toward a contradiction that some buyer i has a deviation from {a mathematical formula}Sk to {a mathematical formula}Sk ′ under prices {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">First, {a mathematical formula}pk(|Sk|)=pk ⁎ (|Sk|).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">If {a mathematical formula}k ′ ≠ j, then {a mathematical formula}pk ′ (|Sk ′ ∪ {i}|)=pk ′ ⁎ (|Sk ′ ∪ {i}|).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">If {a mathematical formula}k ′ =j, then{a mathematical formula} In either case, buyer i would also deviate under prices P, which is a contradiction.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">In the Bayesian model we assume that there is some joint distribution over buyers' types {a mathematical formula}D=D(A) which is common knowledge among vendors.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The game takes the form {a mathematical formula}G= 〈 D,C 〉 .</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">In the first stage of the game, vendors choose discount schedules, not knowing the buyers' types.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">In the second stage, a type matrix {a mathematical formula}V=(vij)i ∈ N,j ∈ M is drawn from {a mathematical formula}D. The goal of vendor j is to set a schedule {a mathematical formula}pj that maximizes its expected utility:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">First consider the case of a single vendor: suppose a monopolist is faced with distribution {a mathematical formula}D over buyer types.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">By contrast, if buyer valuations are i.i.d., the monopolist is always at least as well off using a fixed price: Consider a single vendor facing n i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">buyers with distribution{a mathematical formula}D. Let{a mathematical formula}p ⁎ be the optimal fixed price for the vendor.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">For any discount schedulep,{a mathematical formula}U(p,D) ≤ U(p ⁎ ,D).</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">We now consider the best response of a vendor to the offers of other vendors.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Suppose vendors other than j post discount schedules {a mathematical formula}p − j.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">The best response of j is:{a mathematical formula} Our main result in the Bayesian model is that, assuming buyer types are independent and drawn from the same distribution, a vendor cannot benefit by using a discount schedule instead of a fixed price unless other vendors also use schedules.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Specifically, relaxing any of the three admits non-trivial schedules as best responses in some circumstances.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">For any pair of conditions taken from (a), (b) or (c), there is a game with two vendors and two buyers where the best response of one vendor is a non-trivial discount schedule.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Consider a simple counterexample with two vendors {a mathematical formula}M={1,2} and two independent (but not i.i.d.)</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">buyers {a mathematical formula}N={a,b}.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Both vendors have zero cost.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">Buyer a prefers vendor 1: {a mathematical formula}va1=10+x, where {a mathematical formula}x ∼ U(0,1]; and {a mathematical formula}va2=10.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">Buyer b prefers vendor 2: {a mathematical formula}vb1=10; and {a mathematical formula}vb2=10+y, where {a mathematical formula}y ∼ U(0,1].</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">1, as every vendor keeps exactly one buyer).</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">We argue that if discounts are not allowed, then {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is an equilibrium, i.e., that no vendor can earn more than 1 by posting a fixed price.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">Indeed, suppose that vendor 1 announces some price {a mathematical formula}q>1, then it keeps buyer a w.p.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">{a mathematical formula}(2 − q), and{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">Nevertheless, if vendor 1 deviates to the non-trivial discount schedule {a mathematical formula}q1 ′ =(1,34), then it can derive higher expected revenue.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">Vendor 1 keeps buyer a as before.</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">Consider the previous game, but with probability {a mathematical formula}12, swap the preferences (types) of both buyers.</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">In other words, either: (i) a prefers vendor 1 and b prefers vendor 2 (with the valuations outlined in the previous example); or (ii) b prefers vendor 1 and a prefers vendor 2; and each of (i) and (ii) occurs with probability {a mathematical formula}12.</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">This results in a symmetric distribution, but one that correlates their valuations of buyers a and b.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">The fixed profile {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1) remains a fixed price equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">Moreover, since the best response of vendor 1 to price 1 is {a mathematical formula}q1=(1,34) regardless of its type, it remains a best response in the new game.</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">Once vendors select strategies (prices) P, suppose that the realized buyer types are given by V. This results in the buyer partition {a mathematical formula}S=S(P,V).</a>
<a href="#57" id="57">We define the regret{a mathematical formula}Regj(P,V) of vendor j relative to this outcome to be the difference between the maximum utility it could have achieved by choosing different prices given this type realization (taking other vendor strategies to be fixed) and its utility given its selected strategy:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}P ′ =(pj ′ ,p − j).</a>
<a href="#58" id="58">Given their uncertainty about the buyer's types, and without a distribution over these types, we assume vendors assess the utility of a strategy by assuming a type profile realization that maximizes the degree to which that strategy is suboptimal.</a>
<a href="#59" id="59">Specifically, let P be a strategy (pricing) profile, where vendor j uses {a mathematical formula}pj.</a>
<a href="#60" id="60">We define the maximum regret of vendor j to be:{a mathematical formula} The goal of each vendor is the selection of a strategy that minimizes its maximum regret given the strategies of other vendors.</a>
<a href="#61" id="61">Let{a mathematical formula}G= 〈 A,C 〉 be a game where{a mathematical formula}Ais symmetric and independent.</a>
<a href="#62" id="62">If all vendors except j use fixed prices, then there is a best response for vendor j that is also a fixed price.Let {a mathematical formula}qj be the schedule that is the best response to {a mathematical formula}p − j, i.e., {a mathematical formula}MaxRegj(qj,p − j) is minimal.</a>
<a href="#63" id="63">Let {a mathematical formula}pj=qj(n), i.e., the price induced by that schedule when j attracts n buyers, and let {a mathematical formula}P=(pj,p − j).</a>
<a href="#64" id="64">We show that {a mathematical formula}MaxRegj(P)=r is also minimal.</a>
<a href="#65" id="65">Intuitively, the proof shows that the only part of j's strategy that impacts its utility (in the worst case) is the price set in the schedule for all n buyers.</a>
<a href="#66" id="66">Thus, the fixed price {a mathematical formula}pj=qj(n) is as good as schedule {a mathematical formula}qj.Consider {a mathematical formula}MaxRegj(pj,p − j) as a function of {a mathematical formula}pj.</a>
<a href="#67" id="67">For any {a mathematical formula}pj, there is some type matrix {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ where maximum regret under P is realized, i.e., {a mathematical formula}Regj(P,V ⁎ )=MaxRegj(P)=r.</a>
<a href="#68" id="68">There is an optimal price {a mathematical formula}pj ′ for {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ such that {a mathematical formula}Regj(P,V ⁎ )=Uj((pj ′ ,p − j),V ⁎ ) − Uj(P,V ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#69" id="69">With identical types spaces, we see that discounts provide no value to a vendor if other vendors use fixed prices.</a>
<a href="#70" id="70">However, analogous to the Bayesian model, if the type spaces of some buyers differ from those of others, then the maximum regret of a vendor can be (strictly) minimized by posting a non-trivial schedule.</a>
