<a href="#1" id="1">weather and events).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We propose a deep-learning-based approach, called ST-ResNet, to collectively forecast two types of crowd flows (i.e.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">inflow and outflow) in each and every region of a city.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic.</a>
