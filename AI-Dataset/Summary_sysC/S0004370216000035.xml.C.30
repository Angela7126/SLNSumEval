<a href="#0" id="0">Section 4 develops query complexity results for certain forms of monotone predicates; it is shown that minimal sets for these predicates can be computed with a logarithmic number of calls to an NP oracle that provides a witness (the class {a mathematical formula}FPNP[wit,log]).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Section 5 extends the results of the previous section for function problems that have exactly a constant number of minimal sets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is shown that all predicates of the form {a mathematical formula}B have a unique minimal set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Further, for all predicates of forms {a mathematical formula}L and {a mathematical formula}B, a minimal set can be calculated by a logarithmic number of calls to a witness oracle.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For predicates of the form {a mathematical formula}P, it is shown that if there is only a unique minimal set, then this minimal set can also be calculated by a logarithmic number of calls to a witness oracle.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Predicates of form {a mathematical formula}P with more than one minimal set are investigated in Section 5.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The function problem of computing the set of independent variables of{a mathematical formula}F(FVInd) has a unique minimal set.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For predicates of form {a mathematical formula}B, a minimal set can be computed with a polynomial number of non-adaptive calls to an NP oracle, or, with a logarithmic number of calls to an NP witness-oracle.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Lemma 4 together with the fact that {a mathematical formula}MaxSet ∈ FPNP[wit,log] enables constructing a minimal set for predicates of form {a mathematical formula}P whenever the minimal set is unique.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let Γ be anMSMPproblem represented by a monotone predicate P of form{a mathematical formula}P, such that Γ has exactly one minimal set.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then,{a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ FP ∥ NPand{a mathematical formula} Γ ∈ FPNP[wit,log].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This section extends the results of Section 4 to the case when it is known that there are exactly k minimal sets, for some constant k. Given the results of previous sections, form {a mathematical formula}P is the only predicate form of interest, since function problems represented with predicates of either form {a mathematical formula}L or {a mathematical formula}B can be solved with a logarithmic number of witness oracle calls (see Fig.</a>
