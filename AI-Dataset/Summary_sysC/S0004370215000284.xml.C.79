<a href="#0" id="0">In this study, we propose a new reinforcement learning algorithm for the decision maker called Relational Exploration with Demonstrations (REX-D), which can learn to perform manipulation tasks based on only a small number of action executions with the help of a teacher guided by rule analysis.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In our approach, we learn general relational models using the relational generalization of REX, but we also include teacher demonstrations and rule analysis to reduce the number of experiences required even further, as well as facilitating generalization over different tasks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In summary, we propose a RL algorithm that can request demonstrations from a teacher whenever it requires new unknown actions to complete a task, which significantly reduces the number of experiences required to learn.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Adding new actions allows the robot to apply previous knowledge to different tasks that may require new actions, while optimal demonstrations provide more information to the learner than random exploration.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Experiences comprises a set of triples {a mathematical formula}E=(s,a,s ′ ), which represent the new state s obtained after executing the action a in state s. We say that a rule covers an experience when the rule preconditions are satisfied by s, the rule represents the action executed {a mathematical formula}ar=a, and the effects of the rule are the changes between the initial and the final state for the experience {a mathematical formula} Ω r,i=s ′ ∖ s.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In addition, even if the teacher knows the optimal (or near optimal) policy, implementing a policy in a robot is a very tedious task, which may take a much longer time to model and to test properly compared with learning it using the proposed algorithm.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If the effects{a mathematical formula} Ω rmissingare required to achieve the goal and no other rule can obtain the predicates, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} ∃ p ∈ Ω rmissing| ∀ r ′ ∈ Γ ′ ,p ∉ Ω r ′ , then an excuse Φ that includes the necessary changes to{a mathematical formula} Ω rmissingis an acceptable excuse.</a>
