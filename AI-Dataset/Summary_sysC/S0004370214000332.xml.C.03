<a href="#0" id="0">If this polynomial-time analysis does not solve the problem, an {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ algorithm is used to identify an optimal protein design.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each term in the energy can be computed for each amino acid/rotamer (or pair for {a mathematical formula}E(ir,js)) independently.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The problem is to identify at each position i a pair from {a mathematical formula}Di such that the overall energy E is minimized.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, DEE pre-processing is usually followed by an {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When the DEE algorithm does not significantly reduce the search space, the {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search tree can be too slow or memory demanding and the problem cannot be solved.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A Cost Function Network (CFN) is a pair {a mathematical formula}(X,W) where {a mathematical formula}X={1, … ,n} is a set of n variables and W is a set of cost functions.</a>

<a href="#8" id="8">Soft arc consistency ({a mathematical formula}AC ⁎ ) [79], [54] requires NC and also that every value r of every variable i has a support on every cost function {a mathematical formula}E(ir,js) involving i.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Enforcing a local consistency may increase {a mathematical formula}E ∅ and thus improve the lower bound on the optimal cost.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The resulting network is equivalent to the original network, but it has an increased lower bound {a mathematical formula}E ∅ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let {a mathematical formula}k=3.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Function {a mathematical formula}DominanceCheck(i,u,r) computes the sum of worst-cost differences as defined by Eq.</a>
