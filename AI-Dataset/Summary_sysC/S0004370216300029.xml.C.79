<a href="#0" id="0">We restrict our attention here to formulas of the form{a mathematical formula} which correspond in a natural way to rules of form (1) where for {a mathematical formula}l=0, the formula {a mathematical formula}a1 ∨ ⋯ ∨ al is ⊥ ; every program P corresponds then similarly to a theory (set of formulas) {a mathematical formula} Γ P.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The truth value assigned by {a mathematical formula}I Κ to a propositional variable a is defined by{a mathematical formula} The semi-stable models of a program P are obtained from its epistemic transformation{a mathematical formula}P Κ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Epistemic Transformation {a mathematical formula}P Κ [49]Let P be a disjunctive program.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Regarding the existence of split sequence {a mathematical formula}SEQ-models, we obtain a generalization of Proposition 13.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">They show that {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model semantics is with respect to model checking (MCH) and inference (INF) one level higher up in the polynomial hierarchy than the {a mathematical formula}EQ-model (i.e., answer set) semantics; this is not surprising as the characterization of a {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model in Theorem 2 involves besides h-minimality also gap-minimality, while the {a mathematical formula}EQ-model definition involves only h-minimality.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note, however, that the program is not a straightforward encoding of the semantic characterization of {a mathematical formula}SEQ-models in Theorem 2; the class of {a mathematical formula}PE-models does not contain all h-minimal HT-models of P, but sufficiently many to single out all the {a mathematical formula}SEQ-models by gap minimization.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It assigns each normal logic program P, in our terminology, an HT-model {a mathematical formula}WF(P)=(I,J) (called the well-founded model) such that all atoms in I are regarded as being true and all atoms not in J being false; all the remaining atoms (i.e., those in {a mathematical formula}gap(WF(P))) are regarded as undefined (rather than possibly true, as in HT-logic).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, the program P in Example 4 has a single P-stable model, and thus P has a single L-stable model which coincides with its well-founded model; thus we cannot conclude under L-stable semantics from P that {a mathematical formula}visits_barber(joe) is false.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Also the program in Example 22 has a single P-stable (and L-stable) model in which all atoms are undefined, while c is true under {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model semantics.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Similarly, the program{a mathematical formula} has a single P-stable (and thus L-stable) model in which all atoms are undefined; if we add the rules {a mathematical formula}d ← a, {a mathematical formula}d ← b, and {a mathematical formula}d ← c to P, the new program cautiously entails under both semi-stable and {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model semantics that d is true, but not under L-stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let P be a normal program (possibly containing constraints) such that{a mathematical formula}WF(P)exists and let S be an arbitrary splitting sequence of P. Then P has some{a mathematical formula}SEQS-model M such that{a mathematical formula}M ⊑ WF(P), and moreover every{a mathematical formula}SEQS-model M of P such that{a mathematical formula}gap(M) ⊆ gap(WF(P))satisfies{a mathematical formula}M ⊑ WF(P).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This lemma in turn follows from Proposition 12 in [19], which states this property for partial stable models of constraint-free (even disjunctive) programs, and {a mathematical formula}WF(P) is the least partial stable model; note also that constraints in P merely determine the existence of {a mathematical formula}WF(P) but do not influence the truth valuation of atoms.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The computational complexity of the reasoning tasks that we considered in Section 7 (Table 1, Table 2) remains the same except that Problem COH is {a mathematical formula} Σ 2p-complete for disjunctive and disjunctive stratified programs (the problem amounts to deciding whether some h-minimal HT-model {a mathematical formula}(X,Y) of the program P exists such that {a mathematical formula}gap(X,Y) ⊆ B, which is in {a mathematical formula} Σ 2p; the matching hardness follows immediately from the results on answer set existence in [16]).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence, by Proposition 4, we need to show that {a mathematical formula}B+(r) ⊆ (M ∩ Σ ) implies {a mathematical formula}(M ∩ Σ ) ∩ H(r) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since {a mathematical formula}r ∈ P Κ , this follows from the assumption, i.e., {a mathematical formula}M ⊨ P Κ implies {a mathematical formula}M ⊨ r, and therefore if {a mathematical formula}B+(r) ⊆ M, then {a mathematical formula}M ∩ H(r) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For cautious reasoning from disjunctive and stratified disjunctive programs under {a mathematical formula}SEQ-semantics, {a mathematical formula} Π 3P-hardness of item (ii) in Theorem 11 is shown by a slight extension of the reduction, which is carried out in Appendix C.2 to derive this result for fixed truth value v.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Now the {a mathematical formula}SEQS-models of P are, by definition,{a mathematical formula} If the model {a mathematical formula}N2 appears in this set, then it is an {a mathematical formula}SEQS-model of P that refines {a mathematical formula}WF(P) and proves the first claim of the proposition.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Otherwise, some {a mathematical formula}SEQS-model {a mathematical formula}N ′ of P must exist such that {a mathematical formula}gap(N ′ ) ⊂ gap(N2); as {a mathematical formula}N ′ is a {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model of P and {a mathematical formula}gap(N ′ ) ⊆ gap(WF(P)), it follows from Corollary 11 that {a mathematical formula}N ′ ⊑ WF(P), and also in this case an {a mathematical formula}SEQS-model of P that refines {a mathematical formula}WF(P) exists; this proves the first claim of the proposition.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">As for the second claim, by Corollary 11 every {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model M of P, and thus in particular every {a mathematical formula}SEQS-model M of P such that {a mathematical formula}gap(M) ⊆ gap(WF(P)) satisfies {a mathematical formula}M ⊑ WF(P); thus if we let M in the argument above be an arbitrary {a mathematical formula}SEQS-model of P, we arrive at {a mathematical formula}N2=M and thus the second claim holds.</a>
