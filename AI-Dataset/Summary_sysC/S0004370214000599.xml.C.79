<a href="#0" id="0">Specifically, the BP-AR-HMM defines {a mathematical formula} Π j(i) by introducing a set of gamma random variables, {a mathematical formula} Η jk(i), and setting{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The positive elements of {a mathematical formula} Π j(i) can also be thought of as a sample from a finite Dirichlet distribution with only {a mathematical formula}K(i) dimensions, where {a mathematical formula}K(i)= ∑ kfk(i) represents the number of states channel i uses.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Sampling the variables associated with the individual channel i involves first sampling active features {a mathematical formula}f(i) (while marginalizing {a mathematical formula}z1:T(i)), then conditioning on these feature assignments {a mathematical formula}f(i) to block sample the state sequence {a mathematical formula}z1:T(i), and finally sampling the transition distribution {a mathematical formula} Π (i) given the feature indicators {a mathematical formula}f(i) and state sequence {a mathematical formula}z1:T(i).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}zt denote the vector of N channel states at time t. Since the space of {a mathematical formula}zt is exponentially large, we cannot integrate it out to compute the marginal conditional likelihood of the data given the event state sequence {a mathematical formula}Z1:T (and model parameters).</a>
