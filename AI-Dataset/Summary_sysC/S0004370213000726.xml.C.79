<a href="#0" id="0">We prove that for a non-PC CNF formula with s occurrences of literals there always exists a resolution proof of length {a mathematical formula}O(s) of some empowering implicate.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the other hand, we construct examples of CNF formulas where a resolution proof of length {a mathematical formula} Ω (s) is needed for any empowering implicate, which means that {a mathematical formula} Θ (s) is an asymptotically tight bound for this problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show (by a simple modification of results concerning refutation proofs [19], [20]) that there exist CNF formulas such that in order to derive any prime empowering implicate of such CNF a resolution proof of an exponential length is needed.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular we require that for any {a mathematical formula}D(X):{a mathematical formula} What we in fact require here is that {a mathematical formula} Φ P is unit refutation complete with respect to the partial assignments to the input variables x.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular we require that for any {a mathematical formula}D(X) and any {a mathematical formula}xi,j:{a mathematical formula} What we in fact require here is the fact that {a mathematical formula} Φ P is propagation complete with respect to partial assignments and literals on the input variables in x.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The core of the proof of Theorem 3.6 shows that considering a smaller set {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊆ S of all empowering implicates of Φ does not make this test easier.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In particular, we shall show that if a clause C is an empowering implicate of a CNF formula Φ , we can always extend C by adding suitable literals to obtain clause {a mathematical formula}C ′ which is still empowering and moreover we can check that {a mathematical formula}C ′ is an implicate of Φ simply by unit resolution.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The following proposition shows that not only can we find a 1-provable and empowering implicate as in Theorem 4.2 but we can also derive some empowering implicate by a resolution derivation of linear length with respect to the number of literals occurring in given formula.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the first phase we take all unit clauses from {a mathematical formula}¬C Φ and perform unit resolutions only over the variables from {a mathematical formula}C Φ .In the second phase we continue with refutation proof without using unit clauses from {a mathematical formula}¬C Φ and we do not resolve over variables from {a mathematical formula}C Φ at all.Let us now assume that</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}D1 ′ , … ,Dm ′ = ⊥ is a unit refutation proof which proceeds in the above two phases.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For each n there is a Horn formula on{a mathematical formula}2n+1variables with n clauses that it is not propagation complete but resolution derivation of length n is needed to find an empowering implicate.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In [19] (and in many papers and books that followed) it was shown that pigeon hole principle formulas on {a mathematical formula}n(n+1) variables and {a mathematical formula}O(n3) clauses ({a mathematical formula}PHPn) have minimal resolution refutation of size {a mathematical formula}cn for some {a mathematical formula}c>0.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The lower bound on the length of a resolution refutation of a {a mathematical formula}PHPn formula is only superpolynomial with respect to the length of the formula.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Examples of formulas on {a mathematical formula} Θ (n) variables consisting of {a mathematical formula} Θ (n) clauses were given in [20] for which the lower bound on the length of a minimal resolution refutation is truly exponential.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">There is a uniform and size increasing family of CNF formulas parameterized with the number of variables n and where the number of clauses is{a mathematical formula}O(n), such that the number of implicates that needs to be added to a CNF formula Φ on n variables from this family to make it propagation complete is exponential in n (and thus in the size of the formula, too).</a>
