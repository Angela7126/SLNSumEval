<a href="#1" id="1">The edge {a mathematical formula}e1 in Map 1 is not present in Map 2; note that the only path between J. Ford and W. Allen in the region is J. Ford → E.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula} Γ =(V Γ ,E Γ ) be a Web Region, where {a mathematical formula}V Γ and {a mathematical formula}E Γ are the set of nodes and directed edges, respectively.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The idea of a map is essentially that of representing reachability information between pairs of distinguished nodes, in a concise way, that is, nodes in the set {a mathematical formula}VM ⊆ V Γ .</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">When dealing with k-maps, the nodes {a mathematical formula}VMk ⊆ V Γ to be included in the map are obtained by checking the value of f for each node.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The array {a mathematical formula}VM contains the set of distinguished nodes, that is, nodes around which the map is built.</a>
