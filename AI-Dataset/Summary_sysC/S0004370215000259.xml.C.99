<a href="#1" id="1">We were inspired by those previous approaches to build the virtual player for the WWBM game, and we borrowed most of the techniques adopted in the AVE task, such as techniques based on lexical processing and computation of an approximate match between passages of text and candidate answers (Section 6).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The result obtained for English is similar to that achieved in [25], in which the system correctly answered about {a mathematical formula}75% of questions, even though a different and smaller dataset was used.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">30% of the other errors are due to the wrong scoring of answers or to other factors, such as the heuristics to recognize and manage negative questions (Section 6).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, in order to evaluate how much effective that strategy is, we have evaluated on one hand the accuracy of regular expressions at correctly detecting negative questions, and on the other hand the effectiveness of the reverse scoring method.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The accuracy of the heuristics based on the use of regular expressions is {a mathematical formula}F1=89.23% for the Italian dataset, and {a mathematical formula}F1=98.20% for the English one, while the reverse scoring method was evaluated by taking into account the percentage of negative questions for which the reverse scoring strategy was useful (i.e.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The dataset of 1960 Italian questions was randomly split into 98 disjoint sets of 20 questions each; each set was assigned to a different user, who provided the answers without having the possibility to consult the Web or other knowledge sources (the level of each question was not disclosed to the users).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As baseline we queried Google with each question and we retrieved the top-30 snippets of text returned by the search engine.</a>
