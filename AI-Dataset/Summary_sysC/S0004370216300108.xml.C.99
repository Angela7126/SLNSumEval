<a href="#0" id="0">The {a mathematical formula}MC-inconsistency measure{a mathematical formula}Imc:K → R ≥ 0 ∞ is defined as{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}K ∈ K.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that the subtraction of 1 in the definition of {a mathematical formula}Imc is to ensure that a consistent knowledge base has inconsistency value 0 (a consistent knowledge base has one maximal consistent subset, itself, and no self-contradictory formulas).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In its simplest implementation, the inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}IMI is defined to be exactly the number of the minimal inconsistent subsets of a knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Accordingly, in order to determine the number {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMI,n) it is necessary to investigate how many different minimal inconsistent subsets a knowledge base with n formulas may possess.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}Cl(Imc,n)= ∞ Note that {a mathematical formula}n>1 is assumed as trivially {a mathematical formula}Cl(Imc,1)=1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note furthermore that for {a mathematical formula}n=2 only literals are allowed as formulas in {a mathematical formula}K. Consider the family of knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}Ki3={a1,¬a1, … ,ai,¬ai} and observe that {a mathematical formula}|Ki3|=2i and {a mathematical formula}Imc(Ki3)=2i (every interpretation Ω corresponds to a maximal consistent subset of {a mathematical formula}Ki3, i.e., the union of all {a mathematical formula}ai with {a mathematical formula} Ω (ai)=true and {a mathematical formula}¬ai with {a mathematical formula} Ω (ai)=false; adding any other formula from {a mathematical formula}Ki3 makes this set inconsistent).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As only formulas of maximum length 2 are used in {a mathematical formula}Ki3 it follows that {a mathematical formula}Cl(Imc,n)= ∞ .</a>
