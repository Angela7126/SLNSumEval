<a href="#0" id="0">However, such a simple solution suffers from some critical drawbacks: (i) when studying OTL on homogeneous domains, it could suffer from negative transfer (transferred knowledge is harmful to learning target task) whenever there exists much significant difference between two conditional probabilities; and (ii) when studying OTL across heterogeneous domains, the old classifiers cannot be trained continuously with the new features because of the inconsistence of the two feature spaces.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In addition to these two challenges, we note that online transfer learning is in general more challenging than a classical batch transfer learning task.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To overcome the challenge of parameter selection for {a mathematical formula}Pi, in this paper, we propose an automated parameter selection technique, an Online Window Adjustment (OWA) algorithm as shown in Algorithm 5, which can automatically determine a proper value for window size parameter {a mathematical formula}Pi during the online learning process.</a>
