<a href="#0" id="0">In fact, {a mathematical formula}2n+1 is the worst-case bound we obtain, and for most problem instances with more than 1001 regions, the methodology from Section 5 will still allow us to derive that convex solutions in {a mathematical formula}Rn must exist.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consider the RCC8 network Θ defined by{a mathematical formula} It is easy to verify that this network does not have a convex solution in {a mathematical formula}R. However, as Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There exists a consistent atomic RCC8 network over{a mathematical formula}{EC,DC}which has no convex solution in{a mathematical formula}R2.Consider the consistent atomic RCC8 network Θ containing the following constraints:{a mathematical formula} as well as the constraint xDCy for every pair of variables {a mathematical formula}(x,y) from {a mathematical formula}{a,b,c,u,v,w} which does not appear in the list above.Assuming that a convex solution {a mathematical formula}S of Θ in the plane exists, we can draw {a mathematical formula}K3,3 as follows.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For every{a mathematical formula}n ≥ 1there exists a consistent atomic RCC5 network Θ over{a mathematical formula}{DR,PO,PP,PP − 1}which has no convex solution in{a mathematical formula}Rn.Let {a mathematical formula}n ≥ 1 be arbitrary and consider the following set of RCC5 constraints Θ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For every{a mathematical formula}n ≥ 1, there exist consistent atomic RCC8 networks over the following sets of base relations which have no convex solutions in{a mathematical formula}Rn:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To show that consistent networks with {a mathematical formula}2n+1 variables have a convex solution in {a mathematical formula}Rn we first need a number of technical lemmas.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network and assume that{a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ V ′ has a convex weak solution in{a mathematical formula}Rkin which everyO-clique has a common part.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let{a mathematical formula}u ∈ V ∖ V ′ be such that{a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ (V ′ ∪ {u})is a network over{a mathematical formula}{EC,PO,TPP,TPP − 1}and assume that one of the following conditions is satisfied:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}It holds that{a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ (V ′ ∪ {u})has a convex solution in{a mathematical formula}Rk+1in which everyO-clique has a common part.Let {a mathematical formula}S be a k-dimensional convex weak solution of {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ V ′ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In [23] it was shown that deciding whether a set of RCC8 constraints has a convex solution in {a mathematical formula}R2 is as hard as deciding the consistency of a set of algebraic equations (of similar size) over the real numbers.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We show that Ψ has a convex solution in {a mathematical formula}Rn iff Θ has a convex solution in {a mathematical formula}Rn − 1.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">First suppose that Θ has a convex solution {a mathematical formula}S in {a mathematical formula}Rn − 1 and let {a mathematical formula}X=CH{S(v)|v ∈ V}.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Then we can define a convex solution {a mathematical formula}T of Ψ in {a mathematical formula}Rn as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} and for each {a mathematical formula}u ∈ V{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} It is straightforward to verify that {a mathematical formula}T is indeed a convex solution of Ψ .</a>
