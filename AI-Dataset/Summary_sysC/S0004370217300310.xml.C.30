<a href="#0" id="0">The founders of AI envisioned the notion of embedded intelligence as being conjoined between perception, reasoning and actuation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Yet over the years the fields of AI and Robotics drifted apart.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Practitioners of AI focused on problems and algorithms abstracted from the real world.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This special issue brings together the state of the art and practice of the emergent field of integrated AI and Robotics, and highlights the key areas along which this current evolution of machine intelligence is heading.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Third, having gone through an ‘ AI Winter ’ , researchers have not only become more adept at divining what techniques and representations are likely to be promising, they have also made substantial inroads into the science of both AI and Robotics — contributions to this special issue clearly showcase this.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Most AI researchers were driven by top-down (and abstract) reasoning, rarely connecting with the physical world.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Reasoning ignored the physicality and embodiment in automation, assuming that a symbolic description of the problem was given, and that a symbolic description of the solution could actuate in the physical world, leading to decades of “ disembodied ” AI.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Conversely, researchers in the field of robotics took a more bottom-up approach, mostly ignoring the reasoning aspects and focusing instead on the embodiment.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Not only has this meeting led to planning this Special Issue, but it has also regularly brought together students and academics across the world to a series of Winter Schools,{sup:3} to study the state of the art and practice in integrated AI and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">With these events and this Special Issue, we hope a vibrant community of researchers will take on the challenge of pulling the diverse threads across these disciplines and confront new challenges.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">One would expect that this research line leverages the rich AI tradition in knowledge representation and ontologies.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Instead, much of the current work on semantic maps in robotics makes little or no use of this tradition, and has sometimes developed solutions that are entirely independent from the concepts and techniques in AI.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Most AI techniques address a single cognitive ability and rely on a single type of knowledge.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">But robots must deal with a diversity of cognitive abilities and of types of knowledge, and must do so in an integrated way.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The applicability of a given AI technique, designed to provide a certain cognitive ability, to robotics may depend on its ability to address one or more of the above challenges.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In general, cognitive abilities and robotic challenges can be organized in the matrix shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">{sup:6} The 18 contributions to this special issue illustrate how AI methods and techniques addressing a given cognitive ability can be extended to address some of our four robotic challenges.</a>
