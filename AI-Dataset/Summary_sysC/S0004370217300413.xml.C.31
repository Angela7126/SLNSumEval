<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, we might consider the question of verifying whether a given strategy profile represents a Nash equilibrium: NE-Membership:Given: Multi-agent system M, strategy profile {a mathematical formula} Σ → .Question: Is {a mathematical formula} Σ → a Nash equilibrium?</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If {a mathematical formula}( Ρ ,0) ⊨ Φ , we write {a mathematical formula} Ρ ⊨ Φ and say that Ρ satisfies Φ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We say that Φ and Ψ are equivalent if for all Ρ we have {a mathematical formula} Ρ ⊨ Φ if and only if {a mathematical formula} Ρ ⊨ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Ltl is satisfiable if there is some run satisfying Φ ; moreover, it is satisfied by a Kripke structure K if it is satisfied by all its initial runs, that is, if, and only if, it is satisfied by all {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ runs(K).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As usual, we say that the size of an LTL formula Φ , denoted by {a mathematical formula}| Φ |, is its number of subformulae.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula} Φ i ⊆ Φ is the (finite) set of variables controlled by {a mathematical formula}mi;</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}Ii is a (finite) set of initialisation guarded commands, such that for all {a mathematical formula}g ∈ Ii, we have {a mathematical formula}ctr(g) ⊆ Φ i; and</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}Ui is a (finite) set of update guarded commands, such that for all {a mathematical formula}g ∈ Ui, we have {a mathematical formula}ctr(g) ⊆ Φ i.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}A=(N, Φ ,m1, … ,mn) is an srml arena with components as defined earlier;</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N, the formula {a mathematical formula} Γ i is the goal of player i, represented as a temporal logic formula; in what follows, we consider both LTL and CTL as possible goal languages.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Games in which all players have goals expressed as LTL formulae are called LTL RMGs, while games in which players have goals expressed as CTL formulae are called CTL RMGs.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Both types of game are played by each player i selecting a strategy{a mathematical formula} Σ i that will define how to make choices over time.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In the case of LTL RMGs strategies will be deterministic, whereas for CTL RMGs strategies are non-deterministic.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">(Formal definitions will be given shortly.)</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Then, once every player i has selected a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i, a strategy profile{a mathematical formula} Σ → =( Σ 1, … , Σ n) results and the game has an outcome, which given the nature of the strategies will be:</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">A run (an infinite word), denoted by {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( Σ → ), for LTL RMGs;</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">A Kripke structure, denoted by {a mathematical formula}K Σ → , for CTL RMGs.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Let us fix some notation.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We will write {a mathematical formula} Φ − i for {a mathematical formula} Φ ∖ Φ i and let {a mathematical formula}Vi (respectively, {a mathematical formula}V − i) denote the set of valuations to variables in {a mathematical formula} Φ i (respectively, {a mathematical formula} Φ − i).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Now, given {a mathematical formula}A=(N, Φ ,m1, … ,mn), an srml arena, we define a deterministic strategy for module {a mathematical formula}mi=( Φ i,Ii,Ui) as a structure {a mathematical formula} Σ i=(Qi,qi0, Δ i, Τ i), where</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">{a mathematical formula}qi0 ∈ Qi is the initial state,</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">{a mathematical formula} Δ i:Qi×V − i → Qi is a transition function, and</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">{a mathematical formula} Τ i:Qi → Vi is an output function.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Note, in particular, that not all strategies for a given module will comply with that module's specification.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">For instance, if the only guarded command of a module {a mathematical formula}mi has the form {a mathematical formula} ⊤ ↝ x ′ := ⊥ , then a strategy for {a mathematical formula}mi should not prescribe {a mathematical formula}mi to set x to true under any contingency.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Thus, given an arena {a mathematical formula}A=(N, Φ ,m1, … ,mn), a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i=(Qi,qi0, Δ i, Τ i) for module {a mathematical formula}mi is consistent with{a mathematical formula}mi if the following two conditions are satisfied:</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">for the initial state {a mathematical formula}qi0, we have {a mathematical formula} Τ i(qi0)=execi(g,v ⊥ ) for some {a mathematical formula}g ∈ I1× … ×In, and</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">If a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i is consistent with module {a mathematical formula}mi, we simply say that {a mathematical formula} Σ i is a strategy for{a mathematical formula}mi.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Given an srml arena {a mathematical formula}A=(N, Φ ,m1, … ,mn), we say that a strategy profile {a mathematical formula} Σ → =( Σ 1, … , Σ n) is consistent with A if each {a mathematical formula} Σ i is consistent with {a mathematical formula}mi.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">In the remainder of the article, we restrict our attention to consistent strategies, and so from here on, the term “ strategy ” should be understood to mean “ consistent strategy ” .</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Finally, because each strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i is deterministic, there is a unique run induced by {a mathematical formula} Σ → , which we denote by {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( Σ → ).</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Thus, whereas a profile {a mathematical formula} Σ → of deterministic strategies can be associated with a unique and infinite sequence of states/valuations of the system, a profile of non-deterministic strategies can be associated with a unique and infinite tree of system states/valuations – where only the non-deterministic choices made by {a mathematical formula} Σ → are left in the tree.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">In particular, given an arena {a mathematical formula}A=(N, Φ ,m1, … ,mn) and a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i, we can define the Kripke structure and runs induced by {a mathematical formula} Σ i on A by replacing {a mathematical formula}mi with {a mathematical formula}m( Σ i), that is, induced by the semantics of the srml arena {a mathematical formula}A Σ i=(N, Φ ∪ Qi,m1, … ,m( Σ i), … ,mn).</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">The outcome with respect to some {a mathematical formula} Σ → , then, is given by the Kripke structure or runs associated with the srml arena {a mathematical formula}A Σ → =(N, Φ ∪ ⋃ i ∈ NQi,m( Σ 1), … ,m( Σ n)).</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Since we are interested only in the computation runs and trees with respect to Φ associated with both {a mathematical formula}K Σ → and {a mathematical formula}A Σ → , let us write {a mathematical formula}runs(K Σ → )| Φ for the restriction with respect to Φ , that is for the set {a mathematical formula}{ Ρ | Φ : Ρ ∈ runs(K Σ → )}, and similarly for the set of computation trees.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Proposition 10</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Next, we ask whether a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium: {a mathematical formula} Note that the strategies {a mathematical formula} Σ → =( Σ 1, … , Σ n) given in the input to this problem are represented as finite state machines.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">We assume that they are represented by explicitly enumerating the various components of the finite state machine.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">NE-membershipfor LTL RMGs is PSPACE-complete.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">In addition, it is PSPACE-hard even for one-player games and LTL goals over a singleton variable set Φ .</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">The next problem asks if a game has any Nash equilibrium.</a>
