<a href="#0" id="0">The set of all assumptions in (the support of arguments hold of) the P nodes in {a mathematical formula}Ta is called the defence set of {a mathematical formula}Ta.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An abstract dispute tree {a mathematical formula}Ta is admissible iff no culprit in the argument of an O labelling node in {a mathematical formula}Ta belongs to the defence set of {a mathematical formula}Ta.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The defence set of an admissible abstract dispute tree for an argument A (in {a mathematical formula}F) is admissible (Theorem 5.1 in [14]), and thus A as well as the sentence in the root node of A is admissible (in {a mathematical formula}F).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An abstract dispute tree is ideal iff for no O node N in the tree there exists an admissible abstract dispute tree with root N (in {a mathematical formula}F).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The defence set of an ideal abstract dispute tree for an argument is ideal (Theorem 3.4 in [15]), and thus A as well as the sentence in the root node of A is ideal (in {a mathematical formula}F).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We assume the agents share a common logical language {a mathematical formula}L and a (non-empty, possibly infinite) set {a mathematical formula}ID that:</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our definition of turn-making function is very liberal, in that it states that {a mathematical formula}ai starts {a mathematical formula}Dajai( Χ ) and all subsequent utterances are made by any of the agents as dictated by Γ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consider dialogue Δ :{a mathematical formula} Here, there is no connection between contents of utterances and their targets, e.g., there is no connection between the rule {a mathematical formula}p ← q and the sentence s, and between the assumption a and the sentence s. The dialogue is not a-successful (and thus not g- and i-successful) as indeed s is not even supported by an argument in {a mathematical formula}F Δ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Indeed, in addition to being an ABA dialogue (as we have seen in Section 5.1), Δ is compatible with a (top – down) related legal-move function Λ as all regular utterances are related; and it is Λ -exhaustive as there is no utterance {a mathematical formula}u ′ related to any existing utterance with content an assumption, rule or contrary already in {a mathematical formula}F Δ = 〈 L,R Δ ,A Δ ,C Δ 〉 (see Section 5.1) that can be added to Δ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Given a dialogue{a mathematical formula} Δ ∈ D, for each actual argument{a mathematical formula}S ⊢ t Β drawn from the debate tree{a mathematical formula}T( Δ ), there exists an ABA argument{a mathematical formula}S ⊢ Β in the ABA framework drawn from Δ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The ABA arguments corresponding to actual arguments drawn from the debate tree drawn from the dialogue in Example 3.2 (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">the defence set{a mathematical formula}DEF(T( Δ )) is the union of all assumptions Α in proponent nodes of the form {a mathematical formula}N=( Α ,ma:P[_]), such that N is in an actual argument;</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">A debate tree {a mathematical formula}T( Δ ) is ideal iff none of the opponent arguments drawn from {a mathematical formula}T( Δ ) belongs to an admissible set of arguments in the ABA framework {a mathematical formula}F Δ drawn from Δ .The ideal outcome function{a mathematical formula} Ω i is such that, given {a mathematical formula} Δ ∈ D and {a mathematical formula} Λ ∈ Λ , {a mathematical formula} Ω i( Δ , Λ )=true iff {a mathematical formula} Ω cf( Δ , Λ )=true and {a mathematical formula}T( Δ ) is ideal.A Λ -ideal dialogue is a Λ -conflict-free dialogue {a mathematical formula} Δ ∈ D such that {a mathematical formula} Ω i( Δ , Λ )=true.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This is partly because {a mathematical formula} Ω cf is defined with respect to properties of debate trees rather than debate forest (see Definition 9.4).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We show, given a dialogue Δ , that this inductive process constructs a debate tree {a mathematical formula}T( Δ ) as in Definition 8.1.Condition 1(a) and 1(b) in Definition 8.1 are trivially true since nodes in {a mathematical formula}T0( Δ ), … ,Tm( Δ ) are nodes inserted in accordance with utterances in Δ hence, if a sentence Β is in a node, then Β must be in some utterance in the dialogue.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Since Δ is ideal, by Definition 10.3 we know that none of the opponent arguments drawn from {a mathematical formula}T( Δ ) belongs to an admissible set of arguments in {a mathematical formula}F Δ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We now show {a mathematical formula} Δ i is compatible with a related {a mathematical formula} Λ i ∈ Λ and that {a mathematical formula} Ω ex( Δ i, Λ i)=true.By Definition 8.1, we know that, in a debate tree, there are 6 ways in which two nodes N and {a mathematical formula}N ′ can be connected (N is the parent of {a mathematical formula}N ′ ):</a>
