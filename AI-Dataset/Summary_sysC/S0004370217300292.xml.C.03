<a href="#0" id="0">Here, the notation {a mathematical formula}(pj ′ ,p − j) is used to represent the price vector where all vendors besides j use the prices in p and vendor j has deviated to price {a mathematical formula}pj ′ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is smaller than the utility the vendor would have by selecting a price of {a mathematical formula}vn and attracting only the buyers of type n (the remaining buyers simply abstain).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider an equilibrium {a mathematical formula}(x,p) of a price competition game.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">So, by moving all buyers of type i from vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ to vendor j, we still have an assignment that is consistent to p in which the utilities of buyers and vendors do not change.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We denote by {a mathematical formula} Η (i) the vendor where the buyers of type i are assigned in x.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Also, we denote by {a mathematical formula}o(i) the vendor to which the buyers of type i are assigned in an optimal assignment.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We claim that this price vector together with the consistent assignment x that assigns the buyers to vendor {a mathematical formula}j ⁎ is an equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consider the price competition game {a mathematical formula}G shown in Table 2.Let x be the assignment where all buyers of type A are assigned to vendor 1, all buyers of type B are assigned to vendor 4, buyers of type C are assigned to 2, buyers of type D are assigned to vendor 1 and, finally, buyers of type E are assigned to vendor 3.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since {a mathematical formula}(x,q¯) is not an equilibrium, there must exist some i such that buyers of type i are assigned to a vendor j in x and satisfy {a mathematical formula}vij ′ − q¯j ′ >vij − q¯j for some vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ that is empty in x.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For a leaf vendor j of {a mathematical formula}H ′ , its price may satisfy {a mathematical formula}q¯j=cj only if there is a buyer type i assigned to j in x and another vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ so that {a mathematical formula}vij − q¯j=vij ′ − q¯j ′ , as otherwise j could negligibly increase its price and obtain more utility.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Again, there is a buyer type i assigned to {a mathematical formula}j ⁎ in x and another vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ so that {a mathematical formula}vij ⁎ − q¯j ⁎ =vij ′ − q¯j ′ , as, otherwise, vendor {a mathematical formula}j ⁎ could increase its price above its production cost and increase its utility.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">But then, {a mathematical formula}j ′ can negligibly decrease its price to attract (in addition to all the buyers it gets in x) the buyers assigned to {a mathematical formula}j ⁎ as well; this would increase the utility of vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Then, the only reason that may prevent vendor j from increasing its price is that there is a buyer of type i assigned to j in x and another vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ such that {a mathematical formula}vij − q¯j=vij ′ − q¯j ′ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Then, the only reason that may prevent vendor j from increasing its price is that there is a buyer of type i assigned to j in x and another vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ such that {a mathematical formula}vij − q¯j=vij ′ − q¯j ′ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Then, vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ could negligibly decrease its price to attract (in addition to the buyers it gets in x) the buyers assigned to j as well; this would increase the utility of vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">To see that, consider an equilibrium {a mathematical formula}(x,p) where buyers of some type i are split between two vendors j and {a mathematical formula}j ′ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Then, it must be {a mathematical formula}pj=cj and {a mathematical formula}pj ′ =cj ′ , and the assignment in which all these buyers are assigned to vendor j without changing the prices is still an equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Then, by negligibly decreasing its price in q, vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ could increase its utility by attracting (in addition to the buyers it gets in x) all the buyers of type i.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The right vendor may attract all buyers and the amount of subsidies in it is at least {a mathematical formula}6 − 2pr.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In such a case, the vendor will also attract the buyers of type {a mathematical formula}be as well.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Also, vendor j can attract buyers of type {a mathematical formula}bj ⁎ (from vendor {a mathematical formula}j ⁎ ) by deviating to a price {a mathematical formula}pj ′ that satisfies {a mathematical formula}k+2 − pj ′ ≥ k+3 − pj ⁎ ; this price can be up to {a mathematical formula}pj ⁎ − 1.</a>
