<a href="#0" id="0">Consider the problem CSP{a mathematical formula}((Q;<)) where < is the binary order relation of the set {a mathematical formula}Q of rational numbers.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note, however, that for the definition of the problem {a mathematical formula}CSP( Γ ) we do not need to explicitly represent solutions since we only have to decide the existence of solutions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Other ways of representing {a mathematical formula}Df are possible (such as solution sets of equations) but they are outside the scope of this article.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A first-order Τ -formula {a mathematical formula} Φ (x1, … ,xn) is called existential if it is of the form{a mathematical formula} where Ψ is a quantifier-free first-order formula.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A subset of positive and existential formulas is of particular interest to us: a first-order Τ -formula {a mathematical formula} Φ (x1, … ,xn) is called primitive positive if it is of the form{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1, … , Ψ l are atomic Τ -formulas, i.e., formulas of the form</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The problem CSP{a mathematical formula}( Γ ′ ) is trivially in P since every instance {a mathematical formula}(V,C) is satisfied by assigning the value 0 to each variable.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We will next show that the problem CSP{a mathematical formula}( Γ ′ ∪ Nc) is, on the other hand, {a mathematical formula}C-hard.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We can thus find examples of {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ such that CSP{a mathematical formula}( Γ ′ ) and CSP{a mathematical formula}( Γ ′ ∪ Nc) are arbitrarily far separated.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To verify that CSP{a mathematical formula}( Γ ′ ∪ Nc) is {a mathematical formula}C-hard, we present a polynomial-time reduction from CSP( Γ ) to CSP{a mathematical formula}( Γ ′ ∪ {{1}}).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let {a mathematical formula}(V,C) denote an arbitrary instance of CSP( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We say that G is a permutation group if the identity permutation is in G and for arbitrary {a mathematical formula}g,f ∈ G, the functions {a mathematical formula}x ↦ g(f(x)) and {a mathematical formula}x ↦ g − 1(x) are also in G. In other words, G is closed under function composition and inversion.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We begin with the structure {a mathematical formula}(Q;<), that is, the rational numbers with the usual linear ordering relation.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This implies that {a mathematical formula} Α (s ′ (x)) restricted to the set V is a solution to I.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Arbitrarily choose such a language Γ and assume (without loss of generality due to Theorem 4) that {a mathematical formula}< ∈ Γ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The reader may be puzzled about the restriction to constraint languages containing the relation {a mathematical formula}m. Intuitively, {a mathematical formula}m allows us to define certain relations that make endpoints identical and such relations are the very basis of the dichotomy result (see the construction in the beginning of Lemma 22).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Every relation in {a mathematical formula}H can be rewritten in a similar way; we let {a mathematical formula}H ′ denote the resulting constraint language.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The problem of applying Theorem 18 directly to Allen relations stems from the different domains: the theorem is concerned with the domain {a mathematical formula}Q while Allen relations are defined over the interval domain {a mathematical formula}I.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Note that if {a mathematical formula}x,y are a pair, then every solution must assign a strictly higher value to y than to x.Based on {a mathematical formula}(V,C), we define an instance {a mathematical formula}(V ′ ,C ′ ) of CSP( Γ ) as follows.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Note that the exact choice of function g for defining {a mathematical formula}f(x) is irrelevant: whenever we have interval variables, say, {a mathematical formula}Ix,y and {a mathematical formula}Ix,z, then {a mathematical formula}f ′ (Ix,y)=[a,b] and {a mathematical formula}f ′ (Ix,z)=[a,c], due to the constraints introduced in steps 2 – 5 in the reduction.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Γ is homogeneous, andthe domain elements are represented in a way such that given two elements{a mathematical formula}a,b ∈ D, it is possible to find (by using an algorithm A) the unique{a mathematical formula}Bi,{a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≤ k, such that{a mathematical formula}(a,b) ∈ Biin polynomial time (measured in the size of the representations of a and b).Then, CSP</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We exemplify the result by taking a look at Allen's algebra with domain {a mathematical formula}I. Hirsch [33] has shown that {a mathematical formula}A ∨ = is a homogeneous structure and the second precondition of Theorem 27 is clearly satisfied with the given representation.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">If {a mathematical formula}Dc ′ is a finite set of constant relations, then the relations between the corresponding domain elements can be computed in advance.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Another example is relations R defined by linear expressions, that is, R is defined by{a mathematical formula} or{a mathematical formula} where the coefficients are in {a mathematical formula}Z and the variables range over, for instance, {a mathematical formula}Q or {a mathematical formula}Z.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Given a constraint language Γ containing such relations, the small solution property for {a mathematical formula}Q follows from the fact that linear programming can be solved (and a concrete solution written down) in polynomial time while the property for {a mathematical formula}Z has been proven by Papadimitriou [57].</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">By using the same idea as we used for proving that temporal constraints have the small solution property, it follows that if an instance {a mathematical formula}(V,C) of CSP( Γ ) has a solution, then it has a solution {a mathematical formula}s:V → {1, … ,|V|} and Γ has the small solution property.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Now, let{a mathematical formula} If u is PP-connected with some variable v and {a mathematical formula}U(v) ∈ C ′ , then we know that {a mathematical formula}|s ′ (u)|<T for any solution {a mathematical formula}s ′ to {a mathematical formula}I ′ .We prove that at most {a mathematical formula}|V ′ | ⋅ T different elements are needed for representing a solution by induction over the number of variables in {a mathematical formula}V ′ .</a>
