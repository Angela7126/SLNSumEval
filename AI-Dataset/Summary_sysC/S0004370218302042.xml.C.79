<a href="#0" id="0">[2], [1], [3]) focused on the complexity of problems involving pure equilibria, where it was shown that determining whether a pure strategy equilibrium exists is {a mathematical formula} Î£ 2p-complete, but the complexity can be lower if the players' goal formulae are restricted to a tractable fragment of propositional logic.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We define the following formulae, which are true if Player One names an index outside of the local square named by Player Two:{a mathematical formula} This gives us the complete description of the game:{a mathematical formula} We now claim that the existence of an accepting run of M on w in at most K steps is equivalent to the existence of an equilibrium in the game described where Player Two is guaranteed utility:{a mathematical formula} Suppose an accepting run exists.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can thus restrict ourselves to equilibria of this form, as no other equilibria can give Player Two a utility of at least {a mathematical formula}v[2].If Player One is playing all {a mathematical formula}(i,j) with non-zero probability, then by Lemma 3.4 there must exist some {a mathematical formula}(i,j) that does not satisfy Valid, and hence Player Two cannot attain {a mathematical formula}v[2] utility.</a>
