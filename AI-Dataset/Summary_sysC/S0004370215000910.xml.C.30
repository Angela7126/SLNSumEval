<a href="#0" id="0">We will first in Section 2 review uses of logic in modelling reasoning with legal rules (whether from statutes or case law), assuming that the facts of a case match the rules' conditions and that the law is drafted so as to enforce a unique outcome in each case.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Section 3 we review logical models of legal reasoning about legal rules in light of the facts of a case.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Subtopics here are dealing with reasons not to apply an applicable statutory rule and with the interpretation of legal concepts as they appear in the conditions of legal rules.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our review in this section will have special emphasis on argumentation-based approaches.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Section 4 we discuss models of reasoning to establish the facts of a case, that is, models of rational legal proof.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Here we will contrast argumentation-based with narrative and Bayesian approaches and address the logical nature of burdens of proof and presumptions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, in Section 5 we review formal accounts of the interaction between the participants in legal procedures.</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">In the next section we review this work on logical models of legal argument.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Much work reviewed in this section uses Dung's [51] notion of an abstract argumentation framework (AF), which is a pair {a mathematical formula}(A,D), where {a mathematical formula}A is a set of arguments and {a mathematical formula}D ⊆ A×A is a binary relation of defeat[51].</a>

<a href="#17" id="17">Consider a ‘ case base ’ with just one case, with pro-decision factors {a mathematical formula}f1 and {a mathematical formula}f2 and con-decision factors {a mathematical formula}d1 and {a mathematical formula}d2.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">{a mathematical formula}r1: {a mathematical formula}f1,f2 ⇒ Decision</a>

<a href="#26" id="26">Interestingly, Horty can account for the fact that following a precedent sometimes changes the law.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Consider again the new case and the single precedent 1.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Both following and distinguishing the precedent is allowed but once the precedent is followed, the new case becomes a precedent for subsequent cases and deciding a new case with the same factors {a mathematical formula}f1,d2,d3 con the decision becomes an overruling, since its preference {a mathematical formula}r4>r3 is now inconsistent with {a mathematical formula}r3>r4.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Inspired by [99] and [7], we generalised CATO's case representation method in [135] to collections of multi-steps arguments for and against conclusions, where rule priorities are expressed for each pair of conflicting rules, and we allowed that any rule or priority of a precedent is used in a new case.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Semiformally: unpack your opponent's use of {a mathematical formula}A ⇒ B as {a mathematical formula}A ⇒ C, {a mathematical formula}C ⇒ B and state an argument for ¬C.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Assume by way of illustration a case rule {a mathematical formula}B ∧ C ⇒ A, which compresses the adjudication between the following three arguments (for notational convenience we use specificity to express the comparison of the arguments).</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">{a mathematical formula}Arg1: B, {a mathematical formula}B ⇒ A, so A</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">{a mathematical formula}Arg2: C, {a mathematical formula}C ⇒ D, {a mathematical formula}D ⇒ ¬A, so ¬A</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">{a mathematical formula}Arg3: {a mathematical formula}B,C, {a mathematical formula}B ⇒ F, {a mathematical formula}F ∧ C ⇒ ¬D, so ¬D</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">O: Your rule compresses the adjudication between three arguments, so:{a mathematical formula}Argument record={Arg1,Arg2,Arg3}</a>

<a href="#42" id="42">In [24] they applied it to reasoning with precedents, representing the Keeble case as follows (note that they equate circumstances S and goal G):{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Here both Arg1 and Arg3 and Arg2 and Arg3 attack each other.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">To explain the decision in Keeble, the values of protection of property and the economy should both individually be preferred to the value of legal certainty, so that Arg3 is defeated by both Arg1 and Arg2.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">{a mathematical formula} We now list the various arguments that can be constructed.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Until 2000 there was not much work in law & logic and AI & law on legal proof but then AI & law researchers [172], [40], [127] began to model the neo-Wigmorean approach in terms of logical frameworks for argumentation.</a>
