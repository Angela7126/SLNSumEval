<a href="#0" id="0">A balanced decomposition should supply predictive capabilities to planning as well as to acting.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Both may perform look-ahead operations, with various planning techniques.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is important to keep in mind that planning and acting may work in distinct state spaces and action spaces.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, they may both use the same representation and possibly a unified model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One may characterize ideas and approaches for specifying deliberation models for planning and acting into the following categories:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Single model approaches rely on a unified domain model merging the know-what specification of descriptive models and the know-how specification of operational models.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Abstraction and hierarchical methods are the usual tools for decomposing the problem.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Planning is performed down to some level of abstraction.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Abstract actions in plans are further refined into primitive commands.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Techniques such as Hierarchical Task Networks, Angelic Hierarchical Planning, or Hierarchical MDPs may support these approaches.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Multiple model approaches use distinct models: an abstract descriptive model for planning and one or several operational models for acting to refine each plan step into skills.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">These approaches may use either (i) a uniform knowledge representation for specifying planning and acting problems at different levels of granularity, e.g., formal action languages, or (ii) heterogeneous knowledge representations at various levels, e.g., precondition – effect operators for planning, procedures or rules for acting.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Simulation and sampling: “ precondition – effect ” representation of actions tends to be shallow.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Simulation systems of robots and environments, when available, can be used to achieve reliable predictions, in particular with sampling techniques.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This is illustrated in the integration of motion planning to task planning, e.g., [33], [4], in probabilistic planning techniques, and in reinforcement learning (Section 7.2).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In addition to space, time plays an important role in planning; it allows for concurrent activities and synchronization.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Most of the task planners in our analyzed systems take into account time, often with an explicit representation with state variables over timelines.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Constraint programming and plan space search are also quite popular in reviewed systems.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">As we will see next, they offer some advantages in the integration of planning and acting and in plan repair.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Model-based approaches are effective for the proprioceptive monitoring of the internal state of a robot in safety critical applications.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Techniques demonstrated in space can probably be extended to self-driving cars and similar applications (column (vi) in Table 1).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">However, they are not sufficient for supporting robust deliberative behavior in complex changing environments.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Monitoring requires a close link to and an extension of planning and acting domain knowledge in order to express conditions to be monitored while carrying out a plan.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The state of the art illustrates a few systems implementing monitoring functions where the knowledge representation link is addressed at the most abstract planning level.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">More work is required for a consistent integration of monitoring and acting.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">The design of appropriate knowledge representations for planning and acting should integrate as early as possible the requirements of monitoring.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Finally, a high degree of autonomy over long term missions requires a goal reasoning capability, a form of monitoring at the most abstract level.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Few robotic systems have reached a level which requires extending monitoring with assessment and resolution of conflicting decisions.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The state of the art for the acquisition of deliberation models remains very preliminary.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">We discussed a few approaches for acquiring semantic maps and integrating the learned knowledge into planning and acting models.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">These and similar approaches are strongly needed in service and domestic robots and other applications with similar features (see Table 1).</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">We also discussed a few Reinforcement learning and Learning from Demonstration approaches which appear as promising research direction that have not yet been developed at the deliberation level in robotics.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Most analyzed systems address three main functions: planning, acting and monitoring.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">It is interesting to note that, in most of these systems, planning explicitly takes into account space and time.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">The former is mandatory for a mobile robot, but of particular cases, e.g., a spacecraft.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">There is however a significant difference between embedding a motion planner in a system's architecture, as a GenoM module in [3] or in the WITAS system [61], and integrating motion and task features in the search and state spaces of planning, as done in Asymov [36] and other systems discussed in Section 3.1.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">The latter option can properly handle interdependences between space configurations and other task properties.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">With the growing interest in the tight coupling of motion and task planning, one can expect to see their integration more prevalent in robotic deliberation systems.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Most planners in the analyzed systems handle time and concurrency.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">These are indeed important features which allows for simultaneous activities and synchronization with events in dynamic environments.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Some systems deploy a temporal planning approach (e.g., IxTeT, RAX-PS, EUROPA, Aspen, TALPlanner) with state variables over timelines, while others have a narrower management of time as a resource (e.g., Cypress), or as a timed behavior extension to Hierarchical Constraint Automata for RMPL, and timeline management in XFRM.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">The simpler and more efficient state space task planning approaches are very relevant in many applications; it is unclear whether they can replace temporal planning altogether.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Probabilistic and other nondeterministic planners have, for the moment, a narrower use, mostly at the sensory-motor level, e.g., within reinforcement learning approaches.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">Their integration in deliberation system will certainly be developed, in particular at the acting level.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">Finally, the predictive capability of the models in most of the surveyed planners remains quite narrow and limited.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">One should expect significant progress from simulation-based planning, e.g., with sampling search and receding horizon techniques.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Monitoring is the third function common to most analyzed systems.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">The link between planning and monitoring knowledge is well advanced.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">In a few cases, both rely on the same knowledge representation, e.g., Temporal Action Logic in the WITAS/TALPlan approach or Temporal Plan Networks in the RMPL system.</a>
