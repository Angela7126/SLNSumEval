<a href="#0" id="0">We note that for {a mathematical formula}n=2, if an assignment satisfies envy-freeness for particular cardinal utilities, it satisfies proportionality for those cardinal utilities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, if an assignment is SD proportional, it satisfies proportionality for all cardinal utilities, hence it satisfies envy-freeness for all cardinal utilities and hence it satisfies SD envy-freeness.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Weak SD proportionality and possible envy-freeness are equivalent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By Theorem 3(iii), possible envy-freeness implies weak SD proportionality.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If an assignment satisfies weak SD proportionality, then there exist cardinal utilities consistent with the ordinal preferences for which proportionality is satisfied.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence for {a mathematical formula}n=2, there exist cardinal utilities consistent with the ordinal preferences for which envy-freeness is satisfied, which means that the assignment satisfies possible envy-freeness.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Weak SD envy-freeness and weak SD proportionality are equivalent.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We have already shown that weak SD proportionality implies possible envy-freeness for {a mathematical formula}n=2, and that possible envy-freeness implies weak SD envy-freeness.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Therefore, it is sufficient to prove that weak SD envy-freeness implies weak SD proportionality.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Assume that an assignment p is not weak SD proportional.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then, there exists at least one agent {a mathematical formula}i ∈ {1,2} such that{a mathematical formula} for all {a mathematical formula}k ∈ {1, … ,ki} and{a mathematical formula} for some {a mathematical formula}k ∈ {1, … ,ki}.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">But this implies that{a mathematical formula} for all {a mathematical formula}k ∈ {1, … ,ki} and{a mathematical formula} for some {a mathematical formula}k ∈ {1, … ,ki}.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Thus {a mathematical formula}p( − i) ≻ iSDp(i) and hence p is not weak SD envy-free.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">An optimal proportional assignment can be computed in polynomial time even if agents are allowed to express indifference between objects.If there exists no assignment in which each agent gets one of his most preferred objects, then {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ is infinite.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This means the first proportionality constraint of agents cannot be simultaneously satisfied for a finite {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In that case any arbitrary assignment satisfies optimality proportionality with {a mathematical formula} Α ⁎ = ∞ .</a>
