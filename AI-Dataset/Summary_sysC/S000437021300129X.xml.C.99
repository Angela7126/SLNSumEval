<a href="#0" id="0">Note that an agent may expect different (even infinitely many) potential observations to happen at a given state, for example, she may expect {a mathematical formula}a … ab to happen for any finite sequence of as preceding the terminating action b.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As human beings and computers are essentially finite, we need to denote such expectations in a finitary way.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To make the link more precise, we can relate POL on epistemic expectation models to the same language on epistemic temporal models with the usual PDL-style interpretation of {a mathematical formula}[ Π ] Φ formulas, as we now proceed to show.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Intuitively, we associate to each protocol Η a set {a mathematical formula}Lg( Η ) of guarded observations in the form of{a mathematical formula} where each {a mathematical formula} Ρ i ⊆ P denotes a state of affairs (the atomic propositions {a mathematical formula}p ∈ Ρ are true while the others are false), encoding the conditions for the later observations to happen.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The scenario is modeled as follows, where the last model is the epistemic expectation model resulting from the update of the protocol on the first epistemic model:{a mathematical formula} Here, g denotes the fact that ‘ Kate is gay ’ , a denotes the observation of Kate making the ‘ musical statement ’ and b stands for Kate saying something else.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the following epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}M; we will show that {a mathematical formula}M cannot be generated by any epistemic protocol on its epistemic skeleton:{a mathematical formula}Suppose towards contradiction that there is a protocol model {a mathematical formula}A such that the execution of {a mathematical formula}A on the epistemic skeleton of {a mathematical formula}M gives an epistemic expectation model that is bisimilar to {a mathematical formula}M. To compose {a mathematical formula}s ′ in the epistemic expectation model, we need a state t in the protocol model such that {a mathematical formula}Prot(t) allows a to happen if p is true.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It can be generated from its epistemic skeleton by updating with the public protocol {a mathematical formula}?p ⋅ b+?¬p ⋅ a or with the epistemic protocol model:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Actually, on arbitrary epistemic models, the announcement of {a mathematical formula}?p ⋅ b+?¬p ⋅ a will always yield the same result as the above epistemic protocol model.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">On the other hand, the announcement {a mathematical formula}?p ⋅ (a+b) gives a different update result on the same epistemic model compared to the update with the following epistemic protocol:{a mathematical formula} Such examples suggest a notion of equivalence between protocol models.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We need to show for any epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}M that: {a mathematical formula}M ⊗ A ↔ ̲ oM ⊗ B.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We define a binary relation between {a mathematical formula}M ⊗ A and {a mathematical formula}M ⊗ B as {a mathematical formula}(w,s)R(v,t) ⇔ w=v,sEt and {a mathematical formula}Exp((w,s))=Exp((v,t)).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Whenever {a mathematical formula}(w,s) ∈ M ⊗ A, {a mathematical formula}(w,t) ∈ M ⊗ B for some {a mathematical formula}t ∈ B.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This happens due to the fact that {a mathematical formula}A ≈ B, and the epistemic relations in each model are reflexive.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Thus we have that the definition of R is both sound and total.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Recalling the meaning of the modal product operation, the expression ‘ {a mathematical formula}[!Ae] Φ ’ therefore stands for ‘ after installing the new epistemic protocol {a mathematical formula}Ae, the formula Φ is true ’ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As an example, let us give the model of Example 1 from the introduction, the epistemic expectation model induced by the epistemic protocol (modelled on p. 27, call it {a mathematical formula}Ae), and the updated model according to observation a (in the picture, visualized by {a mathematical formula}|a):{a mathematical formula} Recall the original model {a mathematical formula}M:{a mathematical formula} Now we can verify for the actual state s:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We say that a set of fact-changing actions {a mathematical formula}( Σ , Ι ) is equivalent to a Σ -factual change system {a mathematical formula}(Q,r) if for any {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Σ and any {a mathematical formula} Ρ , Ρ ′ ⊆ P the following holds:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">As a reminder, for each {a mathematical formula} Ρ ⊆ P, we write {a mathematical formula} Φ Ρ as the abbreviation of the characteristic formula (see Definition 17).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Finally, we are ready to prove an analogue of Proposition 18: there is a normal form of guarded regular expressions with respect to an fc-system {a mathematical formula}F in which tests only appear at the beginning.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">To this end we first introduce fact-changing epistemic expectation models and protocol models, {a mathematical formula}MexpF and {a mathematical formula}AF, given by {a mathematical formula} 〈 Mexp,F 〉 and {a mathematical formula} 〈 A,F 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}Mexp is an epistemic expectation model, {a mathematical formula}A is a protocol model and {a mathematical formula}F is a factual change system.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Now we can verify the following:{a mathematical formula} Formally, one needs first to convert {a mathematical formula} Η 1 with respect to {a mathematical formula}FLB into the corresponding normal form using the guarded automata construction of Proposition 41, and then construct the epistemic expectation model {a mathematical formula}M ⊗ Η 1FLB according to Definition 42, and finally check the truth value of the remaining {a mathematical formula}[! Η 1FLB]-free formula on this model.</a>
