<a href="#0" id="0">Over the past decade, a considerable body of work has shown how to use supervised machine learning methods to build regression models that provide approximate answers to this question based on given algorithm performance data; we survey this work in Section 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the same community, Howe and co-authors [45], [97] used linear regression to predict how both a planner ʼ s runtime and its probability of success depend on various features of the planning problem; they also applied these predictions to decide, on a per-instance basis, which of a finite set of algorithms should be run in order to optimize a performance objective such as expected runtime.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">More specifically, we show how to extend all models to handle categorical inputs (required for predictions in partially categorical configuration spaces) and describe two new model families well-suited to modelling the performance of highly parameterized algorithms based on potentially large amounts of data: the projected process approximation to Gaussian processes and random forests of regression trees.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For some applications such expensive features will be reasonable — in particular, we note that for applications that take features as a one-time input, but build models repeatedly, it can even make sense to use features whose cost exceeds that of solving the instance; examples of such applications include model-based algorithm configuration [55] and complex empirical analyses based on performance predictions [53], [57].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{sup:10} In practice, the small improvements in predictive performance that can be obtained via hyperparameter optimization appear likely not to justify this drastic increase in computational cost (e.g., consider model-based algorithm configuration procedures, which iterate between model construction and data gathering, constructing thousands of models during typical algorithm configuration runs [55]).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, we evaluate model performance based on fixed default hyperparameters in the rest of this article.</a>
