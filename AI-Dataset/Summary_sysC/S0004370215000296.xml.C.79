<a href="#1" id="1">Second, we extend compilation approaches developed for temporally flexible execution of discrete activity plans to work with hybrid discrete/continuous systems using a recently developed Linear Quadratic Regulator synthesis algorithm, which performs a state reachability analysis to prune infeasible trajectories, and which determines optimal control policies for feasible state regions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">During the planning phase, a single, nominal reference trajectory for the robot's joints is generated taking into account constraints and optimization criteria [6].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">At each control time increment, the algorithm runs such an optimization, resulting in an optimal sequence of control actions and states over the extent of the horizon.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The key innovations include: 1) the use of a sampling algorithm, RRT, which was originally developed for robot motion planning, to explore the state space; 2) a search heuristic that biases growth of the RRT tree towards the unsafe set; 3) metrics that provide information about the completeness of the search, which can be used to obtain a probabilistic certificate of validation; and 4) an extension of RRT called “ Recursively Refined RRT ” , which uses progressively smaller time steps to improve the resolution of the RRT tree.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Temporally Feasible ActivityGiven an activity and associated plant, the activity is Temporally Feasible in the duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u] if{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This states that the set of plant feasible trajectories includes ones that go from {a mathematical formula}Rinit to {a mathematical formula}Rgoal over the entire duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">More specifically, if a trajectory starting anywhere in the initial region, {a mathematical formula}Rinit, of the activity (see Definition 8) and ending somewhere in the goal region, {a mathematical formula}Rgoal, at any duration d such that {a mathematical formula}l ≤ d ≤ u, is Plant Feasible, then the activity is temporally feasible in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Temporally Controllable ActivityGiven an activity and associated plant, and given a Valid Control Policy, P, for the activity, the activity is Temporally Controllable by P in the duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u] if the activity is Temporally Feasible in this range, and if all trajectories for the activity are consistent with (generated by) P. A trajectory is consistent with, or generated by P if for every state {a mathematical formula}x(k) in the trajectory, the subsequent state {a mathematical formula}x(k+1) results from applying P to {a mathematical formula}x(k).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In order to support efficient execution, the flow tube representation must allow the dispatcher to: 1) quickly determine whether a feasible state trajectory exists from the current state, and 2) if such a trajectory exists, what the control commands should be (based on a control policy) that achieve the trajectory.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, each linear control law of a valid cross section has the property that application of the control input to the linearized sub-system moves the state of this sub-system into the region of the cross section of the next time increment closer to the goal, if there are no disturbances.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If the result is a flow tube with no valid cross sections, then the algorithm stops and indicates an error; the QSP is infeasible.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If the flow tube is non-empty (has valid cross sections), then these cross sections are feasible in terms of plant dynamics, but not necessarily other aspects of the QSP.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">However, unlike discrete activity systems, which can simply set the occurrence of events so that they coincide with target completion times, our dispatcher must generate control inputs that guide the hybrid plant to its goal state at the target completion time.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Temporally Controllable Activity for Target Completion Time and Current StateAn activity is Temporally Controllable for Target Completion Time {a mathematical formula}tf from current state x if there exists a Valid Control Policy for Target Completion Time, {a mathematical formula}P(tf), that covers x.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We call this a Valid Control Policy for Target Completion Time and State, and denote this by {a mathematical formula}P(tf,x).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Given the current state,x, and a valid cross section,{a mathematical formula}cd, of a currently executing Control Activity that started executing at time{a mathematical formula}ts, where{a mathematical formula}Rsis the state-space region for{a mathematical formula}cd, and D is the duration to the goal for{a mathematical formula}cd(seeDefinition 18), if{a mathematical formula}x ∈ Rsand{a mathematical formula}tf − ts=D, then{a mathematical formula}P(tf,x)exists, and is achieved by{a mathematical formula}cd.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Given the current state,x, and a set of valid cross sections of a currently executing Control Activity that started executing at time{a mathematical formula}ts, then for each cross section{a mathematical formula}cd, if{a mathematical formula}cdrepresents{a mathematical formula}P(tf,x)according toLemma 4, and if the set of cross sections is contiguous, then the activity is temporally controllable in the duration range{a mathematical formula}[l,u], where l is the minimum duration in the set, and u is the maximum.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In reality, given that the cross sections are inner approximations, it will sometimes be possible for the physical system to achieve the goal without change in target completion time, because the state is in the actual reach set, but not the approximation.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The concept of a target completion time represents a key distinction between our system, and the discrete activity execution systems discussed in Section 2.1.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The function UpdateControlInputs iterates over each activity info in runtime activity state, and computes new plant control inputs by accessing flow tube cross section policies based on the remaining execution time for the activity.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">13 shows two sets of trajectories, one nominal, starting from an initial state of {a mathematical formula}x=[ − 0.2,1.0,0,0], and one corresponding to a push disturbance in the backward direction, starting from an initial state of {a mathematical formula}x=[ − 0.3,1.0,0,0].</a>
