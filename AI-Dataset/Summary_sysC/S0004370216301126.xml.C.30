<a href="#0" id="0">By Theorem 1, any sequence of IR deals must converge to an efficient state, independently from the specific payment scheme in use.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we are using the Knaster payment scheme, any state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) reached during negotiation will satisfy {a mathematical formula} Π (i)=exi(A) − Ex(A)/n for each agent i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, we are bound to converge to a state {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ) with an efficient allocation {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ where {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (i)=exi(A ⁎ ) − Ex(A ⁎ )/n.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">But how many deals do we require to reach a social optimum?</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, observe that by Lemma 3, it is always possible to reach the optimum using (at most) one deal, i.e., 1 is a (tight) upper bound on the shortest path.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Much more interesting in practice, however, is the longest path, i.e., the longest sequence of IR deals that agents may end up agreeing on before convergence.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For convergence to an efficient allocation by means of IR deals, {a mathematical formula}nm − 1, with n being the number of agents and m being the number of goods, is known to be a (tight) upper bound on the longest path, i.e., there exist profiles of valuation functions and initial allocations such that it is possible to visit all allocations before convergence [29].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Path length to a proportional stateWe can find a valuation function for each agent and an initial allocation such that there exists a sequence of IR deals with Knaster payments that will achieve proportionality only after exactly{a mathematical formula}nm − 1deals.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Take a scenario where the agents have the valuation functions used in the proof of Lemma 6, except that {a mathematical formula}vn(G) is set to such a high value that the only way of achieving a proportional state is to give all goods to agent n (because no payments the other agents would be prepared to make could be large enough to give utility {a mathematical formula}vn(G)/n to agent n).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">First, observe that under the payment scheme of Theorem 8, which is characterised by Inequality (2), the envy-freeness condition {a mathematical formula}ui(A(i), Π (i)) ⩾ ui(A(j), Π (j)) is equivalent to the following inequality (which must hold for any two agents i and j):{a mathematical formula} To prove the claim of the theorem, we give an example with two agents and two goods, where Inequality (3) fails to be satisfied for the unique efficient allocation.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Take {a mathematical formula}v1 to be any non-supermodular valuation function defined over two goods {a mathematical formula}g1 and {a mathematical formula}g2; that is{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}d>0.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Now we construct a second valuation function {a mathematical formula}v2, which will be modular (so it certainly also will be supermodular), as follows:{a mathematical formula} But now, in a scenario with two agents with these two valuation functions, the (only) efficient allocation is to give good {a mathematical formula}g1 to agent 1 and good {a mathematical formula}g2 to agent 2, yielding a social welfare of {a mathematical formula}v1({g1})+v1({g2}) − d/3.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Proof</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Suppose the agents have the valuation functions defined in the proof of Lemma 6 and initially allocate all goods to agent 1.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Then agents 1 and 2 can go through all {a mathematical formula}2m allocations that divide all goods between the two of them and end up in the allocation where agent 2 owns all items (that is, there are {a mathematical formula}2m − 1 IR deals between them).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We can do the same for every one of the {a mathematical formula}n − 1 pairs {a mathematical formula}(i,i+1) of connected agents and thus end up with a path of the claimed length of {a mathematical formula}(2m − 1) ⋅ (n − 1) deals.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Such a weaker axiom would allow us to distinguish, say, a situation where {a mathematical formula}n − 1 agents all envy the nth agent from a situation where the same {a mathematical formula}n − 1 agents all envy a different agent, which may be useful in some circumstances.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">This is why we have required initial payments for our convergence results.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Indeed, as the following example shows, without initial payments, there can be negotiation states such that no IR deal would allow us to eliminate envy.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Consider a scenario with two agents and one good:{a mathematical formula} Suppose agent 1 holds g in the initial allocation {a mathematical formula}A0.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">There is only a single possible deal, which amounts to passing g to agent 2, and which will result in the efficient allocation {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">How should payments be arranged?</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">To ensure that the deal is IR for both agents, agent 2 should pay agent 1 any amount in the open interval {a mathematical formula}(4,7).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">On the other hand, to ensure that the final state is envy-free, agent 2 should pay any amount in the closed interval {a mathematical formula}[2,3.5].</a>
