<a href="#1" id="1">The coalition structure generation problem is to find an optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ ∈ Π A, i.e., an (arbitrary) element of the set{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">According to Corollary 7, given a subset of movements M, {a mathematical formula}DPM finds an optimal coalition structure if and only if {a mathematical formula}RM{A}= Π A.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We will now identify a “ small ” set of movements M for which this is the case.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Recall that, given two coalitions {a mathematical formula}C ′ ,C ″ ∈ CA, we write {a mathematical formula}C ′ <C ″ if and only if {a mathematical formula}C ′ precedes {a mathematical formula}C ″ lexicographically.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{sup:6} Set{a mathematical formula} It turns out that, to find an optimal partition, it suffices to consider the movements in {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Every movement {a mathematical formula}mC ′ ,C ″ ∈ M ⁎ with {a mathematical formula}C ′ ∪ C ″ =A leads to exactly one coalition structure, namely {a mathematical formula}{C ′ ,C ″ }, which is in {a mathematical formula} Π 2A.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Similarly, every coalition structure {a mathematical formula}{C1,C2} ∈ Π 2A is reachable via exactly one movement in {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ , namely {a mathematical formula}mC1,C2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between {a mathematical formula} Π 2A and {a mathematical formula}{mC ′ ,C ″ ∈ M ⁎ :C ′ ∪ C ″ =A}.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">5.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Compute the value of {a mathematical formula}{C1,C2} ∪ ai ∈ A ∖ (C1 ∪ C2){{ai}} — the only coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π I5A that contains {a mathematical formula}C1 and {a mathematical formula}C2.</a>
