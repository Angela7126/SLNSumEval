<a href="#1" id="1">If the actual satisfaction probability Δ provided by a policy tree {a mathematical formula}T with respect to constraint h in {a mathematical formula}P is exactly equal to {a mathematical formula} Β − Θ , Τ takes value 1 with probability {a mathematical formula}1 − Α .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each of these two assignments provides a satisfaction probability of exactly {a mathematical formula} Β − Θ with respect to constraint c in the original problem {a mathematical formula}P. From the discussion in Section 4 it follows that each of these two assignments is recognised as infeasible with probability Α if {a mathematical formula}N=290.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An {a mathematical formula}( Α , Θ )-solution set to an SCSP {a mathematical formula}P is a set of policy trees.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">All policy trees in this set simultaneously provide, with probability at least Α , a satisfaction probability greater than or equal to {a mathematical formula} Β i − Θ for every chance constraint {a mathematical formula}hi in {a mathematical formula}P with satisfaction threshold {a mathematical formula} Β i.</a>
