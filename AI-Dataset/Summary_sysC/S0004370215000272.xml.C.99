<a href="#0" id="0">In his axiom system, to better understand the relationship between O and K, he interprets {a mathematical formula}O Α to syntactically denote {a mathematical formula}K Α ∧ N¬ Α using a new modal operator N. Here, {a mathematical formula}N¬ Α is to be read as “ at most Α is known, ” which can be contrasted with the usual {a mathematical formula}K Α that, in fact, could be read as “ at least Α is known ” since {a mathematical formula}K Α does not preclude {a mathematical formula}K( Α ∧ Β ) from holding, in general.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, both {a mathematical formula}K Α ⊃ KK Α and {a mathematical formula}¬N Α ⊃ N¬N Α are valid sentences in {a mathematical formula}OL.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As we mentioned earlier, for the propositional case the semantics can be understood in terms of the following proof theory:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, Lakemeyer's approach is based on a {a mathematical formula}K45ncanonical model, which is a Kripke structure whose worlds are all maximally consistent (wrt the axioms of the modal logic {a mathematical formula}K45n) subsets of basic formulas (cf.Definition 20).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Now since epistemic notions are defined wrt the depth of formulas, the set of conceivable states of depth {a mathematical formula}k+1 is {a mathematical formula}Ek+1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If{a mathematical formula} Φ 1, … , Φ lare{a mathematical formula}K45n-consistent basic i-objective formulas then there exists a basic i-objective formula Ψ of the form{a mathematical formula}Kj Ψ ′ for{a mathematical formula}j ≠ ithat is independent of{a mathematical formula} Φ 1, … , Φ lwrt{a mathematical formula}K45n.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Essentially, it is shown that if {a mathematical formula} Φ z, {a mathematical formula}z ≥ 1, are i-objective formulas of maximal j-depth k, then a formula Ψ of the form {a mathematical formula}(KjKi)k+1p for any proposition p is independent of {a mathematical formula} Φ z,z ≥ 1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It is sufficient to prove that every {a mathematical formula}AXn-consistent formula Α is satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let Γ be a basic A-objective formula independent (wrt {a mathematical formula}K45n) of all formulas in {a mathematical formula} Γ A, which exists by way of Lemma 28.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Since the formulas in {a mathematical formula} Γ A are of maximal B-depth k, then note that such a Γ by way of the construction from Lemma 28 is of B-depth {a mathematical formula}2k+2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, it is not possible to prove this formula using {a mathematical formula}AXn[12, see Theorem 4.7].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore {a mathematical formula}AXn is not complete for formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLn.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The validity of the non-provable formula {a mathematical formula}¬Oi¬Ojp ∈ OLn wrt the canonical model approach demonstrates in a similar spirit that {a mathematical formula}AXn is also not a complete axiomatization in that approach.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To illustrate that {a mathematical formula}AXnt is also complete for formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLnt, we will use ideas similar to that considered in Theorem 30.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore it is necessary to ensure that Lemma 28 and Lemma 29 also hold for non-basic formulas:</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Further, by the definition of {a mathematical formula}OLnt, {a mathematical formula} Φ iz, Ψ iz ∈ OLnt − 1.The remainder of the proof uses formal ideas similar to the ones used in Theorem 30, the only exception being that we do not restrict our attention to basic formulas.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">More precisely, we show that this proposal and our framework agree on provable formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLn.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The (basic) belief set of a k-structure {a mathematical formula}eAk is the set of formulas{a mathematical formula} The notion is analogous for a j-structure {a mathematical formula}eBj.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Suppose{a mathematical formula}eAkis any structure and{a mathematical formula}e+is the maximal structure corresponding to{a mathematical formula}eAk.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Then for any basic formula Α (of appropriate depth):{a mathematical formula}for any{a mathematical formula}eBjand w. (Analogously stated for epistemic states for B and their corresponding maximal structures.)</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">For formulas of the form {a mathematical formula}KB Α , the argument is trivial because we have the same epistemic state for B.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Suppose{a mathematical formula}eAkis any structure and{a mathematical formula}e+is the maximal structure corresponding to{a mathematical formula}eAk.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Let {a mathematical formula}e+ be a maximal structure corresponding to {a mathematical formula}eAk, i.e.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">{a mathematical formula}e+ ≠ eAk.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">By Corollary 54, {a mathematical formula}e+ and {a mathematical formula}eAk must agree on all basic beliefs.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">But because {a mathematical formula}e+ ≠ eAk, there is a basic formula Β such that {a mathematical formula}eAk,{},w ⊨ KA Β and for some {a mathematical formula}(w ′ ,e) ∈ e+ − eAk, we have {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w ′ ⊨ Β .</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">But by the definition of only knowing, {a mathematical formula}eAk,e,w ′ ⊭ Α .</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">This implies {a mathematical formula}eAk and {a mathematical formula}e+ do not agree on basic beliefs, which is a contradiction.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">For every basic Α of maximal A-depth k:{a mathematical formula}An analogous result holds for B.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The notion of minimal knowledge from [2] is very similar in spirit to (propositional) {a mathematical formula}OL, especially when the two proposals are restricted to objective knowledge bases.</a>
