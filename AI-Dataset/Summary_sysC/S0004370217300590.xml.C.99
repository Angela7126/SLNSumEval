<a href="#0" id="0">The criterion (15) has the following properties: (1) it is scale invariant, and does not require any extra trade-off parameter due to its multiplicative form; (2) the first term measures the closeness between S and {a mathematical formula}S0, which is related to unsupervised structures of kernel matrix; the second term measures the closeness between {a mathematical formula}ElSEl ⊤ and {a mathematical formula}Kl ⁎ , which is related to side information; therefore the criterion is consistent with the objective (7) but is numerically different; (3) a higher alignment (second term in (15)) indicates existence of a good predictor with higher probability [16]; (4) computation of the criterion does not require any extra validation set, which is convenient if only limited labeled samples are available.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, Snelson and Ghahramani [19] proposed a smooth joint optimization framework to find the locations of a small, active set of point locations (also called “ pseudo-inputs ” ) and kernel/noise parameters, which can significantly reduce the computational cost of Gaussian process regression to {a mathematical formula}O(m2n) where m is the number of pseudo-inputs and n is the sample size.</a>
