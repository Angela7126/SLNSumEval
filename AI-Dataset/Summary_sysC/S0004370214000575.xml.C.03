<a href="#0" id="0">In the fully cooperative case, the agents are interested in the sum of the individual expected utilities, hence the optimal joint search strategy is the overall-expected-utility-maximizing strategy.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The optimal strategy for the fully cooperative case may dictate that some of the agents should not engage in search at all.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, consider the case of k fully cooperative agents where each agent may explore only a single opportunity (i.e., {a mathematical formula}n=1).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">1 depicts the effect of agent's search cost (left) and the number of opportunities (right) available for search on the agents' individual expected utility for different number of agents taking part in the search.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is because when the search cost is relatively small, it is best that all agents engage in search, in order to fully exploit the {a mathematical formula}k ⋅ n opportunities that can be explored in parallel.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A decrease in the search cost of some of the agents that engage in search according to the optimal strategy necessarily increases the overall expected utility.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We first prove that regardless of the strategies used by the other agents the best-response search strategy for agent {a mathematical formula}Ai, if it chooses to actively engage in search, is a reservation value {a mathematical formula}ri, where {a mathematical formula}ri is the solution to (11).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If agent {a mathematical formula}Ai chooses to engage in search then its expected utility, denoted {a mathematical formula}EBi(search), is given by (13).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The number of agents in {a mathematical formula}Kj ′ (v) decreases as v increases, because the expected improvement due to further search decreases, for the increased v value, whereas the cost of such further search does not change.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's strategy can thus be represented as the mapping {a mathematical formula}S(v,j) → pij(v), where {a mathematical formula}pij(v) is the probability that {a mathematical formula}Ai will choose to explore an additional opportunity when the number of remaining allowed searches is j and the best value obtained so far by all agents is v. We use {a mathematical formula}EBij(v) to denote the expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai if it follows the optimal search strategy, given the strategies used by the other agents, with j search opportunities remaining, and the best value obtained through all the agents' searches so far is v.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">These enable us to calculate the expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai when there are j search periods remaining, given the best value v obtained so far by any of the agents and the search strategies of the other agents {a mathematical formula}{pwj(v)|w ≠ i}.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If the agent opts to not search during the next search period, its expected utility, denoted {a mathematical formula}EBij(¬search,v), is:{a mathematical formula} Eq.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">(22) includes the search cost of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai in the coming search period.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The second term is the expected utility from reaching the next search period when the best value known is the maximum between the value found by the agent itself in the current search period, the best value returned by the other agents in the current search period (associated with a distribution {a mathematical formula}f¯ij(x)), and the best value obtained by all the agents in former {a mathematical formula}n − j periods.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Consequently, the value of {a mathematical formula}EBij(v) is calculated as:{a mathematical formula} The expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai in the joint search is thus given by {a mathematical formula}EBin( − ∞ ).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">2 depicts the individual expected utility of the agents, in equilibrium, in a self-interested-agents setting, as a function of the number of agents k. The setting used for this example considers a search horizon of three search periods ({a mathematical formula}n=3) and the search cost is {a mathematical formula}c=0.1.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Consider a setting where three self-interested agents search jointly, when the search cost is {a mathematical formula}c=0.2 and the search horizon is {a mathematical formula}n=10.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">4 depicts the individual expected utility of two homogeneous agents {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}A2, associated with an equal search cost {a mathematical formula}c1=c2=0.2, when a third agent with a search cost c (given as the horizontal axis) is added.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">It is notable that in this case the expected utility of the different agents do not depend on the cost c (which is relevant only to the third agent) since the agent engaged in search is one of the two homogeneous agents.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In this example the agents would prefer that an agent associated with a search cost of {a mathematical formula}c=0.15 join the search over a more competent agent (e.g., one associated with a search cost of {a mathematical formula}c=0.1).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Consider the case of two-agents with a search horizon of {a mathematical formula}n=1.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Agent {a mathematical formula}A1 can explore an opportunity that yields either 10 or 1 with an equal probability and is associated with a search cost {a mathematical formula}c1=2.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Agent {a mathematical formula}A2 can explore an opportunity that yields either 1 or 1.1 with an equal probability and is associated with a search cost {a mathematical formula}c1=3.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The setting uses three agents and the search cost is 0.1 (i.e., {a mathematical formula}k=3 and {a mathematical formula}c=0.1).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Therefore, for each given number of remaining search periods {a mathematical formula}n ′ , the optimal individual search strategy of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai can be characterized by the reservation value {a mathematical formula}rin ′ such that the agent should resume the search if the best value obtained so far is below {a mathematical formula}rin ′ and otherwise it should terminate the individual search process.We begin with the case of {a mathematical formula}n ′ =1.</a>
