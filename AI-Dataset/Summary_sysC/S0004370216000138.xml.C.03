<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}G be the domain of graphs equipped with a probability notion, such that we can model a concept of interest C using an associated probability distribution P.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A “ generator ” {a mathematical formula}M Θ is defined as:{a mathematical formula} that is {a mathematical formula}M Θ is a procedure that given a set of graphs G in input, returns the set of all the graphs for which the relation {a mathematical formula}R Θ holds true with at least one element of G.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The main difficulty in solving the constructive learning problem rests on 1) the generator {a mathematical formula}M Θ , which can be viewed as a procedure to obtain a set of instances, and 2) its optimization, which is a procedure to adapt the probability distribution of the output instances to a desired shape.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We model the proposal probability distribution using a “ graph grammar ” (see Section 3.1.3) and the acceptance probability distribution using the probability estimator {a mathematical formula}fG0.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The proposed system for CLP is therefore composed of: 1) a MH sampler with a graph grammar and 2) probability estimators {a mathematical formula}fG0(G),fG Θ (G).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) consists of two sets: the vertex set V and the edge set {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ V×V.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given a set of graphs {a mathematical formula}G, a graph {a mathematical formula}CRv(G) is said to be a corresponding core of an interface {a mathematical formula}IR,Tv(G) when the graph induced by the union graph of {a mathematical formula}CRv(G) and {a mathematical formula}IR,Tv(G) is a subgraph of at least one {a mathematical formula}G ∈ G.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A graph grammar [38] is a finite set of productions; a production is a triple {a mathematical formula}S=(M,D,E) where M is the “ mother ” graph, D is the “ daughter ” graph and E is an embedding mechanism.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Starting from each graph in the seed set (line 8), we apply the Metropolis – Hastings algorithm where the proposal distribution {a mathematical formula}g(x → x ′ ) is defined using the substitutability principle, i.e.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The Metropolis – Hastings procedure considers a sample graph G and the new proposal {a mathematical formula}G ′ obtained by the proposal distribution {a mathematical formula}g(G → G ′ ).</a>
