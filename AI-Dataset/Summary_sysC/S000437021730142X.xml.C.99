<a href="#0" id="0">Our framework treats a crucial part of the blending process, namely the generalisation of input concepts, as a search problem that is solved by means of modern answer set programming methods to find commonalities among input concepts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An inherent computational problem of conceptual blending is to find a common ground, called generic space, between the two input concepts [27].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These are (i) the input spaces that are to be blended, (ii) a partial cross-space mapping that connects counterparts in the input mental spaces, (iii) a generic space that is an abstraction from what the input spaces have in common, (iv) a blending operation that produces a blend of the input spaces and into which the structure of the input spaces is selectively projected, and (v) an emergent structure, i.e., structure that is a synergistic gain to the naive sum of the structure of input spaces.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, contrary to a naive view of meaning, there is no fixed understanding of the concepts of house and boat: there are mental spaces for house and boat that are constructed in particular linguistic situations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, one cannot assume that input mental spaces are the same in all possible output blends, since the content of a mental space is neither constant nor preexisting to the context in which they are used.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since {a mathematical formula}liveIn_ride is commonalised, it carries the information of both input spaces and it should therefore also have the joint priority of both input elements, as implemented by summing up the priorities of the corresponding operators liveIn and ride in the input spaces (see Definition 5).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The issue of how blends are to be evaluated is an important one in the theory of conceptual blending, and in addition to these evaluation metrics, which are generic for any kind of blends, more domain specific criteria can (and eventually should) be added to the blending framework.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For this reason we have also explored how different audiences and their respective values can be brought into the blend evaluation process [12] and we have proposed evaluation techniques that draw from argumentation theory [9] and coherence theory [75].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the mathematics domain, we present a general approach for using blending to exploit existing creative lemmas in a well understood theory, to automatically generate creative lemmas in another less understood theory.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The general theory of a group in mathematics is the combination of a set of elements {a mathematical formula}G and a binary operation ∼ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A group {a mathematical formula}(G, ∼ ) has the following axioms:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Extending the notion of group to a cyclic group, involves restricting the set of elements to be finite, and to introduce the notion of a generator element.</a>
