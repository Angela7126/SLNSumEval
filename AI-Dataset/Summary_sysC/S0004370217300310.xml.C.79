<a href="#0" id="0">This special issue brings together the state of the art and practice of the emergent field of integrated AI and Robotics, and highlights the key areas along which this current evolution of machine intelligence is heading.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the face of this growing interest, we lack a clearly defined field of integrated AI and Robotics, which articulates methods, representations and mechanisms that lead to enablement, while laying out challenges and solutions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">They need to be familiar with the methods and limitations in the two fields, to do work across their traditional boundaries, and to combine theoretical insights from both areas with practical understanding of physical robotic systems while converging towards a common lingua-franca.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is our hope that it will constitute an important stepping stone in building a community of AI and Robotics researchers working across their traditional boundaries towards an ultimately shared scientific goal, thus setting the stage for a new science of integrated AI and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The disconnect with real world problem solving in turn led the community down a variety of paths which have had little long-term impact; a case in point are the Planning competitions,{sup:1} where there is substantial algorithmic overfitting to the rules of the competition, while much remains to be desired in terms of the connect to real-world problem solving.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Sensor fusion, SLAM, machine learning, and to some extent automated planning, for instance, are now considered mature sub-fields of the two communities with significant bodies of work and wide applicability.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We claim that most of these factors have a common origin: Robots operate in a closed loop with the physical environment, and must necessarily deal with aspects like strict timing, continuous values, complex dependencies and uncertainty; but tools and techniques developed in AI often assume those aspects away.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Each cell at the intersection of a cognitive ability and a robotic challenge can host a family of open research questions: how to extend the existing AI techniques that implement that ability, so that they can cope with that challenge.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">While difficult to point to a precise cause, one possible explanation is that integrated AI and Robotics work is indeed going on within the Americas, but perhaps mostly in the commercial realm where there are substantially fewer incentives to publish in peer-reviewed publications.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{sup:6} The 18 contributions to this special issue illustrate how AI methods and techniques addressing a given cognitive ability can be extended to address some of our four robotic challenges.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Finally, [11] identifies key decisional issues for robots that cooperate with humans, including needed cognitive skills: situation assessment based on perspective-taking and affordance analysis; acquisition and representation of knowledge models for humans and robots, each with their specificities; situated, natural and multi-modal dialogue; human-aware task planning; human â€“ robot joint task achievement.</a>
