<a href="#0" id="0">We establish these results by means of program transposition — a novel polynomial transformation in which the rules of a given Disjunctive Datalog program {a mathematical formula}P are inverted by moving all IDB atoms between head and body while at the same time replacing their corresponding predicates with relevant auxiliary predicates of higher arity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The rest of this section is devoted to showing that {a mathematical formula} Ξ M(P) is indeed a Datalog rewriting of a Disjunctive Datalog program {a mathematical formula}P whenever M is a marking of {a mathematical formula}P. The correctness argument is similar in structure to the proof of Theorem 3 but it is more involved, as it requires a separate treatment for the auxiliary predicates depending on whether or not the relevant base predicate is marked.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:7} By Theorem 9, {a mathematical formula}O ∪ D ⊨ Α iff {a mathematical formula}P ∪ D ⊨ Α Θ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, it suffices to show that the evaluation of {a mathematical formula}P over {a mathematical formula}D can be computed in polynomial time in the size of {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}D. First, {a mathematical formula}P is of size at most quadratic in the size of {a mathematical formula}O, and the arity of a predicate in {a mathematical formula}P is at most double the arity of a predicate in {a mathematical formula}O.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A common source of such problematic rules are constraints of the form {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ A(x) → ⊥ where Φ is a conjunction of Horn atoms mentioning variable x and A is marked.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Such rules are rewritten to {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ ⊥ ‾ P(y → ) → A ‾ P(x,y → ) for every predicate P, where the extension of {a mathematical formula} ⊥ ‾ P is determined by the rule {a mathematical formula}Pu(x → ) → ⊥ ‾ P(x → ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, the extension of {a mathematical formula}A ‾ P in {a mathematical formula} Ξ Mu(P) ∪ D is populated by the Cartesian product of the extension of Φ and the extension of {a mathematical formula}Pu.</a>
