<a href="#0" id="0">Similarly, we cannot start {a mathematical formula}b2 within {a mathematical formula}(t+l,t+u] because there is no guarantee that {a mathematical formula}p2 will be T during {a mathematical formula}(t+l,t+u] (this is because a may take the maximum duration u and thus {a mathematical formula}e3 that sets {a mathematical formula}p2=T will not happen until {a mathematical formula}t+u).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, compiling away disjunctive conditions as in temporal planning leads to incompleteness (some valid plans cannot be found) when actions with uncontrollable duration are present.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For this reason, it is important to explicitly model disjunctive conditions in our language.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Building a strong plan Σ from a strong schedule for the TNU is analogous to the plain temporal planning case: each pair of corresponding {a mathematical formula} 〈 siast,sjaet 〉 ∈ Χ is a step of Σ , the time for the step is {a mathematical formula} Μ (siast) and, if a is controllable, the duration is {a mathematical formula} Μ (sjaet) − Μ (sjast).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In our running example, reported in Section 3.2, the TO approach can terminate yielding the strong plan {a mathematical formula} Π ex when the following abstract plan is generated by the classical planner and the relative total order is considered.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula} This very same example of an abstract plan that works for finding the plan {a mathematical formula} Π ex also works in the other approaches in this section.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As an example of the approach incompleteness, consider the situation depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For this abstract plan, the Total Order approach would construct an STNU that is not strongly controllable (nor Consistent) because the {a mathematical formula}visible:=T TIL must happen before the {a mathematical formula}hot:=F one.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this section, we present our compilation technique, which can be used to reduce any planning instance P having duration uncertainty into a temporal planning instance {a mathematical formula}P ′ in which all actions have controllable durations.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The first step is to identify the set of variables {a mathematical formula}L ⊆ V that appear as effects of uncontrollable actions and are executed at a time depending on the end of the action.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">If some variables are uncertain, then the condition must be satisfied by all the possible values of the variables at time t. In our rewriting, we know that at each time the value of an uncertain variable f in the original problem is uncertain between the value of f and the value of {a mathematical formula}f Σ in the rewritten problem.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">So, we must ensure that a condition is valid for every possible combination of both the f value and the {a mathematical formula}f Σ value, and Θ produces a set of conditions that exactly ensures this property.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Specifically, we first fix the maximal duration u as the only allowed duration for {a mathematical formula}a ′ and then add appropriate effects and conditions during the action to capture the uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The effects {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ are partitioned in two sets {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ l and {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ u to capture possible values within the uncertain action execution duration.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let {a mathematical formula}t= ˙ eta − Δ be the time of an at-end effect that affects the value of f. In order to prevent other actions from changing the value of f during the interval {a mathematical formula}( Λ (t), Ν (t)] where the value of f is uncertain, we add a condition in {a mathematical formula}Ca ′ E to maintain the value of {a mathematical formula}f Σ throughout the uncertain duration {a mathematical formula}( Λ (t), Ν (t)].</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula} Since the effect on {a mathematical formula}f Σ (belonging to {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ l) is applied at time {a mathematical formula} Λ (t), the condition is satisfied immediately after the effect and we want to avoid concurrent modifications of either f or {a mathematical formula}f Σ until the uncertainty interval ends at {a mathematical formula} Ν (t).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In fact, a plan starting the move action at time 1 would be valid in the simplified problem, but it does not yield a strong plan because the uncontrollable action {a mathematical formula}move could end at time 11 and the ending condition {a mathematical formula} 〈 [etmove]hot=F 〉 would be unsatisfied.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For this reason, the {a mathematical formula}move action cannot be simplified to its maximal duration.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Let Π be a strong plan for P. {a mathematical formula} Σ Π is a valid temporal plan for R because:</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">It achieves the goal {a mathematical formula}G ′ of R, because all the original goals in G are achieved by Π and by Σ in the same way, and the goals on the shadow variables must be achieved because Π is a strong plan.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In fact, Π achieves the goals regardless of the concrete durations of the actions, therefore it achieves them outside of the uncertainty intervals, where the variables and the shadow variables are aligned because of Lemma 3.Each action {a mathematical formula}a ′ is executable in R, because each {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Π is executable in P regardless of the action durations.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Thus the possible uncertainty introduced by the durations is irrelevant for the executability of a (all the conditions are satisfied and variables and the shadow variables are aligned because of Lemma 3).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In the translated instance R, all the conditions are also satisfied because the conditions are imposed via the Χ function that only checks that both the variable and its shadow fulfill the original condition.No conflicting effects are possible because of the conditions added in {a mathematical formula}Ca ′ E that prevents any modification of the interested shadow variables during the uncertainty intervals.Similarly, let</a>
