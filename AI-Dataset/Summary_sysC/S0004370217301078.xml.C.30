<a href="#0" id="0">[30]) we would get arguments such as we should cooperate to promote M1 which would be challenged with objections such as but player 2 might defect which would demote M1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Now if M1 is the most important value for Player 1, then the objection will succeed, unless cooperation can be assumed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If M1 is the only value considered, defection is dominant, giving a better outcome whatever the other player chooses.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Only if other values are considered will Player 1 choose cooperation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, M2 might be rated as highly as M1 (perhaps Player 2 is Player 1's child, or a close colleague), or a clear conscience is regarded as more important than money, in which case Guilt must be considered.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The arguments as modelled in [30] are, however, really for a particular transition (joint action), with the agent's own action justified in virtue of the appearance of that action in the desired transition: the objections are available because other joint actions contain the same individual action for the agent concerned.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Better would be an argument for the individual action itself, not the joint action and its corresponding transition.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This will require us to look at the set of transitions containing the action.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the Ultimatum Game suppose that {a mathematical formula}prob(jointaction) is the probability of jointaction being performed when the agent making the argument chooses some particular individual action.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Now the values will be expected to be promoted and demoted according to the probability of the second player's response, as shown in Table 3, and so the expected utility can be calculated, taking account of the complete set of joint actions that include a particular individual action.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Argument (2) is rather weak: although the expected utility is always positive, the proposed action may have a lower expected utility than the alternative for some (or even all) values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j1).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Joint Action Premise: {a mathematical formula}{j0,j1,...jn} is the set of joint actions in which ag performs Α .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Expected Utility Premise: {a mathematical formula}euag( Α ,prob(j0)) returns the expected utilities of agent ag performing Α for values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j0) where {a mathematical formula}j0 is the desired joint action.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The first premise identifies the values that the agent will consider and the second weights them in terms of the most important value.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The joint actions containing the advocated action Α as the action of ag are then taken from the AATS+V to give the third premise.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The fourth premise then establishes the expected utilities for the various probabilities of the desired joint action, {a mathematical formula}j0, resulting from ag performing Α .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Dominance Premise: {a mathematical formula}euag( Α ,j0) ≥ euag( Β ,j0) for any alternative action Β available to ag, for all values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j0); where {a mathematical formula}j0 is the joint action compliant with the action of ag.</a>
