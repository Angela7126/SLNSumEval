<a href="#0" id="0">M is an answer set (or stable model) of a program P if M is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}PM.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We denote by {a mathematical formula}AS(P) the set of all answer sets of P.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We observe that {a mathematical formula}Horn ⊊ no-BC by again considering the program {a mathematical formula}P3 which belongs to {a mathematical formula}no-BC, but is obviously not Horn, and by considering the fact that all rules r in a Horn program P satisfy {a mathematical formula}|H(r)| ≤ 1 and {a mathematical formula}B − (r)= ∅ which yields that the dependency graph {a mathematical formula}UP contains no bad vertices and hence gives us that {a mathematical formula}UP contains no bad cycles.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However the obtained kernels are not equivalent with respect to the decision of the problems in {a mathematical formula}AspReason, in consequence the kernel cannot be used for backdoor evaluation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the next subsection we consider kernels with respect to problems in {a mathematical formula}AspReason.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Next we consider the problems in {a mathematical formula}AspReason.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We will see that neither of them admits a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the size of a strong {a mathematical formula}C-backdoor for the considered target classes, subject to standard complexity theoretical assumptions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We will show that {a mathematical formula}p ↑ ⪯ q ↑ iff {a mathematical formula}p ⪯ q.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since ≺ and ⋈ can be defined in terms of ⪯ , this shows the claimed observation.Assume {a mathematical formula}p ↑ ⪯ q ↑ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Hence there is a function f such that for all programs P we have {a mathematical formula}p ↑ (P) ≤ f(q ↑ (P)).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In particular, if P is normal we have by Definition 7.3 that {a mathematical formula}p(P)=p ↑ (P) and {a mathematical formula}q(P)=q ↑ (P), hence {a mathematical formula}p(P) ≤ q(P), and so {a mathematical formula}p ⪯ q.Now assume {a mathematical formula}p ⪯ q.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Hence there is a function f such that for all normal programs P we have {a mathematical formula}p(P) ≤ f(q(P)).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}dbCand{a mathematical formula}#neg; and{a mathematical formula}dbCand{a mathematical formula}#non-Hornare incomparable where{a mathematical formula}C ∈ {no-C,no-DC,no-DC2,no-EC,no-DEC}.For a normal program P define the sets {a mathematical formula}B − (P)={a ∈ at(P):a ∈ B − (r) for some rule r ∈ P} and {a mathematical formula}H(P)={a ∈ H(r):r ∈ P,r is not Horn}.</a>
