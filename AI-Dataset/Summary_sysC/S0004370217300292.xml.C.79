<a href="#0" id="0">The utility of vendor j, when the vendors use a price vector p and the buyers are assigned to vendors according to an assignment x that is consistent to p, is defined as{a mathematical formula} Vendors are utility-maximizers.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A price vector p and a consistent assignment x form a (pure Nash) equilibrium when for every vendor j, the price {a mathematical formula}pj maximizes the utility {a mathematical formula}uj(y,(pj ′ ,p − j)) among all prices {a mathematical formula}pj ′ ≥ cj and all assignments y that are consistent to {a mathematical formula}(pj ′ ,p − j).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Here, the notation {a mathematical formula}(pj ′ ,p − j) is used to represent the price vector where all vendors besides j use the prices in p and vendor j has deviated to price {a mathematical formula}pj ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The social welfare of an assignment x is defined as{a mathematical formula} This definition does not require the assignment x to be consistent to a price vector and can be used to define the optimal social welfare as{a mathematical formula} When the assignment x is consistent to a price vector p, the social welfare can be equivalently seen as the total utility of vendors and buyers since{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We denote by {a mathematical formula} Η (i) the vendor where the buyers of type i are assigned in x.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Also, we denote by {a mathematical formula}o(i) the vendor to which the buyers of type i are assigned in an optimal assignment.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Again, if there exists an optimal assignment where buyers of the same type i are split among different vendors, we can move all these buyers to a single vendor without decreasing the social welfare, hence {a mathematical formula}o(i) is well defined.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In order to verify that {a mathematical formula}(x,p) is indeed a pure Nash equilibrium, it suffices to run algorithm Verify with input {a mathematical formula}(x,p); this is true since all buyers are assigned to vendors in their demand set, vendors 1, 2 and 3 cannot increase their utility by unilaterally increasing their price as, then, they would lose all assigned buyers, while vendor 4 cannot increase its price, since its assigned buyers would move to vendor 1, and cannot attract new buyers by decreasing its price.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since {a mathematical formula}(x,q¯) is not an equilibrium, there must exist some i such that buyers of type i are assigned to a vendor j in x and satisfy {a mathematical formula}vij ′ − q¯j ′ >vij − q¯j for some vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ that is empty in x.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">From the definition of {a mathematical formula}q¯, this means that {a mathematical formula}vij ′ − cj ′ >vij − qj and vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ could set its price to a sufficiently small but strictly higher than its production cost price to attract the buyers of type i and increase its utility from 0 (since {a mathematical formula}j ′ is an empty vendor according to x) to positive; this contradicts the assumption that {a mathematical formula}(x,q) is an equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Now, clearly, {a mathematical formula}q¯ has the desired structure (i.e., prices equal to production costs) for vendors that are empty in x, and it suffices to prove that {a mathematical formula}p=q¯.For the remainder of the proof, recall that, by the definition of q, {a mathematical formula}qj=q¯j for any non-empty vendor j.Seed vendors.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}x ˆ , for every node j of G, buyers of type {a mathematical formula}bj are assigned to vendor j, and buyers of type {a mathematical formula}bj ⁎ are assigned to vendor {a mathematical formula}j ⁎ and, for every edge e of G, buyers of type {a mathematical formula}be are assigned to vendor e. We will show that the minimum amount of subsidies required to enforce this optimal assignment as an equilibrium is equal to the size of a minimum node cover of G. We will need the following lemma.Letpbe a price vector to which assignment{a mathematical formula}x ˆ is consistent.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In order to show this, we will start with an arbitrary price vector p to which {a mathematical formula}x ˆ is consistent and will transform it, through a sequence of rounds that will not violate the consistency of {a mathematical formula}x ˆ to prices and will not increase the cost of the corresponding subsidies, to a price vector with the following properties: all edge vendors have prices equal to {a mathematical formula}(k+1)2, auxiliary node vendors have prices equal to {a mathematical formula}k+3, node vendors corresponding to a node cover C of G have prices equal to {a mathematical formula}k+2 while the remaining node vendors have prices equal to {a mathematical formula}k+3.</a>
