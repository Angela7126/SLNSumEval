<a href="#0" id="0">An embedded coalition is a pair, {a mathematical formula}(C,CS), where C is a coalition, and CS is a coalition structure over A that contains C. That is, {a mathematical formula}CS ∈ Π A:C ∈ CS.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The set of all embedded coalitions will be denoted by EC.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The first dynamic programming algorithm for the coalition structure generation problem, called DP, was proposed by Yeh [93].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The DP algorithm depends directly on the following theorem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given a coalition{a mathematical formula}C ⊆ A, let{a mathematical formula}f(C)be the value of an optimal coalition structure over C. That is,{a mathematical formula}f(C)=maxCS ∈ Π C ⁡ V(CS).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given a set of n agents, the dynamic programming algorithm, DP, computes an optimal coalition structure in{a mathematical formula}O(3n)time.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the coalition structure generation version of GRASP, a coalition structure CS is formed iteratively as follows.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">There exists an optimal coalition structure{a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ such that{a mathematical formula} ∀ Ci ∈ CS ⁎ ,(Ci,v(Ci)) ∈ SCG.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Every coalition structure in {a mathematical formula}TCS is the result of merging some (if not all) of the coalitions in CS that are connected via solid edges.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this formalism, the value of a coalition C not only depends on the identities of its members, but also depends on the coalition structure in which C is embedded.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">More formally, as mentioned earlier in Section 2, a partition function game is a pair, {a mathematical formula}(A,w), where A is the set of agents and w is the partition function, which maps each embedded coalition, {a mathematical formula}(C,CS) ∈ EC, to its value, {a mathematical formula}w(C,CS).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Consider a{a mathematical formula}PFG − ({a mathematical formula}PFG+) setting.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For every coalition{a mathematical formula}C ⊆ A, and every partition of C, i.e.,{a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π C, and every{a mathematical formula}CS:P ⊆ CS, the following holds:{a mathematical formula}</a>
