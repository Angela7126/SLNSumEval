<a href="#0" id="0">For any set Σ of tgds, let{a mathematical formula}K Σ be the number of predicates in Σ and let{a mathematical formula}L Σ be the maximum arity of the predicates in Σ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">There exist CQs q and sets Σ of OWL 2 QL-tgds any UCQ-rewritings of which have{a mathematical formula} Ω (K Σ |q|)CQs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Any CQ q and any set Σ of linear tgds without constants have a UCQ-rewriting with{a mathematical formula}O((K Σ ⋅ (L Σ ⋅ |q|)L Σ )|q|)CQs such that the number of atoms in each CQ does not exceed the number of atoms in q.In particular, for OWL 2 QL-tgds Σ ,{a mathematical formula}L Σ ≤ 2and the UCQ-rewriting has{a mathematical formula}O((K Σ ⋅ (2|q|)2)|q|)CQs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Any CQ q and any sticky set Σ of tgds without constants have a UCQ-rewriting with{a mathematical formula}2O(K Σ ⋅ (L Σ ⋅ |q|)L Σ )CQs, each of which has{a mathematical formula}O(K Σ ⋅ (L Σ ⋅ |q|)L Σ )atoms.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, given a family of monotone Boolean functions {a mathematical formula}fn in NP, we first encode them — via the Tseitin transformation [59] — by means of polynomial-size CNFs, which are used to construct a sequence of OWL 2 QL-ontologies {a mathematical formula} Σ fn and Boolean CQs {a mathematical formula}qfn such that{a mathematical formula} where the database instance {a mathematical formula}D Α is determined by Α .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, using the fact that the {a mathematical formula}D Α have a single domain element, we show that if we have, say, PE-rewritings of the {a mathematical formula}qfn and {a mathematical formula} Σ fn, then those rewritings are in essence monotone Boolean formulas (that is, propositional PE-formulas), and so, by the known results on circuit complexity, cannot be polynomial, for example, in the case of the family of Boolean functions that check whether a given graph (encoded by arguments of the functions) contains a clique of the specified size.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If{a mathematical formula}qfn ′ is a PE-rewriting of{a mathematical formula}qfnand{a mathematical formula} Σ fn, then there is a monotone Boolean formula{a mathematical formula} Φ ncomputing{a mathematical formula}fnwith{a mathematical formula}| Φ n| ≤ |qfn ′ |.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We say that a family of ontologies has the polynomial witness property (PWP, for short) if there is a polynomial {a mathematical formula}d(m,n) such that, for any ontology Σ in the family, any CQ {a mathematical formula}q(x) and any data instance D, whenever {a mathematical formula}( Σ ,D) ⊨ q(a), for a tuple a from {a mathematical formula} Δ D, then there is a sequence of {a mathematical formula}d(|q|,| Σ |) applications of tgds from Σ to D that entails {a mathematical formula}q(a) (in the sense that there is a homomorphism from {a mathematical formula}q(a) to the set of atoms generated by those tgd applications).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let{a mathematical formula}q(x)be a CQ and Σ an ontology from a family with the PWP.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">There is a{a mathematical formula}PE{0,1}-rewriting of q and Σ whose size is polynomial in{a mathematical formula}|q|and{a mathematical formula}| Σ |.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">There is an{a mathematical formula}NDL{0,1}-rewriting of q and Σ whose size is polynomial in{a mathematical formula}|q|and{a mathematical formula}| Σ |.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The following result is an immediate consequence of the proof of Theorem 11; we shall use it to prove Lemma 15 in the next section: Let{a mathematical formula}q(x)be a CQ and Σ an ontology from a family with the PWP.</a>
