<a href="#0" id="0">An offer O is a possible offer for a CS and a given {a mathematical formula}SPi player at state s if the following conditions hold:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Intuitively, if the CS player is committed to player {a mathematical formula}SPi in state s, then there is no possible path for the CS player at this state to the goal of the other {a mathematical formula}SPj player, even if the {a mathematical formula}SPj player provides all its chips to the CS player.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore the only way for the CS player to receive the bonus in the game is to reach the goal of the {a mathematical formula}SPi player.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As an example, a commitment offer at the beginning of the game shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">1 is when the {a mathematical formula}SPg proposes to send 33 red chips and 7 purple chips for 11 yellow chips.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As we will show, commitment offers play a key role in the equilibria strategies that are described in the following section.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this board, the CS is independent (has the resources to get to either of the goals at the onset of the game), while the SP players are symmetric (they have the same number of chips and the length of the path to each of their goals is equal).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this game, the preferred offers for the SP and the CS player are commitment offers.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Furthermore, according to the sub-game equilibrium of Theorem 1, both SP players offer their preferred offer, the CS player accepts the offer of the {a mathematical formula}SPg player, and proceeds directly to the goal, thereby ending the game.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For the customer (CS) role, we used an agent termed “ CS-A ” that used the strategy that is described in the equilibrium definition of Theorem 1 while assuming the customer player always reaches the goal (i.e., {a mathematical formula}p=1) after a commitment has been made.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For the service provider (SP) role, we used one of two types of equilibrium agents.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">One agent, termed “ SP-A ” , used the strategy that is described in the equilibrium definition in Theorem 1, while assigning probability {a mathematical formula}p=1 for the customer player reaching the goal.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The {a mathematical formula}SPi preferred offers at the initial state {a mathematical formula}s1, {a mathematical formula}O ˆ 1,i − are defined iteratively.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">At iteration 0, the preferred offer depends on the expected utility {a mathematical formula}Eucs(1,P1 ⁎ ) for the CS player given the preferred path {a mathematical formula}P1 ⁎ .</a>
