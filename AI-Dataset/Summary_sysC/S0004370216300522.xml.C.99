<a href="#0" id="0">In general, the canonical model of a DL-Lite{a mathematical formula}R KB {a mathematical formula}K can be infinite, which makes it impossible to deal with it in practice.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, we define here an alternative notion that is called the generating structure of {a mathematical formula}K. This structure is always finite and can be used for deciding various reasoning tasks efficiently.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Formally, given a simple KB {a mathematical formula}K= 〈 O,A 〉 , the generating structure{a mathematical formula}gen(K)= 〈 Δ gen(K), ⋅ gen(K) 〉 of {a mathematical formula}K, is defined as:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}a ∈ ind(A), A is a concept name, and P is a role name occurring in {a mathematical formula}K. It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}gen(K) is of polynomial size in the size of {a mathematical formula}K. Note that the canonical model {a mathematical formula}uni(K) can be obtained by unraveling [56, Ch.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From the previous examples, we conclude that: There exists a mapping{a mathematical formula}M=( Σ , Γ ,B)and a KB{a mathematical formula}Ks= 〈 S,As 〉 over Σ such that there is no universal solution for{a mathematical formula}Ksunder{a mathematical formula}M(even if extended ABoxes are allowed).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From the previous examples, we conclude that: There exists a mapping{a mathematical formula}M=( Σ , Γ ,B)and a KB{a mathematical formula}Ks= 〈 S,As 〉 over Σ such that, there is no universal solution for{a mathematical formula}Ksunder{a mathematical formula}M, but there exists a universal{a mathematical formula}UCQ-solution for{a mathematical formula}Ksunder{a mathematical formula}M.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Moreover, let {a mathematical formula}Ks= 〈 S,As 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}S={A ⊑ ∃ R, ∃ R − ⊑ ∃ R} and {a mathematical formula}As={A(a),S(a,b)}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then the projection over Γ of the canonical model of {a mathematical formula} 〈 S ∪ B,As 〉 can be depicted as follows:{a mathematical formula} In this case, the basic requirement for a KB {a mathematical formula}Kt= 〈 T,At 〉 to be a universal {a mathematical formula}UCQ-solution for {a mathematical formula}Ks under {a mathematical formula}M is that {a mathematical formula}At contain {a mathematical formula}{ ∃ Q(a),Q(a,b)}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, the approach in Example 5.12 to obtain a universal {a mathematical formula}UCQ-solution cannot work, as having the axiom {a mathematical formula} ∃ Q − ⊑ ∃ Q in {a mathematical formula}T would also make the query {a mathematical formula} ∃ x.Q(b,x) evaluate to true over {a mathematical formula}Kt, while it evaluates to false over {a mathematical formula} 〈 S ∪ B,As 〉 .</a>
