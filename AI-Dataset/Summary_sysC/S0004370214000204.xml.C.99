<a href="#0" id="0">Steady setGiven a CNF theory Π and a model {a mathematical formula}M for Π , the minimal model {a mathematical formula}St ⊆ M of the theory {a mathematical formula} Π M ← nd is called the steady set of {a mathematical formula}M for Π .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First of all, since {a mathematical formula}M is a model of Π , by definition of model all the constraints (aka empty-head clauses) of Π are true in {a mathematical formula}M and are also true in any subset of {a mathematical formula}M. Hence, they can be disregarded during the subsequent steps (see line 1).Moreover, note that, by definition of steady set, it follows that the set {a mathematical formula}St computed at the beginning of each iteration of the algorithm (line 4) is a (not necessarily proper) subset of every minimal model contained in {a mathematical formula}M. Let n be the number of atoms in the model {a mathematical formula}M computed at line 1 of the GEA.Three cases are possible, which are discussed next:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Simplified theoryLet Π be a CNF theory and {a mathematical formula}M be a model of Π .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then the simplified theory of Π w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}M, denoted as {a mathematical formula} Σ M( Π ), is the CNF theory {a mathematical formula}( Σ M( Π ))M ∖ St, where{a mathematical formula} and {a mathematical formula}St is the steady set of {a mathematical formula}M in Π .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The clauses in {a mathematical formula} Σ M( Π ) are those clauses of Π having the body fully contained in {a mathematical formula}M and some atoms of the head contained in {a mathematical formula}M but not in {a mathematical formula}St.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that it cannot be the case for the head of any clause in {a mathematical formula} Σ M( Π ) to have empty intersection with {a mathematical formula}M (or, analogously, the head is empty) since, in such a case, {a mathematical formula}M would not be a model for Π .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Then, intuitively, {a mathematical formula} Σ M( Π ) contains the subset of the clauses of Π which could be falsified if atoms would be eliminated from the model {a mathematical formula}M, so that we would have a model for Π no longer.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that, we do not consider the case that atoms of {a mathematical formula}St are eliminated from {a mathematical formula}M since, by definition of steady set, if any atom of {a mathematical formula}St were eliminated we would have no longer models for Π in {a mathematical formula}M. Simplified theories enjoy two useful properties.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As for the first, we observe that, for any CNF theory Π and model {a mathematical formula}M of Π , {a mathematical formula} Σ M( Π ) is positive.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The second one, summarized in the following lemma, tells that {a mathematical formula} Σ M( Π ) contains no facts.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Then,{a mathematical formula}GEA Ξ HEF( Π ,M)computes, in polynomial time, a minimal model of Π contained in{a mathematical formula}M.Because of Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.2, in order to prove the statement, it is sufficient to show that (i) {a mathematical formula} Ξ HEF returns an erasable set, if such a set exists, and an empty one otherwise (namely that {a mathematical formula} Ξ HEF is, in fact, an eliminating operator) and that (ii) {a mathematical formula} Ξ HEF runs in polynomial time.Let us consider first point (i).</a>
