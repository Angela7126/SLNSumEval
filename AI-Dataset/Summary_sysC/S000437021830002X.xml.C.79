<a href="#0" id="0">In the context of SAT, one often considers structural restrictions on a graphical representation of the formula (such as the primal graph), and the aim is to design efficient fixed-parameter algorithms for SAT, i.e., algorithms running in time {a mathematical formula}O(f(k)nO(1)) where k is the value of the considered structural parameter for the given SAT instance and n is its input size.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If{a mathematical formula}|Z|>#C( ℓ ,k,i,m)+1, then in time{a mathematical formula}O(#C( ℓ ,k,i,m)2 ⋅ m!m)one can compute a subinstance{a mathematical formula}I ′ =(F ′ , Η )of I with strictly less variables and the following property: there exists a solution Α of I of value{a mathematical formula}w= Η ( Α )if and only if there exists a solution{a mathematical formula} Α ′ of{a mathematical formula}I ′ of value w. Moreover, a solution Α can be computed from any solution{a mathematical formula} Α ′ in linear time.</a>
