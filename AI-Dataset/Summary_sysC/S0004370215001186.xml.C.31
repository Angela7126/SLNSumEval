<a href="#0" id="0">In this article, we explore the modelling of opinion dynamics with multiple social networks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We look at how the properties of different network models influence the convergence to opinion consensus.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We present a series of models that use these networks in different ways: which create distinct emergent dynamics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We want to study the consequences of using multiple social networks at the same time while maintaining the interaction model as simple and abstract as possible (following the methodology in most opinion dynamics literature).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We present two models where agents can: interact at the same time in the multiple networks (choosing partners from any network); or switch between networks (choosing only partners from their current network).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also looked at the properties that result from merging scale-free networks (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A.3).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Like the previous results, the properties don't vary much between the 100 different instances.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We can then say that specific configurations display a specific average path length and clustering coefficient both for k-regular networks and scale-free networks.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we look at what happens when we merge k-regular networks with scale-free networks.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We didn't make an exhaustive analysis for this configuration, but we show what is the resulting structure of such merging.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">You can see in Fig.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">7 that this results in a network with a lower average path length due to the shortcuts created by the scale-free network.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">It is also less dense than the structure with two 10-regular networks (Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">2).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We consider only the merging of two networks.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Fig.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">14 shows the average number of encounters during 100 independent simulation runs for scale-free networks.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">(We don't include the configuration for one network and {a mathematical formula}d=1 because these never converge.)</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The convergence ratio is very low for the configurations with one network {a mathematical formula}d=2 and 2 networks with {a mathematical formula}d=1; hence the high number of encounters (see also Table 3).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Fig.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">15 shows the results for the number of encounters necessary for the agents to achieve consensus.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We focus on the k-regular networks with higher values of k. We can see that with these two networks, the configurations with values of {a mathematical formula}d>=2 for scale-free networks produce drastically better results in terms of speed of convergence.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The data for the average number of encounters, as well as the respective standard deviations referent to the results in Fig.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">15, can be found in Appendix B, Table B.3.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">We first look at the influence of the new parameter (switching probability) in the convergence to consensus.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">We span the switching probability between 0 and 1 in intervals of 0.05.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">We do this for 2 networks with k-regular and scale-free topologies.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Fig.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">16 shows the results for two k-regular networks: one configuration with {a mathematical formula}k=10 and one configuration with {a mathematical formula}k=30.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">We use these two configurations to study the relationship between the number of encounters, the switching probability parameter, and the connectivity of the networks.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Remember that with {a mathematical formula}k=30 the average path length is also lower (Section 5.1.1).</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">In this case it is more important (to convergence speed) to switch from the network with lower average path length and a forest-like composition (and a probability of at least the same value or more than the one of the other network with {a mathematical formula}d=5).</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">The same can be observed when we mix k-regular with scale-free networks (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">19).</a>
