<a href="#0" id="0">We prove the surprising result that {a mathematical formula}127645, the length of the longest completely multiplicative sequence of discrepancy 3, is also the maximal length of a multiplicative sequence of discrepancy 3, which is not the case for {a mathematical formula}C=1 and {a mathematical formula}C=2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It can be checked in a similar way that the other possibility of {a mathematical formula}x1 being − 1 also leads to a contradiction.The first eleven elements of the sequence (3) form a discrepancy 1 sequence.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is multiplicative but not completely multiplicative as {a mathematical formula}x9 is − 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Reasoning similar to the one above shows that there exists a unique longest completely multiplicative ±1 sequence of discrepancy 1 which has nine elements:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Cardinality constraints can be encoded by propositional formulae so that every interpretation satisfying the formula satisfies the cardinality constraint and vice versa; a number of such encodings can be found in the literature [38].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As every ±1 sequence whose length does not exceed C is always C-bounded, in what follows we only consider cases of {a mathematical formula}l>C.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Notice that {a mathematical formula}| ∑ i=1jxi| from the definition of C-boundedness above can be characterised as the absolute value of the difference of the number of occurrences of +1 in {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xj and the number of occurrences of − 1 in {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xj.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Under our correspondence, the number of occurrences of +1 in {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xj is the number of occurrences of 1 in {a mathematical formula}a1, … ,aj is {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1jai.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As the total number of elements in {a mathematical formula}x1, … xj is j, the number of occurrences of − 1 in {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xj is the number of occurrences of 0 in {a mathematical formula}a1, … ,aj is {a mathematical formula}(j − ∑ i=1jai).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then{a mathematical formula} Thus {a mathematical formula}a1, … ,al is C-bounded if, and only if,{a mathematical formula} which is equivalent to the two following systems of inequalities,{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} If we interpret now the numerical values 0 and 1 as Boolean constants true and false, respectively, the 0/1 sequence {a mathematical formula}a1, … ,al corresponds to the evaluation of a sequence of Boolean propositions {a mathematical formula}p1, … ,pl under some interpretation I, and C-boundedness of a sequence can be expressed as cardinality constraints in a natural way.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It suffices to notice that {a mathematical formula}| ∑ i=1jai| is odd if, and only if, j is odd.</a>
