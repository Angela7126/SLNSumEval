<a href="#0" id="0">In general, an LTM has n observed variables {a mathematical formula}X={X1, … ,Xn} and m latent variables {a mathematical formula}Z={Z1, … ,Zm}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The model {a mathematical formula}m1 is the model with the highest BIC score among all LTMs with a single latent variable, and the model {a mathematical formula}m2 is the model with the highest BIC score among all LTMs with two latent variables.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We will also need the MI between a variable X and a set of variables {a mathematical formula}S. We estimate it as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then other variables are added to {a mathematical formula}S one by one.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For {a mathematical formula}m2, we choose the model where one latent variable is connected to the variables in {a mathematical formula}S ∖ {W} and the second latent variable connected to W and X.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In {a mathematical formula}m2, shuttle is grouped with the new variable because it has the highest MI with the new variable among all the three variables in Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let m and {a mathematical formula}m ′ be two islands with latent variables Y and {a mathematical formula}Y ′ respectively.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let X and H be respectively the sets of observed and latent variables in an LTM m, and let {a mathematical formula}V=X ∪ H.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Pem-Lcm estimates the distribution by running EM on a part of the model {a mathematical formula}m1 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In our running example, let moon be the variable W that has the highest MI with lunar among all variables in {a mathematical formula}S. Then the model {a mathematical formula}m2 is as shown on the right hand side of Fig.</a>
