<a href="#0" id="0">In addition, we explore the statistical properties of the first method; specifically we show that the proposed method retains the merits of the {a mathematical formula}L0-approach (1) in the sense that the oracle estimator can be reconstructed, which leads to consistent feature selection and parameter estimation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Theorem 1 gives an analytical solution of {a mathematical formula}x ⁎ in an ideal situation when the values of {a mathematical formula} Λ ⁎ and {a mathematical formula} Η ⁎ are given.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Unfortunately, this is not the case and the values of {a mathematical formula} Λ ⁎ and {a mathematical formula} Η ⁎ need to be computed directly from (8).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If only the cardinality constraint is present, the optimal solution of Problem(18)can be obtained by setting the{a mathematical formula}p − s1smallest (in absolute value) elements of v to zero.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The ISTA framework has been shown to possess a convergence rate of {a mathematical formula}O(1/k) for a class of {a mathematical formula} ℓ 1-regularized/constrained optimization problems and can be further improved to {a mathematical formula}O(1/k2) via adding a carefully designed search point [3].</a>
