<a href="#0" id="0">These methods have a common modus operandi to determining the experiment {a mathematical formula} Θ t at time step t: construct a utility function {a mathematical formula}ut based on the posterior GP conditioned on the queries so far; then maximise {a mathematical formula}ut to determine {a mathematical formula} Θ t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The key difference in such methods is essentially in the specification of {a mathematical formula}ut to determine the next experiment.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Uncertainty for the posterior via uncertainty for the log joint: Assume that we have queried the likelihood oracle at n points, and for each query point {a mathematical formula} Θ i the oracle provided us with {a mathematical formula}Li ≈ P(Xobs| Θ i) answers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Equation (3) says that we should choose the point that results in the highest reduction in divergence if we knew the likelihood and the true posterior at that point.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In NED, we choose the point with the highest expected reduction in divergence.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For the next evaluation we choose the point that minimises the expected divergence between these models and the next estimate.</a>
