<a href="#0" id="0">Without loss of generality, in what follows, we assume all the concepts to be in their negation normal forms (NNF){sup:2} and use {a mathematical formula}~C to denote the NNF of ¬C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When only a small number of the concepts can be fully classified by {a mathematical formula}EL axioms alone, its effect on improving reasoning efficiency might not be significant.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Considering the {a mathematical formula}T1 in Example 1, it is easy to derive the following axiom:{a mathematical formula} Given this, it is sufficient to derive the following axiom, in which we use underline to highlight the expressions appearing in the above axiom:{a mathematical formula} Note that this can be achieved by a tractable inference rule:{a mathematical formula} or the combination of two tractable inference rules:{a mathematical formula} Although there are other more complex axioms in {a mathematical formula}T1, such as axiom (4), they are not necessarily required in this step of inference.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Apparently, after transformation we should be able to obtain the following axioms from {a mathematical formula}TPrimate:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}C6=fa( ≥ 4hasLeg.Leg) and {a mathematical formula}C7=fa( ≤ 2hasLeg.Leg).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given the R rules, we define a syntactic notion of nominal-safety: Syntactic nominal-safety under approximate reasoningAn ontology {a mathematical formula}O is syntactic nominal-safe under approximate reasoning if {a mathematical formula}TAfa(O)=(T,CT,QT,IT) satisfies the following syntactic properties, where A is a concept such that A, {a mathematical formula}fc(A) ∈ CNT, {a mathematical formula}B(i) is an arbitrary concept, a and b are individuals and r is a named role:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Similar as Theorem 2, this theorem can be proved by showing that {a mathematical formula}O ∪ O ′ ∪ Tfa conservatively extends both {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}O ′ on {a mathematical formula} Σ O, where {a mathematical formula}Tfa is the set of definition {a mathematical formula}fa(P) ≡ P for all term P of {a mathematical formula}O except complement of roles.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The above theorem shows that when a nominal-free ontology contains no role chains except the role transitivity axioms, its ABox approximate reasoning can be significantly simplified due to the fact that intermediate results of form {a mathematical formula}a: ∃ r.A no longer need to be computed and maintained.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If we use SI to denote{a mathematical formula}SIfa(O), and SC to denote{a mathematical formula}SCfa(O), then the following invariants hold in each step of computation of SI, where{a mathematical formula}a,b ∈ INOare two individuals,{a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ CNTare two concepts, and{a mathematical formula}r ∈ RNOis a role:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We have identified other similar axioms in both TBox and ABox of Travel that are not nominal-safe, which partially explains the missing of some results and also motivates us to investigate approximation based on a complete {a mathematical formula}EL++ rule set in the future.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For example, if the original ontology contains an axiom {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D, then due to the involvement of rule R10, the closure of our approach will include {a mathematical formula}fa(~D) ⊑ fa(~C), which corresponds to {a mathematical formula}¬D ⊑ ¬C in the original ontology.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, such a new rule will generate consequences of form {a mathematical formula}A1 ⊓ … An ⊑ X, where {a mathematical formula}Ai are atomic concepts in the approximated TBox and n is bounded by the size of the vocabulary.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Our approach can infer that {a mathematical formula}X ⊑ Y with the extended rule set.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If the ontology contains multiple cardinality restriction axioms of form (96) with different values of N, in worst case, the algorithm still needs to perform {a mathematical formula}2k searches, where k is bounded by the size of the concept vocabulary.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In fact, a more generalised variation of the above rule is used in consequence-based algorithms for Horn-{a mathematical formula}SHIQ[41] and {a mathematical formula}ALCH[73] to deal with similar forms of interactions between existential restrictions and inverse roles (note that an {a mathematical formula}ALCH axiom of form {a mathematical formula}X ⊑ ∀ r.B is equivalent to the axiom (100) in our example).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Nevertheless, the computational price is that such a rule will generate consequences of form {a mathematical formula}X ⊑ ∃ r.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Note that an axiom of form {a mathematical formula} ∃ R. ⊤ ⊑ B is essentially a range restriction of {a mathematical formula}inv(R) and can always be eliminated without affecting the semantics of the TBox [1].</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">However, with such an extension, our approach will now be able to infer that {a mathematical formula}X ⊑ D.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Similar as Theorem 2, this theorem can be proved by showing that {a mathematical formula}O ∪ O ′ ∪ Tfa conservatively extends both {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}O ′ on {a mathematical formula} Σ O, where {a mathematical formula}Tfa is the set of definition {a mathematical formula}fa(P) ≡ P for all term P of {a mathematical formula}O except complement of roles.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">If it is derived by R6, then there is {a mathematical formula}{b} ⊑ {a} ∈ SI.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">As we explained earlier in the proof, if {a mathematical formula}{b} ⊑ {a} is an initial element of SI without any inference, then we have {a mathematical formula}b ≐ a ∈ SNF.</a>
