<a href="#0" id="0">The function {a mathematical formula}N ∃ and {a mathematical formula}N ∀ can be easily computed from the transition relation T, i.e., let {a mathematical formula}ai ∈ Ni(s) for {a mathematical formula}i ∈ { ∃ , ∀ } and {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S if there exist an adversary action {a mathematical formula}aj ∈ Actj, with {a mathematical formula}j ∈ { ∃ , ∀ } and {a mathematical formula}j ≠ i, and a state {a mathematical formula}t ∈ S such that {a mathematical formula}(s,a,t) ∈ T, where {a mathematical formula}a=(ai,aj) if {a mathematical formula}i= ∃ and {a mathematical formula}a=(aj,ai) if {a mathematical formula}i= ∀ .We proceed to introduce the formula expressing the existence of a strategy of agent ∃ to win the game.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The components of the algorithm will implicitly use {a mathematical formula}sk,ok for {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ k ≤ d and {a mathematical formula}ak for {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ k ≤ d as parameters, which represent state and agents A's observation of time k, and agents A's action to reach states at time k, respectively.</a>
