<a href="#0" id="0">Roughly speaking, in our approach, we consider a set of individuals S in a network to be a most influential set, with respect to a particular goal of interest, if S is the most preferred subset among all those that satisfy the following condition: were the individuals in S to choose the behavior {a mathematical formula}xS prescribed to them by a desired stable outcome {a mathematical formula}x ≡ (xS,x − S) which achieves the goal of interest, then the only stable outcome of the system that remains consistent with their choices {a mathematical formula}xS is x itself.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Said more intuitively, once the nodes in the most influential set S follow the behavior {a mathematical formula}xS prescribed to them by a desired stable outcome x achieving the goal of interest, they become collectively “ so influential ” that their behavior “ forces ” every other individual to a unique choice of behavior!</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Despite these fundamental differences in objectives, settings, models, problem formulations, and solution concepts, one cannot escape the high level of interest in diffusion models within the computer science community.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, in the remaining of this subsection, we still attempt to briefly mention some possible points of contrast between the typical approach to identifying the most influential nodes in the diffusion setting, as described by Kleinberg [49], and ours.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the solution S to I, every clause has a literal that is true.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, in J every clause k has some variable {a mathematical formula}i ∈ Vk such that {a mathematical formula}xi=lk,i.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We have to show that the total influence on k is at least the threshold of k:{a mathematical formula} Since for some {a mathematical formula}i ∈ Vk, {a mathematical formula}xi=lk,i, the above inequality holds strictly, that is,{a mathematical formula} Therefore, every clause k must play 1.We need to show that no variable player has incentive to deviate, given that the other players do not change their actions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The total influence on any variable player i is {a mathematical formula} ∑ k ∈ Cizk(1 − 2lk,i)= ∑ k ∈ Ci(1 − 2lk,i) (since {a mathematical formula}zr=1 for every clause r).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The threshold of i is {a mathematical formula} ∑ k ∈ Ci(1 − 2lk,i).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, every variable player i is indifferent between choosing actions 1 and 0 and has no incentive to deviate.We now consider the reverse direction, that is, given a PSNE in J we show that there exists a satisfying assignment in I.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Now, add two new players, named the all-satisfied-verification player and the none-satisfied-verification player, which have threshold values of {a mathematical formula}m − Ε and − Ε , respectively.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We add arcs from every clause player to these two new players, and the arcs to the all-satisfied-verification player are weighted by 1, and the ones to the none-satisfied-verification player are weighted by − 1.In addition, add {a mathematical formula}k=m2 new players, named extra players, and let these players constitute the set of designated players.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Also, the PSNE of a potential game are essentially the local minima (or stationary points) of the potential function.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence, one could view the players as trying to optimize the potential function as a “ global group ” but via “ individual, local best-responses. ” By performing asynchronous/non-simultaneous best-response dynamics, the players are implicitly performing an axis-parallel optimization of the potential function.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Because the domain of the potential function (i.e., the space of joint-actions) is finite, this process will always converge to a local maxima or stable point of the potential function, or equivalently, to a PSNE of the potential game.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Hence, every potential game always has a PSNE.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The reason the result in Proposition 3.8 generalizes beyond PSNE is that, as is well-known, two games with the same number of players and the same set of actions for each player have the same CE set if the set of payoff functions {a mathematical formula}{ui1} and {a mathematical formula}{ui2} of the games 1 and 2, respectively, satisfy the following condition: for all players i, there exist a positive constant {a mathematical formula}ci>0 and an arbitrary real-valued function {a mathematical formula}di of the actions of all the players except i, such that, {a mathematical formula}ui1(x1,x − i)=ciui2(xi,x − i)+di(x − i).</a>
