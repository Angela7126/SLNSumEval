<a href="#0" id="0">The same holds for the case of {a mathematical formula}Dodgsonk-SP societies, by the work of Erdélyi et al.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}Dodgsonk-SP society with respect to L, and</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}PerceptionFlipk-SP society with respect to L.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}f(0,0)=0.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For the case of {a mathematical formula}PerceptionFlipk-SP societies it suffices to give a polynomial-time algorithm that does the following.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given a vote v and a societal axis L, both over the same set of candidates, the algorithm finds the smallest number of (sequential) swaps of adjacent candidates so as to transform L into {a mathematical formula}L ′ such that v is single-peaked with respect to {a mathematical formula}L ′ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(The {a mathematical formula}k=0 case of this result follows from Faliszewski et al.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Below we focus on the former case.The {a mathematical formula}m ⩾ 5 case follows using the same proof as the {a mathematical formula}m ⩾ 5 case of Theorem 5.6.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The {a mathematical formula}m=4 case follows using the same proof as the {a mathematical formula}m=4 case of Theorem 5.6 except that, in order for the votes to be within one adjacent swap of being consistent with societal order, the two voters in S now vote {a mathematical formula}c>b>a>p and {a mathematical formula}a>p>c>b.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The {a mathematical formula}m=3 case follows from Observation 5.2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We note that in election {a mathematical formula}(C,V) the scores of candidates are as follows:</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">each candidate in {a mathematical formula}G ′ has 1 point.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We also have an additional “ garbage ” candidate {a mathematical formula}gpt.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Thus {a mathematical formula}A ″ must contain exactly k candidates from A.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">{a mathematical formula}r ″ ⩽ r ′ ,</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula}r ′ ⩽ K,</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">{a mathematical formula}score(C,V)(c1)=score({c1,c2},V)(c1),</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We start with {a mathematical formula}v ′ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Now consider the process of converting {a mathematical formula}v ′ to {a mathematical formula}v ″ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">There is a single vote that is single-peaked with respect to L and ranks p first (followed by the candidates in {a mathematical formula}Gp).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">There is a single vote that is single-peaked with respect to L and ranks d first (followed by the candidates in {a mathematical formula}Gd) and ranks p last.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Set {a mathematical formula}Kp= ‖ D ′ ∩ A ‖ .</a>
