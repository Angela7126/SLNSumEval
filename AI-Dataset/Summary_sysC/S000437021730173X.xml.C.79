<a href="#0" id="0">Given a planning task {a mathematical formula} Π =(V,A,c,I,G), its state space, denoted {a mathematical formula} Θ Π , is the labeled transition system {a mathematical formula} Θ Π =(S,L,c,T,I,SG) whose states S are all states of Π ; whose labels L are the actions A; whose cost function c is that of Π ; whose transitions {a mathematical formula}p → aq are those were a is applicable in p and {a mathematical formula}q=p 〚 a 〛 ; whose initial state I is that of Π ; and whose goal states {a mathematical formula}SG are those p where {a mathematical formula}p[V(G)]=G.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Furthermore, given a solution {a mathematical formula} Π F for {a mathematical formula} Θ Π F, the corresponding plan Π for Π as per Theorem 3 can be constructed by selecting, for every leaf factor, a cheapest leaf goal state {a mathematical formula}sL, and a cheapest path to {a mathematical formula}sL in the respective compliant-path graph.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Specifically, here and in the discussions below, by an exponential separation from X, where X is an alternate search reduction method, we mean a family {a mathematical formula}{ Π n|n ∈ N+} of planning tasks, of size (number of state variables and actions) polynomially related to n, so that (i) the number of reachable decoupled states is bounded by a polynomial in n, while (ii) the state space size under X is exponential in n. In most cases, the exponential separation will be our Scaling example, fixing, for simplicity, the number of locations to be the same as the number n of objects {a mathematical formula}oi to transport.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">State space search here is guided by a heuristic function, heuristic for short, a function h that maps states s to estimates of remaining cost, i.e., of the cost of an optimal solution for s. We denote that latter cost as the perfect heuristic{a mathematical formula}h ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Per the definition of augmented optimality (Definition 5, page 35), the augmented-perfect heuristic {a mathematical formula}hF ⁎ accounts, not only for standard path cost from a decoupled state s, but also for the cost of compliant leaf goal paths that a solution for s needs to be augmented with.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In particular, the subset of artificial actions {a mathematical formula}a[sL] present, as well as their cost, depend on the decoupled state s. This is problematic for heuristic functions relying crucially on precomputations prior to search, like the aforementioned abstraction heuristics.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Disregarding solution quality, one can run any search algorithm on the decoupled state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Π F, treating it like an arbitrary transition system.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the first part of the claim, t and {a mathematical formula}q ˆ as specified must exist simply because the individual transitions on an embedded path from {a mathematical formula}p ˆ to {a mathematical formula}q ˆ all follow decoupled transitions ({a mathematical formula}FC) respectively compliant-path graph arcs ({a mathematical formula}FL) present in {a mathematical formula} Θ Π F.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For the second part of the claim, if {a mathematical formula} Π F is a decoupled path from s to t, then we can backchain from {a mathematical formula}q ˆ through the compliant-path graphs along {a mathematical formula} Π F to obtain the desired embedded state {a mathematical formula}p ˆ in s. □</a>
