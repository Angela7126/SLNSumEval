<a href="#0" id="0">In addition, the diagnosis probability function p is often a (usually rough) approximation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, the actual question is how accurate is a health state generated from a given Ω and p. A complementing question is which and how many diagnoses should a DA return in order to generate a high quality health state.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, if two components have almost the same probability of being faulty according to the health state, but one is cheaper to repair than the other, then an intelligent system may choose to repair that component first, even if its probability is slightly smaller than the other component.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, the wasted effort metric is mostly given here for completeness and compatibility with previous work.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The main question we ask in this analysis is how many diagnoses are needed to produce a high quality health state.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As a preliminary, we observed that after a certain number of diagnoses the quality of the health state converges to some stable value, after which adding more diagnoses results in negligible or non-existent change in health state quality.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In our experiment we set {a mathematical formula}N=440 which is approximately the average number of overall diagnoses found per system and M was not set to a fixed number but rather to the cardinality of the initial candidate diagnosis (the number of faulty components in the initial consistent candidate diagnosis).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our results provide some support for this rational: in more than 70% of the observations in all the examined Boolean circuits systems, the health state has converged to a Ε -stable value (using the AUC metric) without requiring any diagnosis that is not of minimal cardinality.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Using the Euclidean distance metric, almost all the observations (more than 90%) needed only to compute minimal cardinality diagnoses to obtain a Ε -stable health state.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, in most cases, limiting the DA to find only minimal cardinality diagnoses seems to be a reasonable choice.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Moreover, a high-quality health state can be found with only a subset of all minimal cardinality diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Table 13, Table 14 show the ratio of minimal cardinality diagnoses (where 1 corresponds to all minimal cardinality diagnoses) required on average, to reach a Ε -stable health state using AUC and Euclidean metrics respectively.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As can be seen, even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1, only a fraction of the minimal cardinality diagnoses are needed to reach a Ε -stable health state.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For example, only 17% of the minimal cardinality diagnoses are needed to generate a health state that is Ε -stable for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 for the 74181 system under the Euclidean distance metric (Table 14).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Although the proposed online stopping condition is very simple, the results in Table 15, Table 16 show that the resulting values for {a mathematical formula} Δ =0.1 are almost exactly the same as those obtained for health states generated from all diagnoses ({a mathematical formula} Δ =0).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Our approach uses the residual difference to calculate the added value of finding more diagnoses, and presents as an output the health state – the likelihood of each component to be faulty.</a>
