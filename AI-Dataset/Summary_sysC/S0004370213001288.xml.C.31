<a href="#1" id="1">In the CCAC problem for R we are given two disjoint sets of candidates, C and A, a collection V of votes over {a mathematical formula}C ∪ A, a candidate {a mathematical formula}p ∈ C, and a nonnegative integer K. We ask whether there is a set {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊆ A such that (a) {a mathematical formula} ‖ A ′ ‖ ⩽ K, and (b) p is a winner of R election {a mathematical formula}(C ∪ A ′ ,V).</a>

<a href="#11" id="11">Proof</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The following holds for swoon-SP elections.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For each t, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that given an instance of CCDV for t-approval elections finds a number s such that the minimal number of voters that we have to delete from our input election in order to ensure the preferred candidate ʼ s victory is between{a mathematical formula}12sand s.Let {a mathematical formula}E=(C,V) be our input election and let L be our given societal axis with respect to which E is a swoon-SP election.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let p be our preferred candidate.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Our algorithm proceeds as follows:</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">2.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">There is a single vote that is single-peaked with respect to L and ranks p first (followed by the candidates in {a mathematical formula}Gp).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The crucial observation here is that the proof of the CCDC case of Theorem 6.4 ensures that deleting candidates outside of the set A is never a successful strategy.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Adding the voters {a mathematical formula}Vq ′ does not affect this observation because in all votes in {a mathematical formula}Vq ′ candidate p is either ranked first or ranked last.</a>
