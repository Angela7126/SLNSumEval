<a href="#0" id="0">It is important to note that if ∇ is an ES basic fusion operator, restricted to the triple {a mathematical formula}W ⁎ , {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ , N, we can establish analogous results to those presented in Section 4 and Appendix A, adapting their statements to the case where a selected finite society N is chosen, the profiles are restricted N-profiles {a mathematical formula} Φ ⁎ over {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ , integrity constrains E, {a mathematical formula}E ′ are epistemic states in {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ and the interpretations w, {a mathematical formula}w ′ and {a mathematical formula}w ″ are elements in {a mathematical formula}W ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to prove Property 3, consider N in {a mathematical formula}F ⁎ (S), {a mathematical formula}{N1,N2} a partition of N, Φ an N-profile and w, {a mathematical formula}w ′ interpretations such that {a mathematical formula}w ⪰ Φ ↾ N1w ′ and {a mathematical formula}w ⪰ Φ ↾ N2w ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We want to show that {a mathematical formula}w ⪰ Φ w ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let E be an epistemic state such that {a mathematical formula} 〚 B(E) 〛 ={w,w ′ }.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By (B-Rep), {a mathematical formula}w ⊨ B( ∇ ( Φ ↾ N1,E)) ∧ B( ∇ ( Φ ↾ N2,E)).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, by (ESF7), we have {a mathematical formula}w ⊨ B( ∇ ( Φ ,E)).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, by (B-Rep), {a mathematical formula}w ⪰ Φ w ′ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">(If part) Suppose that the assignment {a mathematical formula} Φ ↦ ⪰ Φ satisfies Property 3.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In order to prove that ∇ satisfies (ESF7), consider N in {a mathematical formula}F ⁎ (S), {a mathematical formula}{N1,N2} a partition of N, Φ an N-profile and E an epistemic state.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If {a mathematical formula}B( ∇ ( Φ ↾ N1,E)) is inconsistent with {a mathematical formula}B( ∇ ( Φ ↾ N2,E)) the result follows straightforwardly.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let N be a finite society of agents in {a mathematical formula}S. Define the following set:{a mathematical formula} Since we have (ESF-P), by Observation 3, N is decisive.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Thus, {a mathematical formula}X is nonempty.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let D be an element of {a mathematical formula}X having minimal cardinality.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Since D is decisive then {a mathematical formula}D ≠ ∅ , as we noted in Observation 3.</a>
