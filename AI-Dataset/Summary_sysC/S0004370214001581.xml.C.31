<a href="#0" id="0">A red – black finite-domain representation ({a mathematical formula}RB) planning task is given by a quintuple {a mathematical formula} Π = 〈 VB,VR,A,I,G 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}VB and {a mathematical formula}VR are sets of finite-domain state variables, called black variables and red variables, respectively, and A, I, and G are exactly as in {a mathematical formula}FDR and {a mathematical formula}MFDR tasks, specified with respect to the union of the black and red variables.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Adopting the notion of reversibility in red – black planning requires a slight, natural adaptation: Since the value sets of the red variables in states reachable from I will always include their initial values anyway, reversibility should be requested only on the task's black variables.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is, we say that an {a mathematical formula}RB task {a mathematical formula} Π = 〈 VB,VR,A,I,G 〉 is reversible if, for every state s reachable from I, there exists an action sequence Π so that {a mathematical formula}s 〚 Π 〛 [VB]=I[VB].</a>

<a href="#10" id="10">The main choice points are (i) selecting actions {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A0 in the while loop (pertains to red facts following), and (ii) selecting DTG paths for black variables in the solution to {a mathematical formula} Π B, i.e., inside {a mathematical formula}Achieve(g) (pertains to both, red facts following and relaxed plan repair).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We would like to make both choices in a way such that the returned red – black plan Π is (a) short, and (b) executable as much as possible in the original {a mathematical formula}FDR planning task we are trying to solve.</a>
