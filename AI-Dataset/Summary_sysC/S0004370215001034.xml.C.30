<a href="#0" id="0">Table 1 shows for a number of place types b which pair of place types {a mathematical formula}(a,c) minimizes {a mathematical formula}BtwA(a,b,c).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While such triples do not always correspond to our intuition of betweenness, they tend to be useful for implementing interpolative reasoning, as we will see in Section 6.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also found some triples {a mathematical formula}(a,b,c) in which one of the place types is a generalization of the other(s).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Examples include:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} To more accurately model the relationship between place types at different levels of granularity, we could represent place types as regions, instead of points, and identify approximate betweenness, overlap, and part-of relations between these regions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Such representations can be obtained by clustering the text documents associated with each entity, representing each such cluster as a point in {a mathematical formula}S and then identifying the entity e.g.</a>
