<a href="#0" id="0">Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that general appliance models can be constructed using data from only a small number of appliances (typically 3 – 6 appliances), and furthermore that 28 – 99% of the remaining behaviour which is specific to a single household can be learned using only aggregate data from existing smart meters.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, this method has only been demonstrated for households containing up to 5 appliance types, and the large state space introduced by 15 – 20 appliance types is likely to cause the inference process to be unable to distinguish between appliances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, none of these methods scale automatically to realistic previously unseen homes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We denote the posterior parameters as {a mathematical formula}C ˜ i.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the case of the refrigerator, there is a sufficient amount of training data available in existing appliance data sets, and so a uniform prior is also a sufficient distribution.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We use the model likelihood as a metric for evaluating how well an appliance model explains the test data, averaged over each fold of the data set.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This metric represents the likelihood of the test data, x, given a general appliance model, Θ , with both the appliance states z and parameters Θ integrated out, as given by:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}p(x,z| Θ ) is calculated using Eq.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A clear trend common to all appliance types is that the model log-odds increases towards an asymptote as the number of appliance instances in the training set increases.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This indicates that the majority of the appliance type's behaviour can be described by a general model learned from a relatively small number of appliance instances.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As such, we argue that it is not necessary to build an exhaustive database of all appliance instances as other work has discussed [25], [24], and instead we propose the use of a database of distributions over possible appliance behaviour.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This trend is most obvious when comparing the kettle to the washing machine, since the kettle almost converges with a training set of only 3 instances due to its single heating component, while the washing machine does not converge until the training set contains 6 appliance instances as a result of its multiple motors and heating elements.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This indicates that fewer training examples are required for appliances with fewer electrical components before the optimal general model is achieved.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">a microwave often used on low power).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Therefore, in this section we propose a method for learning such behaviour that is unique to a single household, which uses both general appliance models and household aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">More formally, this tuning process directly corresponds to learning the parameters {a mathematical formula} Θ (n) for an appliance instance n in a household, given the appliance type's general model Θ and the household's aggregate data x.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Last, we provide an evaluation using the REDD data set which demonstrates the benefit of model tuning from aggregate data (Section 3.3).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As discussed above, our proposed approach requires periods during which a single given appliance is operating to be extracted from an aggregate load.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">However, it is important to note that our approach aims to extract periods during which only the appliance of interest is changing state, and that other appliances might be drawing a constant power during this period.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">This threshold is set such that the model will accept windows of data which can be explained by a set of appliance parameters drawn from the given appliance type's general model, and reject any windows of data generated by other appliance types or combinations of appliances.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Therefore, this process effectively identifies windows of aggregate data during which only an appliance matching its general model changes state.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">It is worth noting that the data likelihood {a mathematical formula}p(x¯i:j| Θ ) is inherently dependent upon the variance within an appliance type, since it decreases as the variance of the general appliance model increases.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Therefore, we use the sub-metered data from Section 2 to calculate D for each appliance type as the minimum of {a mathematical formula}p(x(n)| Θ ) for each appliance instance n, and as a result this threshold generalises to unseen households.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Given that both the general model for this appliance type, Θ , and signatures sampled from the specific appliance instance are available, {a mathematical formula}x¯i:j, Bayesian integration [15] provides a natural approach to infer the posterior distribution over such appliance instance parameters with the state sequence marginalised out:{a mathematical formula} Therefore, we update the general model again using variational message passing as described in Appendix A.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">These four approaches are summarised in Table 4.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">As in the previous section, we evaluate the extent to which an appliance model explains the appliance's power demand using the logit function applied to the model likelihood, given by Eqs.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">For the AT method, the vast majority of the time was required to search for windows of aggregate data which could be explained by the general appliance models with a relatively high likelihood, while only a small amount of time was required to update the general models using the extracted signatures.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Having introduced a method by which general appliance models could be tuned to the specific appliances in a household given only aggregate data, and evaluated its performance using the REDD data set, we showed that the tuning process provides an improvement over using general appliance models and the current state-of-the-art tuning method.</a>
