<a href="#0" id="0">Nevertheless, supervising and operating multiple robots simultaneously is a difficult task for a single operator to execute.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this article we propose a novel approach for utilizing automated advising agents in assisting an operator to better manage a team of multiple robots in complex environments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We introduce an advice provision methodology and exemplify its implementation using automated advising agents in two real-world human – multi-robot team collaboration tasks: the Search And Rescue (SAR) and the warehouse operation tasks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our intelligent advising agents were evaluated through extensive field trials, with over 150 human operators using both simulated and physical mobile robots, and showed a significant improvement in the team's performance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The agent provides advice for the operator regarding which actions s/he should take and acts as a smart filter between the robots' requests and the human operator.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Advice: A piece of advice is defined as a possible action {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A suggested by an automated agent for the human operator to perform.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this study, we assume that the agent can only provide one piece of advice at a time.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The operator is not obligated to accept the agent's advice, namely, she does not have to perform the suggested actions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the warehouse operation task, using a subject group of Computer Science students, the results show that the 2-MYAO heuristic, deployed by the W-AID2 agent, significantly outperforms the 1-MYAO heuristic deployed by the W-AID1 agent, which in turn significantly enhanced human operator's performance compared to the baseline condition of no advising agent.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Using an additional group of students, this time we evaluate the 3-MYAO heuristic, deployed by the W-AID3 agent, which significantly outperforms the 2-MYAO heuristic deployed by the W-AID2 agent.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the SAR task, the results show that the 2-MYAO heuristic deployed by the S-AID significantly enhanced human operator's performance compared to the baseline condition of no advising agent.</a>
