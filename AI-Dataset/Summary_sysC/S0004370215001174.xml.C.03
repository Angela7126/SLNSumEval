<a href="#0" id="0">Our results show not only the steadily increasing complexity of the tasks that RoboCup@Home robots can solve but also the increased performance for all of the functionalities addressed in the competition.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, we focus on how this analysis has been carried out in the last years within the RoboCup@Home competition, which is the largest competition for domestic and service robots.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The evaluation of a competition's effectiveness based on the scores of the teams over the years is important for better fueling the competition and the novel approach introduced in RoboCup@Home for addressing this issue is the main contribution of this article.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast to software competitions, robotic competitions are run in a real physical environment with real robots and require a physical space in which the competition takes place.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After the first two years of RoboCup@Home competitions (2006 â€“ 2007), we discussed how to evaluate the performances in terms of measuring the improvements demonstrated by the teams in the tests over the years.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, to analyze the results of teams during the competition in more detail and to compare results over the years, we need a method to measure the performances of the teams in the tests with respect to the desired functionalities.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An important feature of a robotic competition is the setup of an environment in which it is possible to test integrated robotic systems in actual operational conditions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore the competition set up and the tests performed by the robots are important data sources for benchmarking.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The scoring system described above allows for analysis of the results of the teams in the different functionalities and can also be used to evaluate the progress of the entire competition, as explained in this section.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As shown in the analysis reported in the previous section and in the description of the proposed solutions below, the changes in the competition rules enabled teams to address specific solutions to the problems in different years.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the last few years, the object manipulation tasks in the tests actually require some form of object recognition and object positioning (e.g., there may be many objects on a table at random positions and the robot has to grab the correct one).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However, points are given only if the robot explains the situation well in particular tests (e.g., it declares that a specific object has been found or a command has been understood), and the rules clearly state that teams are responsible for a sound system that allows referees to understand the robot's speech.</a>
