<a href="#0" id="0">In this subsection, we present another transferring phase that exploits Web search to bridge source and target domains.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Based on the weights attained by Step 4a of Algorithm 1, in this phase we transfer knowledge from source domains by further updating the weights w of formulas {a mathematical formula}F0.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The procedure is shown in Algorithm 5.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For each action model set {a mathematical formula}Ai from source domain {a mathematical formula}Di, we encode {a mathematical formula}Ai with a set of formulas {a mathematical formula}Fi as is done by Step 3 of Algorithm 2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After that, we calculate the similarity between formulas in {a mathematical formula}F0 and {a mathematical formula}Fi, and accumulate the weights w of {a mathematical formula}F0, as is described by Steps 4 – 9 of Algorithm 5.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that in Step 5 of Algorithm 5, the procedure “ can_map ” returns true if the number of parameters of each literal in formulas s and t is the same; otherwise, it returns false.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the following, we will focus on Step 6 of Algorithm 5, about how to build the similarity function from across domains using Web search.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This similarity function is used to transfer knowledge from source domains to the target domain.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We first compare the TRAMP algorithm to another transfer learning approach LAWS[73] which is based on Web search, to see the advantage of exploiting transfer based on both plan traces and Web search, as is done by TRAMP.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Since LAWS aims at transferring from one source domain, we set the number of source domains in TRAMP to be one as well to make the comparison fair.</a>
