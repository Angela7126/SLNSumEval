<a href="#0" id="0">Section 4 develops query complexity results for certain forms of monotone predicates; it is shown that minimal sets for these predicates can be computed with a logarithmic number of calls to an NP oracle that provides a witness (the class {a mathematical formula}FPNP[wit,log]).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">With an NP oracle, the identification of the actual set of satisfied clauses requires more than a logarithmic number of calls to an NP oracle; otherwise {a mathematical formula}P=NP[16, Theorem 5.4].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The first result shows that minimal sets for predicates of form {a mathematical formula}L can be solved by a logarithmic number of calls to an NP witness-oracle.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ R denote some minimal set of P. Then, by definition of predicate of form {a mathematical formula}L (Definition 7), there exists an assignment that satisfies {a mathematical formula}G ∧ ⋀ u ∈ R ∖ M Σ (u).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">So it remains to investigate the predicates of form {a mathematical formula}P. For this form we are able to show logarithmic complexity only when the number of minimal sets is bounded.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Lemma 4 together with the fact that {a mathematical formula}MaxSet ∈ FPNP[wit,log] enables constructing a minimal set for predicates of form {a mathematical formula}P whenever the minimal set is unique.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This section extends the results of Section 4 to the case when it is known that there are exactly k minimal sets, for some constant k. Given the results of previous sections, form {a mathematical formula}P is the only predicate form of interest, since function problems represented with predicates of either form {a mathematical formula}L or {a mathematical formula}B can be solved with a logarithmic number of witness oracle calls (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In Theorem 6 we used the technique that as long as we know that there is a unique minimal set it suffices to remove each element of {a mathematical formula}R and test whether the predicate still holds.</a>
