<a href="#0" id="0">4b and 4c, which could define a factored BMDP (Section 3), when the joint transition probabilities are calculated, we no longer have an interval-based model and thus the Interval Value Iteration algorithm [29] for BMDPs cannot be applied.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since in practice, problems are commonly described in a factored way, it must be assumed that any SSP MDP-IP generated from a factored description will have to deal with nonlinear optimization problems, even though the set of constraints for the probability parameters are simple intervals.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to sample the next state, three different methods are considered for choosing a value for each probability parameter {a mathematical formula}pi, subject to a set of constraints Φ : (1) the use of the same parameter values computed in the Bellman update called minimax_parameter_choice; (2) computing a random legal parameter value at each step during the trial called rand_parameter_choice; (3) computing a predefined legal parameter value only once called predefined_parameter_choice.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Convergence of RTDP-IP with different methods for sampling the next stateIn an SSP MDP-IP, repeated RTDP-IP trials eventually yield optimal values over all relevant states if: (i) the initial value function is admissible, i.e.,{a mathematical formula}V0(s) ≤ V ⁎ (s), ∀ s ∈ Sand (ii) the method of choosing a probability distribution{a mathematical formula}P( ⋅ |s,a) ∈ K( ⋅ |s,a)to sample the next state guarantees choosing{a mathematical formula}P( ⋅ |s,a) ∈ K( ⋅ |s,a)such that{a mathematical formula}P(s ′ |s,a) ≠ 0for any{a mathematical formula}s ′ ∈ S.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It should be noted that, after computing Equation (26), {a mathematical formula}Qt+1(x → ,a) and {a mathematical formula}Vt+1(x → ) end up having real values, different from the resulting ADD computed by SPUDD-IP backup (Equations (20) and (21)), where {a mathematical formula}QDDt+1(X → ,a) and {a mathematical formula}VDDt+1(X → ) are ADDs that represent the corresponding values for the complete set of states.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Notice that the size of CredalSetVerticesHash will be the number of credal sets for the predefined_parameter_choice method and less or equal to this number for the rand_parameter_choice method, given the fact that not all the states will be visited.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, in the worst case scenario the size is equal to {a mathematical formula}n ⁎ 2maxa,Xi ⁡ |paa(Xi)| ⁎ |A| (Equation (16)).</a>
