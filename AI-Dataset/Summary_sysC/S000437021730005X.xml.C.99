<a href="#0" id="0">Here we define a plan case by a triple, i.e., an initial state {a mathematical formula}s0, a goal g and an action sequence that transits {a mathematical formula}s0 to g. These cases can be seen as providing additional knowledge of the domain over and above the incomplete domain theory.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An action model {a mathematical formula} 〈 a,PRE(a),ADD(a),DEL(a) 〉 is considered incomplete if in {a mathematical formula}PRE(a), {a mathematical formula}ADD(a), or {a mathematical formula}DEL(a) there are predicates missing which lead to some of the set of predefined planning solutions to fail.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">After that, we build a set of plan fragments based on plan cases and causal pairs, and then mine a set of frequent plan fragments with a specific threshold.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These frequent fragments will be integrated together to form the final solution {a mathematical formula}psol based on causal pairs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It begins with the step of collecting sets of predicates P, action schemas A and macro-operator schemas O from incomplete action models {a mathematical formula}A ˜ and plan cases {a mathematical formula}C. In the next two steps, it constructs sets of soft and hard constraints to ensure that the learned domain model can best explain the input plan cases and incomplete action models.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Its actions have strong connections with each other with respect to incomplete action models, which suggests these actions are more likely to be successfully executed (i.e., with respect to the complete domain model).</a>
