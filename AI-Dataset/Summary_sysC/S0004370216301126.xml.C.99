<a href="#0" id="0">By Theorem 1, any sequence of IR deals must converge to an efficient state, independently from the specific payment scheme in use.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we are using the Knaster payment scheme, any state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) reached during negotiation will satisfy {a mathematical formula} Π (i)=exi(A) − Ex(A)/n for each agent i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, we are bound to converge to a state {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ) with an efficient allocation {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ where {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (i)=exi(A ⁎ ) − Ex(A ⁎ )/n.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For convergence to an efficient allocation by means of IR deals, {a mathematical formula}nm − 1, with n being the number of agents and m being the number of goods, is known to be a (tight) upper bound on the longest path, i.e., there exist profiles of valuation functions and initial allocations such that it is possible to visit all allocations before convergence [29].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Inspection of the proof of that result shows that it does not depend on the payment scheme used.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence, {a mathematical formula}nm − 1 is also an upper bound on the number of deals for scenarios covered by Theorem 4 — at least if we do not put restrictions on the nature of our agents' valuation functions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Take a scenario where the agents have the valuation functions used in the proof of Lemma 6, except that {a mathematical formula}vn(G) is set to such a high value that the only way of achieving a proportional state is to give all goods to agent n (because no payments the other agents would be prepared to make could be large enough to give utility {a mathematical formula}vn(G)/n to agent n).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We first show that the following invariant will be true for every state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) and every agent i, provided that agents only negotiate IR deals using the GUPF:{a mathematical formula} Our proof proceeds by induction over the number of deals negotiated.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As we assume that initial equitability payments have been made, claim (2) will certainly be true for the initial state {a mathematical formula}(A0, Π 0).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Now let {a mathematical formula} Δ =(A,A ′ ) and assume (2) holds for A and the associated payment balance Π .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We obtain the payment balance {a mathematical formula} Π ′ associated with {a mathematical formula}A ′ by adding the appropriate GUPF payments to Π :{a mathematical formula} This proves our claim (2).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Note that the initial state is not envy-free, not even after the initial equitability payments, as for instance agent 2 envies agent 1, given that {a mathematical formula}u2(A0(1), Π 0(1))=4+8/3=20/3>8/3=8 − 16/3=u2(A0(2), Π 0(2)).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As argued in Section 3.4, Lemma 6 shows that the bounds on the lengths of paths to convergence established in previous work on negotiating efficient allocation for arbitrary valuation functions [29] apply also to the types of scenarios covered by Theorem 8: 1 is a (tight) upper bound on the shortest path and {a mathematical formula}nm − 1 is a (tight) upper bound on the longest path.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Theorem 8 is a surprising result.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">As pointed out elsewhere [13], it is not possible to define a “ local ” criterion for the acceptability of deals (which can be checked taking only the valuation functions of the agents involved into account) that would guarantee that a sequence of such deals always converges to an envy-free state.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">First, observe that under the payment scheme of Theorem 8, which is characterised by Inequality (2), the envy-freeness condition {a mathematical formula}ui(A(i), Π (i)) ⩾ ui(A(j), Π (j)) is equivalent to the following inequality (which must hold for any two agents i and j):{a mathematical formula} To prove the claim of the theorem, we give an example with two agents and two goods, where Inequality (3) fails to be satisfied for the unique efficient allocation.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Hence, as negotiation by means of IR deals is bound to lead to that efficient allocation, and as the payment scheme is fixed, this will show that the final allocation cannot be envy-free.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Of course, any number of payment functions could achieve these final payment balances, as long as we can be sure that the rule applied during the very last deal is such that we get the correct values for {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In particular, knowing only the differences in individual valuations between two allocations A and {a mathematical formula}A ′ is not sufficient information to determine whether {a mathematical formula}A ′ is efficient, i.e., whether the process will terminate once {a mathematical formula}A ′ is reached.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The two intervals do not overlap.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">So it is a relevant question whether a given negotiation state admits a deal that would not only be IR but that also reduces envy in the system (or, as a special case, that completely eliminates envy).</a>
