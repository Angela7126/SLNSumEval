<a href="#0" id="0">No plan solving P can change the value of a variable in the subset{a mathematical formula}{a,b,x}before action{a mathematical formula}u11or after action{a mathematical formula}u21.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the proof of Lemma 2 we already showed that the variables in {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} have to be false before applying action {a mathematical formula}u11, implying that no action can change the value of a variable in {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} before {a mathematical formula}u11.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The action subsequence from Lemma 2 applies action {a mathematical formula}u21 in the partial state {a mathematical formula}{a,b¯,x}, in which no action on {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} is applicable, making it impossible for any plan to change the value of a variable in {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} after {a mathematical formula}u21.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Another direct consequence of Lemma 2 is that the variables in {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} have to be false in the initial state; we can therefore say that a loop instance U has implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}U¯.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Prior to applying action {a mathematical formula}u121, we have to reset the variables in {a mathematical formula}U2 to false to achieve the implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}U¯2 of {a mathematical formula}P2 ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since {a mathematical formula}b1 is false before action {a mathematical formula}u111, conditional loop instance {a mathematical formula}U2 is activated, and to apply the action pair {a mathematical formula}(u101,u111) we have to solve the partial planning instance {a mathematical formula}P2 ′ with implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}U¯2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This corresponds to solving the partial planning problem {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ , which has implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}V¯i+1 ′ since variables in {a mathematical formula}{ai+1,bi+1,xi+1} have to be false for {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ to be solvable due to Lemma 2 and, if {a mathematical formula}i+1<n, we recursively have to satisfy the implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}V¯i+2 ′ of {a mathematical formula}Pi+2 ′ to apply the action pair {a mathematical formula}(u(i+1)01,u(i+1)11) while {a mathematical formula}bi+1 is false.Let {a mathematical formula} Ω i+1 be a plan solving {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We first prove that the variables in S and actions in {a mathematical formula}AS correspond to the algorithm Check that tests whether the formula Φ is satisfied given the current assignment {a mathematical formula}pn+1 to {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">He did not prove a result for a bounded number k of preconditions, but conjectured that plan existence falls into the polynomial hierarchy in a regular way, with the precise complexity determined by k. In this section we modify our previous reduction such that actions have at most two preconditions, thus showing that plan existence is PSPACE-complete for {a mathematical formula}k=2 and proving Bylander's conjecture to be wrong.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Variables {a mathematical formula}r2, … ,rm are used to aggregate the information regarding some clause being unsatisfied, which is necessary since the proof of unsatisfiability for each clause is a separate chain of variables.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">More specifically, {a mathematical formula}rm can be made true if and only if at least one clause is unsatisfied, and can be reset to false only if {a mathematical formula}r2, … ,rm − 1 and their predecessors are false.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We modify the planning problem {a mathematical formula}PF by adding variables {a mathematical formula}c1, … ,ck where {a mathematical formula}k= ⌈ logL(m,n) ⌉ and {a mathematical formula}L(m,n) is the upper bound on the length of optimal plans for {a mathematical formula}PF from Lemma 11 (implying that k is polynomial in the size of F).</a>
