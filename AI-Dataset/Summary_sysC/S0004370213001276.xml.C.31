<a href="#0" id="0">Subjective assessments (SAs), such as “ elegant ” and “ gorgeous, ” are assigned to items by users, and they are common in the reviews and tags found on many online sites.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Analyzing the linked information provided by an SA assigned by a user to an item can improve the recommendation accuracy.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is because this information contains the reason why the user assigned a high or low rating value to the item.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, previous studies have failed to use SAs in an effective manner to improve the recommendation accuracy because few users rate the same items with the same SAs, which leads to the sparsity problem during collaborative filtering.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is the first study to use taxonomies of items and SAs to address the sparsity problem while maintaining the semantic relationships expressed by linked information for tags assigned by users to items.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our method can measure the similarity of users based on items or SAs assigned to items by users, as well as using the item classes, which include the item and the that SCs contain the SAs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This approach overcomes the sparsity problem.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The approach described above measures the similarity of users based on linked taxonomies rather than a single taxonomy of items, which is the case in previous taxonomy-based method [7], [24].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, our method overcomes the sparsity problem, that occurs when applying SAs in CF, by utilizing the SAs/SCs assigned by users to items and their item classes.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Next, we investigated the effects of using subjective classes on the item recommendations.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, we compared Linked Taxonomies with a method that did not use a taxonomy of SAs.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{sup:15} We also investigated the effects of using item classes on the item recommendations.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Thus, we compared Linked Taxonomies with a method that used only a taxonomy of SAs.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{sup:16} The results for the movie dataset are shown in Table 8 while those for the restaurant dataset are shown in Table 9.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We denote the method without a taxonomy of SAs as Without subjective classes and the method with only a taxonomy of SAs as Without item classes.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The results show that Linked Taxonomies had the highest accuracy in all cases for all the numbers of items in the recommendation list examined.</a>
