<a href="#0" id="0">The theorem essentially says that, given a context structure {a mathematical formula}D and a clause system {a mathematical formula}S saturated under the {a mathematical formula}Hyper, {a mathematical formula}Pred, and {a mathematical formula}Succ rules, we can read off the consequences of the form {a mathematical formula}K ⊑ M from the sets {a mathematical formula}S(v) provided that {a mathematical formula}K ⊑ M is a query, the context v is complete (cf.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To estimate the complexity of our algorithm, we note that {a mathematical formula}wd(D2)=4; hence, the number of clauses derived at each context is bounded by {a mathematical formula}4wd(D2)=44, and this bound does not depend on the literal ordering or the number n. In this way, {a mathematical formula}wd(D2) provides us with a better estimate of the or-branching involved in deciding {a mathematical formula}O ⊨ q.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As in Section 4, the definitions of soundness and admissibility for general decompositions do not directly provide us with an algorithm for computing decompositions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a possible remedy, in Section 5.3 we introduce the notion of an Ε -refinement, which is obtained from an Ε -free decomposition by replacing each context v with a tree decomposition of the propositional problem associated with v. In our example, {a mathematical formula}D2 is an Ε -refinement of {a mathematical formula}D1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Throughout Appendix A, we fix a normalized {a mathematical formula}ALCI ontology {a mathematical formula}O, an admissible context structure {a mathematical formula}D= 〈 V,E,core, ≺ 〉 , and a clause system {a mathematical formula}S for {a mathematical formula}D such that no inference rule from Table 3 is applicable to {a mathematical formula}S; furthermore, we fix L to be the set of all literals that occur in {a mathematical formula}O, {a mathematical formula}D, or {a mathematical formula}S. We prove Theorem 6 by showing the following contrapositive claim: {a mathematical formula}O ⊭ K ⊑ M holds for each query {a mathematical formula}K ⊑ M for which a context {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V exists such that</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We proceed similarly as in the proof of Theorem 6 in Appendix A.</a>
