<a href="#1" id="1">In the case of a finite number of random variables with finite ranges, one can uniquely define a joint probability distribution P by assigning a probability number to each joint assignment of values {a mathematical formula}vi ∈ Rangei,i=1, … ,n, to random variables {a mathematical formula}P(V1=v1, … ,Vn=vn).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The definition does not exactly define a probability distribution as it contains imprecise knowledge, but we can define a probability distribution consistent with the definition for those two random variables by the following assignments:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} From this one can compute the probability of for instance {a mathematical formula}P(DM=true):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Only assuming the computable-measure condition for the probability measure one cannot draw that conclusion.An alternative definition of the problem would be:{a mathematical formula} Similarly, the probability of forever_sun might be computable with further assumptions on the probability space, but generally this is not possible, since the finite-dimensional-constraints condition is violated.</a>
