<a href="#0" id="0">In such circumstances, a quality trial solution in a MOO may be deprived of being promoted to the next generation because of its poor (noisy) fitness estimates, while a deceptive solution with illusive good fitness may not be discarded from the current population [2], [3].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This paper addresses the issues of uncertainty management (regarding the selection of qualitative trial solutions) in MOO in the presence of noise by incorporating the following three policies: adaptation of the sample size of a trial solution for its periodic fitness evaluation, expected fitness estimation from the measured noisy fitness samples, and crowding-distance-induced stochastic selection.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Here a nonlinear form (capturing the relationship between the sample size of a trial solution and the fitness variance in its local neighborhood) induced by an exponential function is regarded to efficiently balance the trade-off between runtime complexity and computational accuracy.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, the statistical expectation of the fitness samples is referred to as the “ fitness measure of the trial solutions. ” On the basis of the proposed strategies, Goldberg's method [7] is extended to verify possible accommodation of slightly inferior population members in the optimal Pareto front.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We attempt to realize this strategy in the noisy MOO algorithm by introducing a test criterion on the fitness variance in the local neighborhood of a trial solution to control its sample size.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In other words, the essence of the current work is to induce a trial solution with the information about the sample size (for its periodic fitness evaluation) acquired from the fitness variance in its local neighborhood.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Occurrence probability of the fitness samples: It is evident from the proposed nonuniform partitioning of the sample space that the fitness samples in the longer intervals are rare samples, probably owing to noise, and hence their contribution to the true fitness estimate of {a mathematical formula}X → i should not be regarded similarly to that of the fitness samples in the smaller interval.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It is apparent that for {a mathematical formula} Γ k,i approaching − 1 (or {a mathematical formula} Γ k,i approaching +1), the frequency of the occurrence of fitness samples lying on the left (or right) tail of the fitness sample distribution, far away from {a mathematical formula}f¯k(X → i), is extremely small and these may be regarded as noisy samples [29].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The uncertainty problem is resolved here by weighting the size of the objective space covered by a nondominated solution {a mathematical formula}X → with the probability that {a mathematical formula}X → dominates at least one population member.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The higher the probability, the more reliable the measure of the objective space covered by {a mathematical formula}X → .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For a MOO problem with all objectives to be minimized, the probability of a trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → dominating another solution {a mathematical formula}X → j is given in (25):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Although all the experiments were performed for all five variants of noise with noise variance {a mathematical formula} Σ 2 ∈ [0,1] and also for 10-, 30-, and 50-dimensional problems, we report here the results for finite values of {a mathematical formula} Σ 2, and for specific problem dimensions to save space.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The results omitted follow a trend similar to that in the tables and figures in this section.</a>
