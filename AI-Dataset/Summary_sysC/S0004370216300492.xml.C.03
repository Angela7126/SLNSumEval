<a href="#0" id="0">The variable relates to an underlying universe of discourse Ω , which for the concept ‘ tall ’ could be {a mathematical formula}R+.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then each value L of the variable is associated with a fuzzy subset of Ω , and a function {a mathematical formula} Μ L: Ω → [0,1] associates with each {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Ω the value of its membership in L. Prototype theory gives a semantics for fuzzy set theory through the notion of similarity to a prototype, as described in [15].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A fuzzy set L is defined over a universe Ω via a membership function {a mathematical formula} Μ L: Ω → [0,1].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Elements {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Ω that are very good examples of the concept L have membership close to 1, whereas elements x that are bad examples of the concept have membership close to 0.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These properties are defined as fuzzy sets in a domain {a mathematical formula}Domi.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A concept C is therefore a set of correlations between pairs of properties {a mathematical formula}(a,b) where {a mathematical formula}a,b belong to a set of properties.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, consider the concept {a mathematical formula}Banana.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A context is defined as a set of properties, and the similarity between two concepts {a mathematical formula}C1 and {a mathematical formula}C2 as the mutual subsethood of {a mathematical formula}C1 and {a mathematical formula}C2 relative to that context.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It is defined by:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Cab is the value of the correlation between properties a and b on concept C.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this framework, agents use a set of labels {a mathematical formula}L={L1,L2,...,Ln} to describe an underlying conceptual space Ω which has a distance metric {a mathematical formula}d(x,y) between points.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Each label {a mathematical formula}Li is associated firstly with a set of prototype values {a mathematical formula}Pi ⊆ Ω , and secondly with a threshold {a mathematical formula} Ε i, about which the agents are uncertain.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The thresholds {a mathematical formula} Ε i are drawn from probability distributions {a mathematical formula} Δ i.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The neighbourhood can be seen as the extension of the concept {a mathematical formula}Li.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The intuition here is that {a mathematical formula} Ε i captures the idea of being sufficiently close to prototypes {a mathematical formula}Pi.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">If we view {a mathematical formula}NLi Ε i as a random set from {a mathematical formula}R+ into {a mathematical formula}2 Ω , then {a mathematical formula} Μ Li(x) is the single point coverage function of {a mathematical formula}NLi Ε i, as defined in [32].</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Each label {a mathematical formula}Li is entirely defined by its prototype {a mathematical formula}Pi, the distance metric in the space {a mathematical formula}d(x,y) and the distribution {a mathematical formula} Δ i of the threshold {a mathematical formula} Ε i.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In terms of the prototype-threshold approach outlined above, the membership of an element x in a concept L may then be defined as the similarity to the prototype P of L, where {a mathematical formula} Ε ∼ Exp(c).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">So an attribute like ‘ rounded ’ is seen as a label based in a space such as {a mathematical formula}R3, or ‘ red ’ as based in the CIELab colour space.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">From this perspective, each of the attribute labels can form a binary dimension which are then combined to form the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n where n is the number of attributes.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">4 gives a schematic representation of this model, within which we treat the combination space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}nitself as a conceptual space with an associated metric.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">It is therefore of the following form:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}+Li=Li and {a mathematical formula} − Li=¬Li.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Each atom then naturally defines a point in {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">We think of the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n as the binary conjunction space, and of {a mathematical formula}x → Α as the prototype of the conjunctive concept Α .</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The differing importance of the labels is characterised by a weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → which weights each dimension in the binary space.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">A conjunctive concept is defined by the triple {a mathematical formula} Α =<x → Α ,d, Δ > where Α is an atom of LA, d is a distance on {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n, Ε is a random variable in {a mathematical formula}R+ and Δ is a probability distribution on Ε .</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">We say that an element {a mathematical formula}X → ∈ {0,1}n can be appropriately described by the concept Α iff {a mathematical formula}d(x → Α ,X → ) ≤ Ε with the membership function defined by:{a mathematical formula} We can then relate membership in {a mathematical formula} Ω 1× Ω 2×...× Ω n to membership in the binary space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n as follows.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">We define a binary random variable Z into {a mathematical formula}{0,1} such that:{a mathematical formula} Clearly in this case {a mathematical formula}P(Z=1|X → )= Μ Α (X → ).</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Weighted Hamming distanceFor {a mathematical formula} Λ → ∈ (R+)n,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Suppose that the concept ‘ bird ’ is characterised, for illustrative purposes, by two properties {a mathematical formula}L1= ‘ flies ’ , {a mathematical formula}L2= ‘ has feathers ’ .</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Therefore in this case, the weight on the first dimension, {a mathematical formula} Λ 1 will be smaller than {a mathematical formula} Λ 2.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">We have a vector of weights, {a mathematical formula} Λ → , attached to the binary space which loosely corresponds to Hampton's attribute weights.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">The extent of the atypicality of the attribute {a mathematical formula}Li is then given by the weight {a mathematical formula} Λ i of the corresponding dimension.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">However, we show that by restricting the type of membership function used in the binary combination space, we can derive an expression for the membership function {a mathematical formula} Μ Θ (Y → ) of the compound concept {a mathematical formula} Θ = ⋀ i=1k±Li, {a mathematical formula}k ≤ n as a weighted sum of the membership functions for individual domains {a mathematical formula} Μ ±Li(Yi).</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">We give a definition of convexity for the binary combination spaces {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">We argue that if P does not specify all dimensions of {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n, then the weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → must be such that only those dimensions contributing to the concept are weighted.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Then {a mathematical formula} Λ → =(0.4,0.3,0).</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">So with respect to membership in Θ in the binary space, the weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ ′ produces the same results as the weight vector Λ .</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Let {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P1,d1, Δ 1> and {a mathematical formula} Φ =<P2,d2, Δ 2> be two compound concepts consisting of a conjunction of attribute labels from individual conceptual spaces {a mathematical formula} Ω i.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">We now define the conjunction of compound concepts as the triple {a mathematical formula} Θ ∧ Φ =({(1,1)},d, Δ ) where d is a distance metric on {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">In this case we can define a binary random variable C such that:{a mathematical formula} We also define the membership function for {a mathematical formula} Θ ∧ Φ as follows:{a mathematical formula} So that {a mathematical formula} Μ Θ ∧ Φ (Z → )=P(C=1|Z → ).</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Concept – concept combinationSuppose one concept, {a mathematical formula}SUCCESS, is defined as a conjunction of labels {a mathematical formula}L1= ‘ rich ’ , {a mathematical formula}L2= ‘ healthy ’ , and suppose {a mathematical formula}HAPPY is defined as a conjunction of labels {a mathematical formula}L2= ‘ healthy ’ and {a mathematical formula}L3= ‘ busy ’ .</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Furthermore, suppose {a mathematical formula}SUCCESS is formed in the binary space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2 with prototype set {a mathematical formula}Ps={(1,1)}, weighting {a mathematical formula} Λ s → =(0.75,0.25) and {a mathematical formula} Δ s=U(0,1), i.e.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Within this expanded space, {a mathematical formula}Ps={(1,1,x3):x3 ∈ {0,1}}, i.e., {a mathematical formula}{(1,1,0),(1,1,1)} and {a mathematical formula} Λ → s=(0.75,0.25,0).</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">Similarly, {a mathematical formula}Ph={(x1,1,1):x1 ∈ {0,1}}, and {a mathematical formula} Λ → h=(0,0.5,0.5).</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">We may combine {a mathematical formula} Θ =RED ∧ CAR in the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2 with prototype (1, 1), weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ =(0.5,0.5) and boundary distribution {a mathematical formula} Δ =U(0,1).</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Rather than simply consider the weight {a mathematical formula} Λ → to be the importance of the attribute, we use the idea of necessity from possibility theory [16].</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">{a mathematical formula} Π (s) is a measure on the interval {a mathematical formula}[0,1].</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">Within our model, a state s is considered to be a particular point {a mathematical formula}X → in the binary combination space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n and {a mathematical formula} Π (X → ):= Μ Θ (X → ).</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">To compute the necessity of a dimension i to a concept {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,H Λ → , Δ >, where {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ {0,1}n, we consider the necessity of set {a mathematical formula}Si={X → :Xi=pi}, i.e.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}N Θ Ε is the neighbourhood of Θ as defined in section 3.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">Necessity of a dimensionGiven {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,H Λ → , Δ >, the necessity of a dimension i to Θ is defined as the necessity of the set {a mathematical formula}Si={X → :Xi=pi}, where {a mathematical formula}pi is the ith dimension of {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n, by {a mathematical formula}N(Si)= Δ ({ Ε :N Θ Ε ⊆ Si}).</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">In particular, when {a mathematical formula} Ε ∼ U(0, Λ T), {a mathematical formula}N(Si)= Λ i Λ T.</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">Suppose that two concepts Θ and Φ are combined in the second level space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2, with weight vector {a mathematical formula}w → =(w1,w2) where {a mathematical formula}w1 is associated with Θ and {a mathematical formula}w2 with Φ .</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">Now, if the threshold Ε in the second level space is less than {a mathematical formula}w2, then an element {a mathematical formula}X → of the first level binary space must belong to the neighbourhoods of both concepts Θ and Φ , i.e.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">{a mathematical formula}X → ∈ N Θ Ε Θ ∩ N Φ Ε Φ .</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">When {a mathematical formula}w2 ≤ Ε ≤ w1, the points within Ε in the second level space are {a mathematical formula}{(1,1),(1,0)}, so {a mathematical formula}X → must belong to {a mathematical formula}N Θ Ε Θ , but does not have to belong to {a mathematical formula}N Φ Ε Φ .</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">{a mathematical formula}X → ∈ N Θ Ε Θ ∪ N Φ Ε Φ .</a>
<a href="#57" id="57">For a conjunction {a mathematical formula} Θ ∧ Φ =<{(1,1)},Hw → , Δ >, where {a mathematical formula}w → =(w1,w2) and {a mathematical formula}w2 ≤ w1, the neighbourhood R of {a mathematical formula} Θ ∧ Φ is:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#58" id="58">This allows us to relate the necessity of a dimension to the concept {a mathematical formula} Θ ∧ Φ to the necessity of the dimension to the constituent concepts Θ , Φ since {a mathematical formula}N Θ ∧ Φ (Si)= Δ Θ ∧ Φ ( Ε Θ , Ε Φ :R ⊂ Si).</a>
<a href="#59" id="59">{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#60" id="60">{a mathematical formula} Δ =Uniform(0,wT) ⟹ Δ (w1)=w2wT and {a mathematical formula} Δ (w1)=w1wT{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#61" id="61">The weighted sum of the necessity of attribute i is then {a mathematical formula}0.2×0.9+0.8×0.6=0.66.</a>
<a href="#62" id="62">Now, if {a mathematical formula} Δ =Uniform(0,wT) then {a mathematical formula}N Θ ∧ Φ (Si) is equal to the weighted sum as shown in Corollary 17 and as reported by Hampton.</a>
<a href="#63" id="63">When the distribution of Ε is defined over a narrower range than {a mathematical formula}[0,wT], the importance of attributes in the combined concept is higher than the importance of attributes in either constituent concept, as seen in Fig.</a>
<a href="#64" id="64">Suppose we combine T and F in the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}2 with prototype {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1), weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → =(0.5,0.5), threshold {a mathematical formula} Ε ∼ U(0,1).</a>
<a href="#65" id="65">Say {a mathematical formula} Μ L1(Linda)=0.5{a mathematical formula} Μ L2(Linda)=0.25, {a mathematical formula} Μ L3(Linda)=1, {a mathematical formula} Μ L4(Linda)=1 Then:{a mathematical formula} We argue here that rather than committing a fallacy, the participants are generating a new concept ‘ feminist bank teller ’ with a new prototype.</a>
<a href="#66" id="66">Suppose concept {a mathematical formula}PET= ‘ pet ’ is defined by the conjunction of properties {a mathematical formula}L1= ‘ lives in house ’ , {a mathematical formula}L2= ‘ furry ’ , and {a mathematical formula}FISH= ‘ fish ’ is defined by the conjunction of properties {a mathematical formula}L3= ‘ lives in water ’ , {a mathematical formula}L4= ‘ scaly ’ .</a>
<a href="#67" id="67">Also {a mathematical formula}FISH=<[1,1],H[0.5,0.5],U(0,1)> and {a mathematical formula} Μ FISH(Y → )=0.5 Μ L3(Y3)+0.5 Μ L4(Y4).</a>
<a href="#68" id="68">This gives:{a mathematical formula}Suppose the two concepts PET and {a mathematical formula}FISH are combined in a higher level binary combination space with prototype {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1), dimension weights {a mathematical formula} Λ → =[0.5,0.5] and {a mathematical formula} Ε ∼ U(0,1.25).</a>
<a href="#69" id="69">Now, from section 4.3.2 we have{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}X → ∈ {0,1}4, i.e.</a>
<a href="#70" id="70">8, {a mathematical formula}Z → ∈ {0,1}2, i.e.</a>
<a href="#71" id="71">8, and {a mathematical formula}gi refers to the ith dimension of ‘ goldfish ’ , {a mathematical formula}i=1,...,4.</a>
<a href="#72" id="72">Then {a mathematical formula} Μ PET ∧ FISH(cat)=0.6< Μ PET ∧ FISH(g).</a>
<a href="#73" id="73">{a mathematical formula} Λ → PET.</a>
<a href="#74" id="74">Choosing {a mathematical formula} Λ → PET=[0.75,0.25] with the other values the same does not produce the same set of inequalities.</a>
<a href="#75" id="75">Secondly, consider an entity for which {a mathematical formula} Μ Li(Yi)=0 ∀ i, i.e.</a>
<a href="#76" id="76">This objection may be dealt with, however, by choosing a distribution for Ε for which {a mathematical formula} Δ (1)=0.</a>
<a href="#77" id="77">Lastly, an entity for which {a mathematical formula} Μ Li(Yi)=1 ∀ i will have a higher membership in ‘ pet fish ’ than the goldfish, since the prototype for a pet fish which we have specified here is something that lives in the house and is furry and lives in water and is scaly.</a>
