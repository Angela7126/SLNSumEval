<a href="#0" id="0">We denote the social welfare of the coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A) by {a mathematical formula}SW(P) (see, e.g., [35]):{a mathematical formula} When we need to explicitly identify the edges of the social network E (with the corresponding weight function) in a social welfare computation, we will write {a mathematical formula}SW(P,E).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We proceed to examine the performance of the heuristic compared to the maximal social welfare that is found by the optimal algorithm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In most of the instances that we checked the heuristic found a coalition structure with the maximal social welfare.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Specifically, we used the Slashdot, S1 and Kronecker networks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We set Α to {a mathematical formula}1,2 and fixed k to be 3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We varied the number of agents between 10 – 50.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Overall, we tested 600 different instances, and we found the following relative differences between the solution of the heuristic and the maximal social welfare:</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Definition 12</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">K-C-Membership: Given: {a mathematical formula}G=(A,E, Ω ), the social network (E may contain positive and negative edges), and a coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Question: Is P a member of the k-coalitions-core?</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">where {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is a coalition structure maximizing the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">State: A coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Initial state: A coalition structure maximizing the social welfare, {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Theorem 13</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The social welfare of the coalition structure returned by the heuristic is at least{a mathematical formula}SW ⁎ 2, where{a mathematical formula}SW ⁎ is the maximal social welfare.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">A deviation may affect several edges.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Let {a mathematical formula}Sum − be the contribution to the social welfare of P of edges that will not contribute to the social welfare of {a mathematical formula}P ′ , i.e., the edges between agents that will no longer be members of the same coalition after the deviation.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Let {a mathematical formula}Sum+ be the contribution to the social welfare of {a mathematical formula}P ′ of edges that are not contributing to the social welfare of P, i.e., the edges between agents that will become members of the same coalition after the deviation.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">We observe that:</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Random: In 97% of the cases a member of the strict k-coalitions-core was found within {a mathematical formula}10,000 iterations.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In 11% of the cases the initial coalition structure was not a member of the core, but if a member of the core was found it also had the maximal social welfare.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The average number of iterations was 36 steps.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Definition 17</a>
