<a href="#0" id="0">Constraint networkA constraint network over a given vocabulary {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,D 〉 is a finite set C of constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The set of all solutions of a constraint network C is denoted {a mathematical formula}sol(C).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A representation of a concept f is a constraint network C for which {a mathematical formula}f − 1(1)=sol(C).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A constraint network {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ B is maximally specific (resp.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is done by expanding the theory with a unit clause {a mathematical formula}¬a(c) for each constraint c in {a mathematical formula} Κ (x(e)).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">So, there is at least one constraint in C that is included in {a mathematical formula} Κ (x(e)).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">So, there is no constraint in C that belongs to {a mathematical formula} Κ (x(e)).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula} Consider the constraint network {a mathematical formula}C={ ≤ 12, ≤ 23}.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Suppose that the target network is {a mathematical formula}C={=12,=13,=23}.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let B be a constraint bias, E a set of examples, and T be the clausal encoding of {a mathematical formula}CB(E).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The expected number t of constraints in the {a mathematical formula} Κ [T](q) of the query q we will generate is set to the value corresponding to the strategy we use.</a>
