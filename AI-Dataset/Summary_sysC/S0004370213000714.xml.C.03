<a href="#0" id="0">The least-core of the game Γ is the {a mathematical formula} Ε min-core of Γ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We say a coalition of agents {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ I can perform a task {a mathematical formula}tj if every skill required to perform the task is owned by some agent in the coalition, so {a mathematical formula}S(tj) ⊆ S(C).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We denote the set of tasks a coalition C can perform as {a mathematical formula}T(C).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">CSGA CSG is the coalitional game Γ in a coalitional skill domain, where the players are the agents of the coalitional skill domain, and the characteristic function of a coalition is the value of the tasks that coalition can perform: {a mathematical formula}v Γ (C)=u(T(C)).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since in order to complete the task a coalition needs both skills, a winning coalition must contain {a mathematical formula}a1 and one of the two agents {a mathematical formula}a2,a3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, for any skill {a mathematical formula}sL the coalition W covers {a mathematical formula}sL, so W covers all the skills and is a winning coalition.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For any coalition {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ I we have {a mathematical formula}(v1+v2)(C)=v1(C)+v2(C).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let I be the set of agents in {a mathematical formula}v1 and {a mathematical formula}v2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, {a mathematical formula}vm(C)=v(C) for any coalition C, so this is a WTSG representation for G, as required.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let {a mathematical formula} Γ j be the STSG with the single task {a mathematical formula}tj, with the same agents and skills as Γ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For every agent {a mathematical formula}ai there is a winning coalition that does not contain {a mathematical formula}ai.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The characteristic function of the game is defined on the set of skills that a coalition has: {a mathematical formula}v:2S → R.</a>
