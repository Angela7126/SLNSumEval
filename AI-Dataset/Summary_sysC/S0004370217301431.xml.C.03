<a href="#0" id="0">We can now define a STPUD planning problem P as a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 V,I,T,A,G 〉 where:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Intuitively, an element {a mathematical formula} 〈 t,a,d 〉 indicates the start of an instance of the action a at time t, with duration d if a is a controllable action.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">2 graphically shows a valid strong plan {a mathematical formula} Π ex for the running example.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} Note that all the actions in {a mathematical formula} Π ex have uncontrollable duration; hence, the strong plan does not specify their duration (durations are replaced by ⊥ ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, consider an effect {a mathematical formula} 〈 [eta]f:=v 〉 and suppose the action a ends at absolute time 10.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Projected problem plan validityGiven a projected problem {a mathematical formula}ctrl(P)= ˙ 〈 V,I,T,A,G 〉 , a plan Π is valid if the following conditions hold:</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, plan {a mathematical formula} Π lb is not a valid strong plan.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Formally, a TN is a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,C 〉 where X is a set of time points and C is a set of temporal constraints.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We indicate a step corresponding to an instance of action a as {a mathematical formula}sa.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula} This very same example of an abstract plan that works for finding the plan {a mathematical formula} Π ex also works in the other approaches in this section.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Given a variable f, a value v and a pair of action instances a and r of Χ , we define the disjunctive temporal constraint {a mathematical formula} Ρ (f,v,a,r) as follows.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In this section, we present our compilation technique, which can be used to reduce any planning instance P having duration uncertainty into a temporal planning instance {a mathematical formula}P ′ in which all actions have controllable durations.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">{a mathematical formula} Intuitively, this is the set of variables that can possibly have uncertain value during plan execution.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For example, consider the effect {a mathematical formula}e1= ˙ 〈 [ettrans]sent:=T 〉 of action {a mathematical formula}trans.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The compilation of the {a mathematical formula}trans action is depicted in Fig.</a>

<a href="#18" id="18">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">For example, if a has duration in {a mathematical formula}[l,u] and has an end-relative effect {a mathematical formula} 〈 [eta − Δ ]f:=v 〉 , no other action could have a condition or effect on f that might occur within {a mathematical formula}[l − Δ ,u − Δ ].</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">To make this more precise, let {a mathematical formula}a ′ be the extension of action a to its maximal duration u.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">This also applies to overall conditions since the extended action {a mathematical formula}a ′ still has an overall condition that covers the maximum possible duration of the original action a.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">An action b cannot overlap with action {a mathematical formula}a ′ if any of the following hold:</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">b has an overall condition inconsistent with an overall condition of {a mathematical formula}a ′ ;</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">{a mathematical formula} The resulting simplified problem now has one uncontrollable action and one controllable action, without any additional variables or conditions.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">In fact, a plan starting the move action at time 1 would be valid in the simplified problem, but it does not yield a strong plan because the uncontrollable action {a mathematical formula}move could end at time 11 and the ending condition {a mathematical formula} 〈 [etmove]hot=F 〉 would be unsatisfied.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">For example, if a has duration in {a mathematical formula}[l,u] and has an end-relative effect {a mathematical formula} 〈 [eta − Δ ]f:=v 〉 , no other action could have a condition or effect on f that might occur within {a mathematical formula}[l − Δ ,u − Δ ].</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">For each end-relative condition {a mathematical formula} 〈 [(t,eta ′ − Δ 2] Φ 〉 :</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">For each end-relative condition {a mathematical formula} 〈 [(t,eta ′ − Δ 2) Φ 〉 :</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Finally, the intervals mentioned in the above requirements often extend beyond the duration of the action {a mathematical formula}a ′ .</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Then, {a mathematical formula}fce becomes a condition for starting and terminating each action in the problem except for the clip c and the two clipped actions a and b.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Consider a plan Σ for R, with actions {a mathematical formula}ai at time {a mathematical formula}ti and having duration {a mathematical formula}di.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">We call {a mathematical formula} Π Σ the regression plan for P when it has actions {a mathematical formula}ai Π corresponding to the actions {a mathematical formula}ai in Σ such that:</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Analogously, we call {a mathematical formula} Σ Π the projection plan for R of a strong plan Π for P obtained by fixing the duration of each uncontrollable action in Π to its maximum.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">{a mathematical formula}EfR is either a TIL or an initial condition and {a mathematical formula}EfP is the effect of action a:</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">{a mathematical formula}EfP and {a mathematical formula}EfR are both effects of two action instances a and {a mathematical formula}a ′ ; there are four possible sub-cases:</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">{a mathematical formula}EfR is either a TIL or an initial condition and {a mathematical formula}EfP is the effect of an action a.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">{a mathematical formula}EfP is either a TIL or an initial condition and {a mathematical formula}EfR is an action effect.</a>
