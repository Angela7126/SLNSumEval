<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we will adopt the definition of logics given by Tarski, under which a logic is a pair {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}L is the set of expressions (propositions) of the underlying language and {a mathematical formula}Cn:2L ↦ 2L is a function mapping sets of propositions to sets of propositions (consequence operator).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Furthermore, closure under connectives is a syntactic requirement, so, e.g., ¬a is a unique proposition, and no assumptions are made as to its semantics; on the other hand, complementarity is semantic, so the complement of A as defined above has a specific semantics, and there could be several complements of a single belief (or even none at all).Supra-classicality:A logic {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 that is closed under the standard logical connectives ({a mathematical formula} ∧ , ∨ , → ,¬) is supra-classical iff for all A, {a mathematical formula}Cn(A) contains all classical consequences of A[3].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, the problem is that several Boolean logics do not satisfy the ascending chain condition, so we can construct infinite chains of beliefs that do not imply A, and which have no maximum; as a result, {a mathematical formula}K ⊥ A may “ miss ” some maximal elements and it could even be the case that {a mathematical formula}K ⊥ A= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}K − A is an AGM-relevance contraction operator iff there is a selection function Γ such that {a mathematical formula}K − A= ⋂ Γ (K ⊥ A).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">( ⇒ ) To see that every operator − satisfying the six postulates can be constructed as a partial meet contraction, just define the selection function Γ as {a mathematical formula} Γ (K ⊥ A)={K} when {a mathematical formula}K ⊥ A= ∅ and {a mathematical formula} Γ (K ⊥ A)={X ∈ K ⊥ A:K − A ⊆ X} otherwise.First we need to prove that Γ is well defined, i.e.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For Boolean logics, partial meet contraction is not necessarily equivalent with neither the AGM postulates, nor the AGM-relevance postulates.Let {a mathematical formula}R be the set of real numbers, and {a mathematical formula}Q the set of rational numbers.</a>
