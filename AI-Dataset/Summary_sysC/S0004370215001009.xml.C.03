<a href="#1" id="1">The definition does not exactly define a probability distribution as it contains imprecise knowledge, but we can define a probability distribution consistent with the definition for those two random variables by the following assignments:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} From this one can compute the probability of for instance {a mathematical formula}P(DM=true):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This has to be done in such a way that the probability measure P of the original probability space assigns a probability to each event concerning the random variable {a mathematical formula}Vi as well.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} Ω V is the sample space of the random variables V defined as the Cartesian product of the random variables' ranges:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}AV is an event space representing events concerning the random variables V;</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the running example of Section 2.3:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Suppose that {a mathematical formula}Time_Comp1 and {a mathematical formula}Time_Comp2 are the only two random variables in the enumeration.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Assume the first two random variables in the sample space have as range the set {a mathematical formula}{sun,rain} and {a mathematical formula}C1={(0.2,{sun,rain}),(0.8,{sun})}.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">This credal set specification for instance includes the case that {a mathematical formula} Ω 1 and {a mathematical formula} Ω 2 are independent and normally distributed with mean 0.0 and arbitrary standard deviation.Suppose we want to compute the probability of the event {a mathematical formula}2 Ω 1> Ω 2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Definitions have the form:{a mathematical formula} where each {a mathematical formula}Vi is a random variable label, {a mathematical formula}Xi is a parameter, {a mathematical formula}pi is a probability and {a mathematical formula} Φ i is a constraint.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The {a mathematical formula} Φ i are constraint definitions using the {a mathematical formula}Vi as placeholder for the random variables.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Each {a mathematical formula} Φ i must be consistent, to make sure all probability mass is assigned to non-empty events.</a>
