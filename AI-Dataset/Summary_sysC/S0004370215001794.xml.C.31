<a href="#0" id="0">In scientific computing and in realistic graphic animation, simulation – that is, step-by-step calculation of the complete trajectory of a physical system – is one of the most common and important modes of calculation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this article, we address the scope and limits of the use of simulation, with respect to AI tasks that involve high-level physical reasoning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We argue that, in many cases, simulation can play at most a limited role.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Simulation is most effective when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of scales involved, both temporal and spatial, is not extreme.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When these conditions do not hold, simulation is less effective or entirely inappropriate.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We discuss twelve features of physical reasoning problems that pose challenges for simulation-based reasoning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We briefly survey alternative techniques for physical reasoning that do not rely on simulation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">One common method for using simulations in situations with partial knowledge is to use Monte Carlo methods, or probabilistic simulation [26], [49].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given a probability distribution over a space of physical situations, a program generates some large collection of specific situations following the distribution; it carries out a simulation based on each of these; and then it considers these behaviors as a random sample of the possible behaviors.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then for any particular proposition Φ of interest, the probability that Φ will be true in the actual situation can be estimated as the fraction of simulations in which Φ is true.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Conditional probabilities can be computed in a similar way: to calculate the conditional probability {a mathematical formula}P( Φ | Λ ), generate random scenarios satisfying Λ and find the fraction of these that satisfy Φ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This technique can be adapted to situations in which one starts with a set of constraints rather than a distribution by using a distribution that is, in some sense, uniform over the space of situations satisfying the constraints.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In modeling and simulation, irrelevancies are generally excluded manually.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The human being who sets up the simulation formulates the problem in terms of the relevant features and ignores the irrelevant ones.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">However, this expedient will not do for a general AI program or a cognitive theory.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">There must be a well-defined process to exclude irrelevant information in physical reasoning, and it is hard to see how this exclusion process itself can rely on simulation.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">If there is a human in the loop, they can examine the output of the simulator and at least see that this cannot be right, particularly if the simulator outputs an animation.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">If there is no human in the loop, then it would be very desirable for the physical reasoning system to be able to detect these kinds of problems by itself.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">If the simulation is the only reasoning mechanism, this cannot be done.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Simulation is effective for automated physical reasoning when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of scales involved, both temporal and spatial, is not extreme.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">If these conditions do not hold, then simulation becomes to some extent problematic.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">We have identified many categories of problems where these conditions do not hold, and demonstrated by examples that these categories include many natural and simple examples.</a>
