<a href="#0" id="0">We then apply the extended matrix factorization method {a mathematical formula}fTL in the transfer learning manner on both the source and target collaborative data to learn an updated CF model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that the entity selection function {a mathematical formula}ActiveLearn() is built on top of the base method f at the initial step or the extended method {a mathematical formula}fTL at each iteration.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section, we present a second particular solution with RLMF.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We start by introducing an extended RLMF method in the transfer learning manner with flexible entity correspondences between the source and the target systems, and then present an active entity selection approach to constructing cross-system correspondences based on the extended RLMF.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, we present the third solution based on PMF.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We start by introducing an extended PMF method in the transfer learning manner with partial entity correspondences between the source and the target systems, and then present an active entity correspondences construction approach accordingly.</a>
