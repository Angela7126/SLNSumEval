<a href="#0" id="0">When only a small number of the concepts can be fully classified by {a mathematical formula}EL axioms alone, its effect on improving reasoning efficiency might not be significant.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Considering the {a mathematical formula}T1 in Example 1, it is easy to derive the following axiom:{a mathematical formula} Given this, it is sufficient to derive the following axiom, in which we use underline to highlight the expressions appearing in the above axiom:{a mathematical formula} Note that this can be achieved by a tractable inference rule:{a mathematical formula} or the combination of two tractable inference rules:{a mathematical formula} Although there are other more complex axioms in {a mathematical formula}T1, such as axiom (4), they are not necessarily required in this step of inference.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given the R rules, we define a syntactic notion of nominal-safety: Syntactic nominal-safety under approximate reasoningAn ontology {a mathematical formula}O is syntactic nominal-safe under approximate reasoning if {a mathematical formula}TAfa(O)=(T,CT,QT,IT) satisfies the following syntactic properties, where A is a concept such that A, {a mathematical formula}fc(A) ∈ CNT, {a mathematical formula}B(i) is an arbitrary concept, a and b are individuals and r is a named role:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Similar as Theorem 2, this theorem can be proved by showing that {a mathematical formula}O ∪ O ′ ∪ Tfa conservatively extends both {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}O ′ on {a mathematical formula} Σ O, where {a mathematical formula}Tfa is the set of definition {a mathematical formula}fa(P) ≡ P for all term P of {a mathematical formula}O except complement of roles.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The above theorem shows that when a nominal-free ontology contains no role chains except the role transitivity axioms, its ABox approximate reasoning can be significantly simplified due to the fact that intermediate results of form {a mathematical formula}a: ∃ r.A no longer need to be computed and maintained.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If we use SI to denote{a mathematical formula}SIfa(O), and SC to denote{a mathematical formula}SCfa(O), then the following invariants hold in each step of computation of SI, where{a mathematical formula}a,b ∈ INOare two individuals,{a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ CNTare two concepts, and{a mathematical formula}r ∈ RNOis a role:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A difference is that, the transformation presented in Definition 4 introduces a pair {a mathematical formula}(fa(C),fa(~C)) into CT for each term C in the ontology, even if C is an {a mathematical formula}EL++ concept, and such a structure will be exploited by the additional rules.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Hence, the closure computed by our approach will be larger than that computed by the original {a mathematical formula}EL++ rules even when applied on {a mathematical formula}EL++ ontologies.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our approach can infer that {a mathematical formula}X ⊑ Y with the extended rule set.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If the ontology contains multiple cardinality restriction axioms of form (96) with different values of N, in worst case, the algorithm still needs to perform {a mathematical formula}2k searches, where k is bounded by the size of the concept vocabulary.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It can be recovered if the rule set is extended with the following rule, where C is of form {a mathematical formula}A1 ⊓ ⋯ ⊓ An(n ≥ 1):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In fact, a more generalised variation of the above rule is used in consequence-based algorithms for Horn-{a mathematical formula}SHIQ[41] and {a mathematical formula}ALCH[73] to deal with similar forms of interactions between existential restrictions and inverse roles (note that an {a mathematical formula}ALCH axiom of form {a mathematical formula}X ⊑ ∀ r.B is equivalent to the axiom (100) in our example).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Nevertheless, the computational price is that such a rule will generate consequences of form {a mathematical formula}X ⊑ ∃ r.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Note that an axiom of form {a mathematical formula} ∃ R. ⊤ ⊑ B is essentially a range restriction of {a mathematical formula}inv(R) and can always be eliminated without affecting the semantics of the TBox [1].</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since {a mathematical formula}~C and {a mathematical formula}~D are terms, by structural induction we have {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊨ {fa(~C) ≡ ¬C, {a mathematical formula}fa(~D) ≡ ¬D}.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Since {a mathematical formula}~C ⊓ ~D is also a term, by Definition 4 we also have {a mathematical formula}fa(~C ⊓ ~D) ≡ fa(~C) ⊓ fa(~D).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">By Step-2 of Theorem 2 we also have {a mathematical formula}fa(C ⊔ D) ≡ ¬fa(~C ⊓ ~D) ∈ T ′ .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Together we can infer that {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊨ Β ;</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Similar as Theorem 2, this theorem can be proved by showing that {a mathematical formula}O ∪ O ′ ∪ Tfa conservatively extends both {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}O ′ on {a mathematical formula} Σ O, where {a mathematical formula}Tfa is the set of definition {a mathematical formula}fa(P) ≡ P for all term P of {a mathematical formula}O except complement of roles.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Note that when the ontology {a mathematical formula}O is nominal free, {a mathematical formula}T does not contain any nominal or names for complement of nominal.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Hence {a mathematical formula}CNT also does not include names for complement of nominal.Before we prove the → direction, we analyse the forms of axioms in SI.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">We make a case distinction on the form of X:</a>
