<a href="#0" id="0">In the case of a finite number of random variables with finite ranges, one can uniquely define a joint probability distribution P by assigning a probability number to each joint assignment of values {a mathematical formula}vi ∈ Rangei,i=1, … ,n, to random variables {a mathematical formula}P(V1=v1, … ,Vn=vn).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to define this semantics for arbitrary constraints, we extend the sample space by considering all atoms appearing in the logical theory L. We assume there is a countable number of atoms, treat them as random variables taking values true or false and denote the set of all those atoms with A.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As for variables in V we fix the enumeration and define the sample space {a mathematical formula} Ω L being the Cartesian product of the values of all atoms:{a mathematical formula} For the event space of the logic part of the theory {a mathematical formula}AL, we can take the sample space's powerset, since the sample space is countable:{a mathematical formula} The sample space for the entire theory {a mathematical formula} Ω T is the Cartesian product of the sample spaces for the random variables and the logical theory:{a mathematical formula} The event space of the entire theory {a mathematical formula}AT is built as well from the event spaces of the random variables and logical theory.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The lower and upper probability bounds of a query q, concerning only the first n random variables, in a PCLP program, fulfilling the exact inference conditions, can be computed as:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}HereCis the credal set specification defined by the program (Lemma 4).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The number of resulting CNFs is bounded by {a mathematical formula}dt, as the size of the node is bounded by t and for each random variables at most d choices can be made.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, the number of choices which are incorporated into each of those CNFs is bounded by t. The complexity of the computation is therefore {a mathematical formula}O(tdt), if we do not consider the recursive calls to OGWMC for the decomposed sub-CNFs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The reason for this is that not all sub-CNFs are different and we can exploit that using caching (Line 3 of Algorithm 2) and the number of distinct sub-CNFs is bounded.All sub-CNFs passed to further recursive calls do not include any of the variables of s. Either they are eliminated by simplification or they were included in an imprecise constraint.</a>
