<a href="#0" id="0">Note that both Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ are extensions of {a mathematical formula}PA. Once again, take the profile Π consisting of {a mathematical formula}n/2 instances of Σ and {a mathematical formula}n/2 instances of {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First, we show that {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ Bt( Π ) only if equality in Equation (5) holds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To see why, note that the footrule distance is always even and {a mathematical formula}r=dFR ↓ (2t) ≥ ⌊ 2t ⌋ − 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence, if equality is not achieved, then {a mathematical formula}dFR( Ρ , Σ )+dFR( Ρ , Σ ′ ) ≥ r+2 ≥ ⌊ 2t ⌋ − 1+1>2t.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, the average distance of Ρ from votes in Π would be greater than t.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that {a mathematical formula} Σ , Σ ′ ∈ Bt( Π ) and {a mathematical formula}dFR( Σ , Σ ′ )=r (this distance is given by the summation in Equation (5)).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, {a mathematical formula}D(Bt( Π )) ≥ r.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Now, we prove that its minimax distance is at least r as well.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Take a ranking {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ L(A).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We need to show that there exists some {a mathematical formula} Τ ∈ Bt( Π ) such that {a mathematical formula}dFR( Ρ , Τ ) ≥ r.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Every ranking Ρ that achieves equality in Equation (8) is clearly in {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) because its average distance from the votes in Π is {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ /2 ≤ t.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Further, every ranking Ρ that achieves a strict inequality in Equation (8) is outside {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) because its average distance from the votes in Π is at least {a mathematical formula}( ⌊ 2t ⌋ +1)/2>t.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Hence, {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) consists of rankings that satisfy {a mathematical formula}dCY( Ρ , Σ )+dCY( Ρ , Σ ′ )= ⌊ 2t ⌋ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Consider the profile Π consisting of {a mathematical formula}n/2 instances of Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ each.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Clearly, Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ have an average distance of {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ /2 ≤ t from rankings in Π .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Hence, {a mathematical formula}{ Σ , Σ ′ } ∈ Bt( Π ).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Surprisingly, in this case we can show that the minimax distance of {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) without any additional information regarding the structure of {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Take a ranking {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ L(A).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The alternative placed first in Ρ must be ranked at a position {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ or below in at least one of Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Hence, {a mathematical formula}max ⁡ (dMD( Ρ , Σ ),dMD( Ρ , Σ ′ )) ≥ ⌊ 2t ⌋ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Thus, there exists a ranking in {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) at distance at least {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ from Ρ , i.e., the minimax distance of {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) is at least {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ , as desired.</a>
