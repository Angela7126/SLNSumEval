<a href="#0" id="0">We prove with Lemma 1 and Proposition 1 that the overall argument classification introduced in Definition 12 complies with the properties of an argument fallibility classification stated in Definition 10.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For this reason, whenever an incremental fallibility classification {a mathematical formula}FI ⁎ Δ is considered, the symbol {a mathematical formula}FI will denote the overall argument classification associated to {a mathematical formula}FI ⁎ Δ , which will be directly called the argument fallibility classification associated to {a mathematical formula}FI ⁎ Δ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Concerning the notion of argument (Definition 7) we can assume that every argument Α satisfying Definition 38 is assigned a distinct identifier {a mathematical formula}AI( Α ) and has a conclusion {a mathematical formula}Conc( Α ) as prescribed by Definition 38.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Having examined the notions concerning the internal structure of arguments and their properties, let us move to their conflicts and hence to the inhibition relation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In AAS argument construction refers to base sets (Definition 47) namely compatible subsets of {a mathematical formula}L and a special symbol ⊥ is used to represents contradiction and it is assumed that contradiction is detected by producing it as conclusion of an argument (Definition 45).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We aim now at defining a set based argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}FLE= 〈 AA, ↠ 〉 (Definition 28) capturing the notion of argument acceptance in AAS.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Concerning the notion of argument (Definition 7), every argument Α satisfying Definition 62 has a conclusion {a mathematical formula}Conc( Α ) as prescribed by Definition 62 and we can assume that a distinct identifier {a mathematical formula}AI( Α ) is assigned to each argument.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As to the notion of attackable elements, we adopt a very simple one: if the top rule of an argument Α is defeasible then its name is the only attackable element of Α , otherwise Α has no attackable elements.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We restrict our consideration to systems where for every argument Α the set {a mathematical formula}Sub( Α ) is finite.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As pointed out in [13], Definition 62 allows arguments which are ‘ backward ’ infinite and hence have an infinite set of subarguments.</a>
