<a href="#11" id="11">Rule activationGiven a GAP Π , a property p, and a rule {a mathematical formula}r ∈ Π , we define {a mathematical formula}relbody(r)={AA|AA is an annotated atom in the body of r and its predicate symbol is not in {a mathematical formula}R Π ,p}.</a>

<a href="#14" id="14">for every {a mathematical formula}AA ∈ relbody(r ′ ), {a mathematical formula} Π S ⊨ AA;</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Definition 3</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Necessary and unnecessary verticesLet {a mathematical formula}S be an SN, Π be a GAP, and p a property.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">A vertex of {a mathematical formula}S is necessary if it activates a rule of {a mathematical formula} Π p, otherwise it is unnecessary.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Proof</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">If a vertex v is unnecessary, it cannot activate any rule in Π , thus, independent of whether or not it has the diffusion property p, it does contribute to diffusing p to other vertices (see item 2 of Definition 2).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">It follows that{a mathematical formula} If a vertex v is necessary, all the rules it activates contain necessary vertices, and then we have that{a mathematical formula} It follows that {a mathematical formula}dc Π ,p,S(v)=dc Π ,p,S ′ (v).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Recall that, given a GAP Π and a property p, then {a mathematical formula} Π p is the set of rules r in Π such that either p depends on the head predicate symbol of r or p is the head predicate symbol.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">We also define{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We now define a hypergraph that captures how a property p diffuses through an SN {a mathematical formula}S according to a GAP Π .</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The hypergraph does not depend on which vertices have property p in the original SN, but depends only on Π and the structure of {a mathematical formula}S in terms of edges and vertex properties other than p. Therefore, given a GAP Π and an SN{a mathematical formula}S, the diffusion hypergraph has to be computed only once and can be used with different assignments of a property p to the vertices of{a mathematical formula}S. This allows us to save time in computing diffusion centrality which requires computing the least fixed point for different initial assignments of p. However, if the SN changes, the diffusion hypergraph needs to be recomputed.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">In addition, the hypergraph allows us to eliminate diffusion rules that are useless for computing the least fixed point.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Definition 12</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Diffusion centrality on a coarsened networkLet {a mathematical formula}S be a social network, {a mathematical formula}SC=(VC,EC,VLC, Ω C) be a coarsening of {a mathematical formula}S with vertex mapping Π , and mvw be a function assigning a weight to each vertex in {a mathematical formula}VC.</a>
