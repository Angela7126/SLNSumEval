<a href="#0" id="0">The proposed error-based active learning approach thus aims to select a set of queries {a mathematical formula}Q at each iteration to construct K more correspondences between the source and the target system in addition to the existing set of correspondences such that the resulting new CF model obtains lower generalization error than any other set of queries {a mathematical formula}Q â€² of K correspondences construction, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}C is the set of cross-system correspondences used in the current CF model, which can be empty.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From the figure, we can find that as {a mathematical formula}MTL aims to exploit cross-system entity correspondences to transfer knowledge from the source system to the target system, the computational time increases when the number of the constructed cross-system entity correspondences increases.</a>
