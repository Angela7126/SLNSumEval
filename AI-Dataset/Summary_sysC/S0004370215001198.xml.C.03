<a href="#0" id="0">The set of coalition structures over C will be denoted by {a mathematical formula} Π C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Such a coalition structure is said to be “ optimal ” , and is denoted by {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Observe that every coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π A represents a possible solution to the coalition structure generation problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As such, the terms “ coalition structure ” , “ partition ” , and “ solution ” will be used interchangeably, and {a mathematical formula} Π A will often be referred to as the “ search space ” .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For instance, {a mathematical formula} Π {1,1,2}{a1,a2,a3,a4} is the subspace consisting of all the coalition structures within which two coalitions are of size 1 and one coalition is of size 2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Suppose for the sake of contradiction that {a mathematical formula}CS ′ was not an optimal coalition structure over {a mathematical formula}C ′ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">single coalition structure in{a mathematical formula} Π ″ , namely {a mathematical formula}CS ″ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This process is repeated until all coalition structures in {a mathematical formula} Π IA have been visited.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let us denote this coalition by {a mathematical formula}C ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This implies that any such coalition structure is guaranteed to be within a bound {a mathematical formula} Β =r according to the following theorem:</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The problem of finding an optimal coalition structure is then equivalent to the problem of finding a feasible set of rules {a mathematical formula}R ′ such that {a mathematical formula} ∑ r ∈ R ′ Θ r is maximized.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If condition (24) is not satisfied, then there exists a coalition whose value in some coalition structure {a mathematical formula} Π A is greater than its value in any of the coalition structures in {a mathematical formula} Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">upper bound on the value of the best coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π IA.</a>
