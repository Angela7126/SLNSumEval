<a href="#0" id="0">We also remark that Theorem 1 admits a simple proof, but the bound is nontrivial: while the average error of the profile is at most t (hence, the profile contains a ranking with error at most t), it is generally impossible to pinpoint a single ranking within the profile that has error at most 2t with respect to the ground truth in the worst-case (i.e., with respect to every possible ground truth in {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π )).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Theorem 4 improves the bounds on {a mathematical formula}k(t) to {a mathematical formula}d ↓ (t) ≤ k(t) ≤ d ↓ (2t) for a variety of distance metrics d. However, for the four special distance metrics considered in this paper, the next result, which is our main theoretical result, closes this gap by establishing a tight lower bound of {a mathematical formula}d ↓ (2t), for a wide range of values of n and t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Every ranking Ρ that achieves equality in Equation (8) is clearly in {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) because its average distance from the votes in Π is {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ /2 ≤ t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Further, every ranking Ρ that achieves a strict inequality in Equation (8) is outside {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) because its average distance from the votes in Π is at least {a mathematical formula}( ⌊ 2t ⌋ +1)/2>t.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) consists of rankings that satisfy {a mathematical formula}dCY( Ρ , Σ )+dCY( Ρ , Σ ′ )= ⌊ 2t ⌋ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Now, any ranking Ρ satisfying equality in Equation (8) must be consistent with exactly one of Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ in each of first {a mathematical formula}2 ⌊ 2t ⌋ positions, and with both Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ in the later positions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The former condition implies that for every {a mathematical formula}i ∈ ⌊ 2t ⌋ , Ρ must place the pair of alternatives {a mathematical formula}(ai,a2 ⌊ 2t ⌋ +1 − i) in positions i and {a mathematical formula}2 ⌊ 2t ⌋ +1 − i, either according to Σ or according to {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the case of even n, the proofs for all four distance metrics proceeded as follows: Given the feasible distance {a mathematical formula}r=d ↓ (2t), we constructed two rankings Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ at distance r from each other such that {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) is the set of rankings at minimal total distance from the two rankings, i.e.,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In our generic proof for all four distance metrics, we obtain conditions under which {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π )=Bt( Π ′ ) where {a mathematical formula} Π ′ is obtained by removing the arbitrary ranking from Π (and hence has an even number of votes).</a>
