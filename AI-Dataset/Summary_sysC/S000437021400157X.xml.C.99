<a href="#0" id="0">Based on a semantic model about furniture objects (represented in an OWL-DL ontology with rules attached), we generate hypotheses for locations and 6DoF poses of object instances and verify them by matching a geometric model of the object (given as a CAD model) into the point cloud.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The result, in addition to the registered point cloud, is a consistent mesh representation of the environment, further enriched by object models corresponding to the detected pieces of furniture.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Incremental means that the semantic map building process does not have to wait for the sensor data of some scene or environment to be complete (no matter how such completeness would have to be defined and determined), but has to start right away, based on individual sensor takes, such as single RGB-D frames or 3D laser scans.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The approach detailed in this paper combines a number of techniques that make it suitable for being used in on-line, incremental semantic mapping, starting from a stream of RGB-D frames: meshing of 3D points and referring to geometric features are used to compensate sensor noise and aperture limitations, and early closed-loop usage of the semantic knowledge is used to generate object hypotheses for guiding low-level sensor data processing.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">1), consisting of three steps: (1) surface reconstruction (Section 3.1), as an instance of geometric primitive detection, transforms the input point cloud into a triangle mesh and extracts planar regions; (2) planar region classification (Section 3.2), as an instance of hypothesis generation, classifies the planar regions, detects furniture objects, and calculates initial pose estimates based on the planar regions; (3) final pose adjustment (Section 3.3), as an instance of hypothesis verification, computes the final pose using ICP, and places the corresponding CAD model in the scene.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The initial pose estimate calculated in the previous step is potentially inaccurate, since it wholly depends on an abstraction of the recognized objects as sets of planar regions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Solving this problem requires closing the loop from the output of our reasoning process back to the low-level sensor data.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Also, the physical object might differ from the CAD model for other reasons (e.g., damage or other modifications).</a>
