<a href="#0" id="0">The kernel of D – S theory is Dempster ʼ s rule that was originally adopted as the sole ECR to combine independent evidence that is fully reliable.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By fully reliable evidence, it is meant that a proposition will not be supported at all if it is ruled out by the evidence.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The rule adopts the orthogonal sum operation to combine evidence, which is rooted in calculating the joint probability of independent events [19].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">With two pieces of independent and fully reliable evidence represented by two bpas {a mathematical formula}m1 and {a mathematical formula}m2 respectively, for any proposition {a mathematical formula} Θ ⊆ Θ , Dempster ʼ s rule is given as follows [25]{a mathematical formula} where ⊕ is the orthogonal sum operator.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The term {a mathematical formula}m Θ ,i may also be referred to as basic probability mass or the degree of support for Θ from {a mathematical formula}ei.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Definition 3 generalises the bpa method of the ER approach as shown in Eq.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(14) to handle both local and global ignorance.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It is worth noting that multiplying {a mathematical formula}p Θ ,i by the same weight {a mathematical formula}wi for all {a mathematical formula} Θ ⊆ Θ does not change the relativity property of belief degree, or {a mathematical formula}mA,i/mB,i=pA,i/pB,i for any {a mathematical formula}A,B ⊆ Θ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As such, the specificity of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei is kept intact.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In Definition 3 the residual support ({a mathematical formula}1 − wi) of {a mathematical formula}ei is nominally attached to {a mathematical formula}P( Θ ) without being pre-assigned to any specific proposition of Θ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The residual support can thus be conjunctively redistributed to all propositions because {a mathematical formula} Θ ∩ P( Θ )= Θ for any {a mathematical formula} Θ ⊆ Θ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This can ensure genuine conjunctive reasoning in an evidence combination process.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Corollary 3</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">ER rule with weight and reliabilitySuppose two pieces of independent evidence{a mathematical formula}e1and{a mathematical formula}e2are each profiled by Eq.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">(20)and their WBDRs are represented by Eq.(38).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The combined degrees of belief to which{a mathematical formula}e1and{a mathematical formula}e2jointly support proposition Θ , denoted by{a mathematical formula}p Θ ,e(2), is given by Eq.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">(29)with{a mathematical formula}m ˆ Θ ,e(2)given by{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Corollary 4</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Recursive ER rule with weight and reliabilitySuppose L pieces of independent evidence are each profiled by Eq.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">(20)and their WBDRs are represented by Eq.(38).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Suppose{a mathematical formula}e(i)is defined in the same way as inCorollary 1.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The combined degree of belief to which L pieces of independent evidence{a mathematical formula}eiwith weight{a mathematical formula}wiand reliability{a mathematical formula}ri{a mathematical formula}(i=1, … ,L)jointly support proposition Θ is given by Eq.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">(34)with{a mathematical formula}m ˆ Θ ,e(L)generated by recursively applying Eq.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">(31)and the following two equations{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The results shown in Table 5 are straightforward to interpret as the ER rule constitutes a conjunctive probabilistic reasoning process.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">In fact, the bpas given in rows 2 – 4 of Table 5 do not change the specificity of any evidence at all.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">For example, the bpa for {a mathematical formula}e1, as shown in row 2 of Table 5, was generated for all {a mathematical formula} Θ ⊆ Θ by multiplying the belief degrees shown in row 2 of Table 3 by the same coefficient {a mathematical formula}crw,1w1=0.8182 with {a mathematical formula}r1=0.8, {a mathematical formula}w1=0.9 and {a mathematical formula}crw,1=1/(1+w1 − r1)=0.9091.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">In the rest of this subsection, we show that the ER rule satisfies all the above four synthesis axioms by proving the following four theorems.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Suppose there are L pieces of independent evidence described by BDs, as defined by Eq.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">(20).</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Let {a mathematical formula}wi and {a mathematical formula}ri be the weight and reliability of the ith piece of evidence which satisfies the following conditions{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Suppose each piece of evidence plays a limited role and the combination of the L pieces of evidence is generated by using the ER rule given by Theorem 2, Corollary 1, Corollary 2, or Corollary 3, Corollary 4.</a>
