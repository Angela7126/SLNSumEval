<a href="#0" id="0">We assume a linear model for the generation of true AOD values, corrupted by a stochastic process as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}w ∈ RD is a weight vector, and {a mathematical formula} Ε i is a regression error due to zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance {a mathematical formula} Σ 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Once Θ is learned, and given expert predictions {a mathematical formula}y ˆ i, aggregated prediction {a mathematical formula}yi for the ith data point can be found as a mean of the posterior distribution {a mathematical formula}yi|xi,y ˆ iK ∼ N(y ‾ i,(1T Σ − 11) − 1), where mean {a mathematical formula}y ‾ i is computed as{a mathematical formula} with {a mathematical formula}y ˆ i=[(y ˆ iK)T, Μ i]T, and Σ is a {a mathematical formula}(K+1)×(K+1) block matrix equal to{a mathematical formula} Interestingly, we can see that the prior mean {a mathematical formula} Μ i can be viewed as an additional expert with variance {a mathematical formula} Σ 2, which is independent from the original K experts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, to simplify the presentation, in the following we consider the prior mean as the {a mathematical formula}(K+1)th expert that is always available to the aggregation algorithm (i.e., it can never be missing).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the second set of experiments we evaluated the benefits of data partitioning using the EM algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We randomly sampled from each training site 50 labeled and 50 unlabeled data points, and from the left-out site sampled 50 labeled data points used for validation, assuming {a mathematical formula} Σ → ∞ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We used our proposed method with {a mathematical formula}R ∈ {1,2,3,4,5}, repeating the experiments 5 times.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">RMSE is reported in the middle of Table 2, where at the top we also report the RMSE of the semi-supervised method using the per-continent partition considered earlier.</a>
