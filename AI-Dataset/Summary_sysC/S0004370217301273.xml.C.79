<a href="#1" id="1">We say that l is strictly derived from X wrt K, denoted by {a mathematical formula}X ⊢ Kl, iff {a mathematical formula}l ∈ X or l is the conclusion of an argument constructed according to Definition 2 where in step 1 only elements from {a mathematical formula}Xdom are used and in step 2, only the strict rules from K are used.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Attack relationAn attack relation for a knowledge base K is a relation {a mathematical formula}att ⊆ ARK×ARK such that there is no attack against strict arguments, i.e.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">att is said to satisfy the consistency postulate iff for each complete extension E of {a mathematical formula}(ARK,att), the set {a mathematical formula}cnl(E) of conclusions of arguments in E is consistent.att is said to satisfy the closure postulate iff for each complete extension E of {a mathematical formula}(ARK,att), the set {a mathematical formula}cnl(E) of conclusions of arguments in E is closed.att is said to satisfy the subargument closure postulate iff for each complete extension E of {a mathematical formula}(ARK,att), E contains all subarguments of its arguments.For ease of reference, the above three postulates are often referred to as</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">How could we determine the attack relation for {a mathematical formula}K0?As both {a mathematical formula}A2,A3 belong to both {a mathematical formula}ARK, {a mathematical formula}ARK0 and the two knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K0,K have identical rule-based system, we expect that the attack relations between their common arguments should be identical.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Context-independenceWe say attack relation assignment atts for a rule-based system {a mathematical formula}R satisfies the property of context-independence iff for any two knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K,K ′ ∈ CR and for any two arguments A, B from {a mathematical formula}ARK ∩ ARK ′ , it holds that {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ atts(K) iff (A,B) ∈ atts(K ′ ).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore there exists no regular attack relation assignment for {a mathematical formula}CK.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The normal attack relation assignment{a mathematical formula}attsnr is defined by: For any knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ R and any arguments {a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ ARK, {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ attsnr(K) if and only if A undercuts B or A normal-rebuts B.</a>

<a href="#11" id="11">Hence from Lemma 7, it follows that all regular properties except the effective rebut one are satisfied.Since the set {a mathematical formula}{a,b} is inconsistent, there is no knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ CR such that {a mathematical formula}{a,b} ⊆ BEK.</a>

<a href="#13" id="13">An argument preference assignment (or ap-assignment for short) for a rule-based system {a mathematical formula}R is a function Γ assigning to each knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ CR, a relation {a mathematical formula} ⊑ Γ ,K ⊆ ARK×ARK (whose strict core is {a mathematical formula} ⊏ Γ ,K) representing a preference relation between arguments in {a mathematical formula}ARK where strict arguments are not strictly less preferred than any other arguments.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In [23], a natural property of irrelevance of redundant defaults stating that adding a defeasible rule of the form ⇒ f to a knowledge base K for any evidence {a mathematical formula}f ∈ BEK should not change its semantics is presented and shown that it is satisfied by attack relation assignments satisfying the properties of attack monotonicity and context-independence.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Further let {a mathematical formula}Xdom=X ∩ Ldom.We say that l is strictly derived from X wrt K, denoted by {a mathematical formula}X ⊢ Kl, iff {a mathematical formula}l ∈ X or l is the conclusion of an argument constructed using only elements from {a mathematical formula}Xdom and the strict rules from K.{sup:25}The closure of a set {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ L wrt knowledge base K, denoted by {a mathematical formula}CNK(X), is defined by {a mathematical formula}CNK(X)={l|X ⊢ Kl}.X is said to be closed wrt K iff {a mathematical formula}X=CNK(X).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For extended rule-based systems, we define normal attack relation assignments in the same way as before, namely, for any extended knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ ER and any arguments {a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ ARK, {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ attsenr(K) if and only if A undercuts or undermines B or A normal-rebuts B where the definition of normal-rebuts is the same like in section 5.2.</a>

<a href="#21" id="21">From Theorem 1, it follows immediately that {a mathematical formula}atts0 also satisfies the inconsistency-resolving property.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">It is obvious that {a mathematical formula}atts0 satisfies the effective rebut property if each attack relation assignment in {a mathematical formula}A satisfies this property.</a>
