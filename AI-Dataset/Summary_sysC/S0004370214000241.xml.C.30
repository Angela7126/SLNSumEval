<a href="#0" id="0">In order to implement anytime local search algorithms that follow the same synchronous structure of DSA and DBA for distributed optimization problems, the global result of every synchronous step must be calculated and the best solution must be stored.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A trivial approach would be to centralize in every step the costs calculated by all agents to a single agent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This agent would then inform the other agents each time a solution that improves the results on all previous solutions is obtained.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, this method has drawbacks both in the increase in the number of messages and in the violation of privacy caused from the need to inform a single agent (not necessarily a neighbor of all agents) of the quality of all other agents' states in each step of the algorithm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Both studies, [37] and [36], reported results on the number of messages sent between agents (triggered by assignment changes) because they considered an asynchronous version of DSA.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In our work, we consider synchronous local search algorithms that perform in an asynchronous environment; thus, agents must exchange messages with all neighbors in every step of the algorithm.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We use the term step for a synchronous iteration of a local search algorithm.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The state of an agent in each step includes its value assignment and the local cost, which is the sum of costs incurred according to constraints with the value assignments of its neighbors.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The global state in each step includes the full assignment and the costs of all constraints violated by the full assignment.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Assume agents 1, 3, and 5 selected a and agents 2 and 4 selected b.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the first step all agents can change their assignment without increasing local cost.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Following a stochastic decision only agents 2 and 5 replace their assignment.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Now agents 1, 2, and 3 hold a and agents 4 and 5 hold b.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">At this step only agent 4 can replace its assignment and if it does so, in the next step only agent 5 can replace its assignment.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In the resulting state, all agents assign a to their variable and the algorithm converges.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In standard local search algorithms (such as DSA and DBA), agents at each step send at least one message to each of their neighbors.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The standard use of local search algorithms for DisCSPs and DCOPs prior to the proposal of the ALS_DCOP framework includes running an algorithm for some number of steps (m) and reporting the complete assignment (solution) held by the agents after the mth step.</a>
