<a href="#2" id="2">The transition function {a mathematical formula} Γ D( Π ,s) with respect to a complete model {a mathematical formula}D ∈ 《 D ˜ 》 is defined recursively as follows:{a mathematical formula} In order to complete the definition of {a mathematical formula} Γ (s, Π ), it is necessary to define {a mathematical formula} Γ D( 〈 a 〉 ,s), the resulting state after applying action a in state s with respect to a complete model {a mathematical formula}D. Given that the domain model {a mathematical formula}D ˜ used during planning is incomplete, it is quite expected that some action of a synthesized plan might fail to be applied during execution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In our approximate transition function, the resulting state from applying action a in state s is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} The projection of an action sequence Π from a state s is defined as {a mathematical formula} Γ ˜ SE( Π ,s)=s if {a mathematical formula} Π = 〈 〉 , and {a mathematical formula} Γ ˜ SE( Π ,s)= Γ ˜ SE( 〈 a 〉 , Γ ˜ SE( Π ′ ,s)) if {a mathematical formula} Π = Π ′ ∘ 〈 a 〉 .</a>
