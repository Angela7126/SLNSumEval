<a href="#0" id="0">A bi-criterion clustering algorithm finding a complete and minimal set of Pareto solutions for different values of the number k of clusters is proposed in [5].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When {a mathematical formula}k=2, an exact polynomial algorithm is proposed in [12], [13].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no algorithm dealing with this bi-criterion, while supporting various kinds of user constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the split-diameter bi-criterion optimization without user constraints, an algorithm finding a complete and minimal set of Pareto optimal solutions, which are partitions with at most {a mathematical formula}kmax clusters, is proposed in [5].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Minimal split Δ : a Δ -constraint requires that the split between two clusters must be at least Δ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore for each couple {a mathematical formula}i<j ∈ [1,n] such that {a mathematical formula}d(i,j)< Δ , the constraint {a mathematical formula}Gi=Gj is put.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The constraint {a mathematical formula}S ≥ Δ is also put.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">When maximizing the minimal split between clusters, any two points at a distance less than the minimal split S must be in the same cluster:{a mathematical formula} Since S is a variable, these relations are also expressed by reified constraints.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since {a mathematical formula} Δ 1D is a partition that minimizes the diameter among all the partitions satisfying the user constraints {a mathematical formula}C (line 3), there exists no partition Δ satisfying {a mathematical formula}C with {a mathematical formula}D( Δ )<D( Δ 1D).</a>
