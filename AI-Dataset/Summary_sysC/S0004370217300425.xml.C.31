<a href="#0" id="0">For the thick case, we have a thick function {a mathematical formula}[f] from {a mathematical formula}Rn to {a mathematical formula}IRm and a thick set {a mathematical formula} 〚 Y 〛 ∈ IP(Rn).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We want to compute an approximation of the set of all sets {a mathematical formula}X=f − 1(Y), assuming that {a mathematical formula}f ∈ [f] and {a mathematical formula}Y ∈ 〚 Y 〛 .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This problem, formalized by Theorem 5, is called a thick set inversion problem, denoted by{a mathematical formula} We propose to compute an approximation of {a mathematical formula} 〚 X 〛 by decomposing {a mathematical formula}Rn into three subsets: the clear zone {a mathematical formula}X ⊂ , the penumbra {a mathematical formula}X ⊃ \X ⊂ and the dark zone {a mathematical formula}Rn\X ⊃ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In our approach, a paver performs the decomposition of {a mathematical formula}Rn into boxes and a thick extension of an inclusion function is used to classify boxes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As illustrated by Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">6, the thick box {a mathematical formula} 〚 f 〛 ([x]) encloses the set of all boxes {a mathematical formula}[f](a) with {a mathematical formula}a ∈ [x].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The vector {a mathematical formula}a ∈ [x] ⊂ R2 has an image {a mathematical formula}[f](a) which is a box of {a mathematical formula}R2 with a lower bound {a mathematical formula}f − (a) and an upper bound {a mathematical formula}f+(a).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Using a classical interval arithmetic, we are able to get inclusion functions {a mathematical formula}[f − ] and {a mathematical formula}[f+] for {a mathematical formula}f − and {a mathematical formula}f+.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The boxes {a mathematical formula}[f − ]([x]) and {a mathematical formula}[f+]([x]) contain {a mathematical formula}f − (a) and {a mathematical formula}f+(a).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore, the box {a mathematical formula}[f](a) is inside the thick box {a mathematical formula} 〚 f 〛 ([x])= 〚 [f − ]([x]),[f+]([x]) 〛 .</a>
