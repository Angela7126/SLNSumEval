<a href="#0" id="0">Although the agent {a mathematical formula} Α i cannot plan using {a mathematical formula} Π i ▷ , as the resulting plan might not be executable in the multi-agent problem {a mathematical formula}M, it can be used for heuristic computation (the projected problem is in fact an abstraction of {a mathematical formula}M).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The MADLA (Multi-Agent Distributed and Local Asynchronous) Planner proposed in this article is a sound and complete MA-STRIPS privacy-preserving multi-agent planner (Definition 7).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to find a solution (multi-agent plan) to a multi-agent planning problem {a mathematical formula}M the MADLA Planner employs a distributed search through the state space induced by the problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to find a plan, the MADLA Planner searches through a state-space (where states are {a mathematical formula}s ⊆ P) induced by the input multi-agent planning problem, driven by a pair of a projected (local) heuristic and a distributed (global) heuristic.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From the literature [6], [18], we know that the performance of local and distributed heuristics differ over various multi-agent planning problems.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The novel search scheme we are proposing combines the local and distributed heuristics in a manner inspired by the classical multi-heuristic search [10], but modified to be suitable for similar (or as in our case the same) heuristics which differ only in that one is computed on the projected problem and the other one on the global problem using a distributed algorithm.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The main principle of multi-agent heuristic search is that all agents explore their portions of the search space asynchronously and in parallel, each agent using only its actions from {a mathematical formula}Ai.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The MADLA Search uses two heuristics for each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i, a local projected {a mathematical formula}hLi and a distributed {a mathematical formula}hDi.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The search uses an open list for each of the heuristics {a mathematical formula}OLi,ODi for each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The open list selection function prioritizes expansion of states in the open list {a mathematical formula}ODi respective to the distributed heuristic {a mathematical formula}hDi, if the heuristic estimator of {a mathematical formula}hDi is not in the process of computing an heuristic estimate (i.e.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The local heuristic is the classical FF applied to each agent's projected problem {a mathematical formula} Π i ▷ , whereas the distributed variant is a novel privacy-preserving modification of previously published distributed FF [8], [6].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In the MADLA Planner, the FF heuristic is used as the local heuristic {a mathematical formula}hLi.</a>
