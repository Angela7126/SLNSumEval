<a href="#0" id="0">As for the case where {a mathematical formula}Rauc=Rbidder=X ⁎ , a Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium of this form requires some off-path beliefs that would result in optimal bids that are undesirable for the auctioneer, hence pushing her to full disclosure of values.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A possible solution in this case is to use the off-path bidder beliefs that, with probability 1, the reached node is the one encoding the history in which the auctioneer purchased the information and found the common value to be {a mathematical formula}xmin=argminx{uauc(X=x)}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is, all bidders think that, with probability 1, the undisclosed value is the one that minimizes the auctioneer's expected benefit upon disclosure.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A bidder with type t should then bid {a mathematical formula}Vt(xmin).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Such off-path actions would not result in {a mathematical formula}Rauc=Rbidder=X ⁎ always being a Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, as it does not guarantee that the auctioneer has no incentive to deviate to a strategy {a mathematical formula}Rauc= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Still, later on we prove that if there is no stable solution of the form {a mathematical formula}(R ′ ,R ′ ), where {a mathematical formula}R ′ ≠ X ⁎ , then {a mathematical formula}(X ⁎ ,X ⁎ ) with the above off-path bidder beliefs is necessarily a Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The analysis of the case where bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information is an instance of the case where the auctioneer needs to calculate her expected-benefit-maximizing strategy given the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, as given in Section 3.2, for {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this case, the auctioneer will simply choose the subset {a mathematical formula}Rauc associated with the maximum value according to the first column in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since all elements in the first column, except for {a mathematical formula}( ∅ , ∅ ), decrease equally due to the increase in the value C, the auctioneer will keep on using this strategy for any setting with greater C values until her expected benefit is less than {a mathematical formula}u( ∅ , ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this section we extend the equilibrium analysis to the case of using mixed strategies.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The nature of the mixed-strategy perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium in our model is necessarily such that while the auctioneer randomizes between the different pure strategies the bidders keep using a pure strategy.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This is due to the fact that if the auctioneer discloses the value x of X then the dominating strategy for each bidder is to bid her expected private value, as before, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} Similarly, when a value is not disclosed, the dominating strategy for the bidders is to bid their expected individual private value, based on their belief of the strategy used by the auctioneer (and consequently the probability they assign to each value {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X when information is not disclosed).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Therefore, an auctioneer's strategy can be represented as {a mathematical formula}Rauc=(p,p1,...,pk), where p is the probability that the information indeed will be purchased and {a mathematical formula}pi{a mathematical formula}(1 ≤ i ≤ k) is the probability that the value {a mathematical formula}xi will be disclosed if indeed the information is purchased and this value turns out to be the true common value.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">It is notable that the cost threshold whereby the auctioneer no longer purchases the information in equilibrium increases as the number of bidders increases.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The intuitive explanation for this phenomenon is as follows: the benefit of disclosing the information is in having the bidders bid their true private value.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">When the number of bidders is relatively small, however, even if a bidder of the type that most values the auctioned item bids its true value, based on the disclosed common value, it is possible that the second-best bid will be relatively low and consequently the auctioneer will not benefit enough from revealing the information.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As the number of agents increases, it is more probable that at least two agents of types that assign a relatively high private value to the disclosed common value will take part in the auction, and therefore the cost that the auctioneer will be willing to pay for the information will increase.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Overall, we observe that the increase in the number of bidders results in an increase in the auctioneer's expected benefit and a decrease in the bidders' expected benefit (for any number of agents {a mathematical formula}n1>n2 and cost C for which the same decision of whether or not to purchase the information is made).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">This is explained, once again, by the effect of the increase in the number of bidders on the probability that at least two agents of types that assign a relatively high private value to the disclosed common value will take part in the auction.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">A similar effect is observed with the expected social welfare, as this measure represents the efficiency of the item's allocation – the more bidders available in the auction, the greater the winner's valuation of the item is likely to be.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Fig.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">6 offers a similar analysis, emphasizing the effect of the level of heterogeneity between the bidders in the environment over the expected benefit of the different players in equilibrium.</a>
