<a href="#0" id="0">More generally, note that we can always partition the set of variables V in two sets {a mathematical formula}V ′ and {a mathematical formula}V ∖ V ′ such that {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ V ′ is a network over {a mathematical formula}{EC,TPP,TPP − 1}, {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ (V ∖ V ′ ) is a network over {a mathematical formula}{TPP,TPP − 1,NTPP,NTPP − 1} and {a mathematical formula}viPPvj for any {a mathematical formula}vi ∈ V ′ and {a mathematical formula}vj ∈ V ∖ V ′ (see the following proof of Proposition 10).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is then straightforward to find a convex solution of {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ V ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As we show in the proof of Proposition 10, this solution of {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ V ′ can always be extended to a solution of Θ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">There exists a consistent atomic RCC8 network over{a mathematical formula}{EC,DC}which has no convex solution in{a mathematical formula}R2.Consider the consistent atomic RCC8 network Θ containing the following constraints:{a mathematical formula} as well as the constraint xDCy for every pair of variables {a mathematical formula}(x,y) from {a mathematical formula}{a,b,c,u,v,w} which does not appear in the list above.Assuming that a convex solution {a mathematical formula}S of Θ in the plane exists, we can draw {a mathematical formula}K3,3 as follows.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For every{a mathematical formula}n ≥ 1there exists a consistent atomic RCC5 network Θ over{a mathematical formula}{DR,PO,PP,PP − 1}which has no convex solution in{a mathematical formula}Rn.Let {a mathematical formula}n ≥ 1 be arbitrary and consider the following set of RCC5 constraints Θ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ (V ∖ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})) is a network over {a mathematical formula}{PO,TPP,TPP − 1}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that {a mathematical formula}V ∖ (W ∪ U ∪ {z}) contains an even number of elements.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If {a mathematical formula}|V ∖ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})| ≥ 6 we start with a 2-dimensional convex solution of {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ (V ∖ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})), whose existence is guaranteed by Corollary 3.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This solution is then extended to a {a mathematical formula}k+2 dimensional weak convex solution of {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ (V ∖ (W ∪ {z})), by repeatedly applying the method from Proposition 20, and then extended to a {a mathematical formula}k+3 dimensional convex solution of {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ (V ∖ W) by applying the method from Lemma 9.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, by repeatedly applying the method from Proposition 20, we obtain a {a mathematical formula}k+l+3 dimensional convex solution of Θ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Note that {a mathematical formula}2n+1=|W ∪ U ∪ {z}|+|V ∖ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})|=2k+2l+1+|V ∖ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})| ≥ 2k+2l+7, from which we obtain {a mathematical formula}k+l+3 ≤ n.If {a mathematical formula}|V ∖ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})|=4, we know by Corollary 17 that {a mathematical formula} Θ ↓ (V ∖ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})) has a convex weak solution in {a mathematical formula}R. By applying Proposition 20 and Lemma 9, as before, we can extend this weak solution to a convex solution of Θ in {a mathematical formula}Rk+l+2, with {a mathematical formula}k+l+2 ≤ n.Suppose {a mathematical formula}|V ∖ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})|=2, and write {a mathematical formula}V ∖ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})={x,y}.</a>
