<a href="#0" id="0">However, one can assert some of the properties of continuous change; for instance, an object with a continuously changing shape cannot go from inside to outside a container without overlapping the container.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore we include the concept of a “ continuous history ” in the qualitative level even though we do not fully define it.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We do not need comparable physical axioms for closed containers; the fact that an object necessarily remains in a closed container is a consequence of the general physical laws, that objects move continuously and do not overlap, together with spatio-temporal theorems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The predicates Fits(s,r) means that object set s fits into region r. (This is a purely geometric relation, meaning that there is a configuration of s that lies inside r; it does not require that it is physically possible to move the objects in s into that configuration.)</a>
