<a href="#0" id="0">Roth's theorem [20], one of the main results in the area, states that for the hypergraph formed by the arithmetic progressions in {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,n}, that is {a mathematical formula}Hn=(Un,Sn), where {a mathematical formula}Un={1,2, … ,n} and elements of {a mathematical formula}Sn being of the form {a mathematical formula}(d ⋅ i+c) for arbitrary {a mathematical formula}d,c, the discrepancy grows at least as {a mathematical formula}120n1/4.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Surprisingly, for the more restricted case of homogeneous arithmetic progressions of the form {a mathematical formula}(d ⋅ i), the question of the discrepancy bounds has been open for more than eighty years.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By considering cases, one can see that any ±1 sequence containing 12 or more elements has discrepancy at least 2; that is, Erd Ő s's conjecture holds for the particular case {a mathematical formula}C=1 (also implied by a stronger result of Mathias [27]).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We prove the surprising result that {a mathematical formula}127645, the length of the longest completely multiplicative sequence of discrepancy 3, is also the maximal length of a multiplicative sequence of discrepancy 3, which is not the case for {a mathematical formula}C=1 and {a mathematical formula}C=2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It can be checked in a similar way that the other possibility of {a mathematical formula}x1 being − 1 also leads to a contradiction.The first eleven elements of the sequence (3) form a discrepancy 1 sequence.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Reasoning similar to the one above shows that there exists a unique longest completely multiplicative ±1 sequence of discrepancy 1 which has nine elements:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then{a mathematical formula} Thus {a mathematical formula}a1, … ,al is C-bounded if, and only if,{a mathematical formula} which is equivalent to the two following systems of inequalities,{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} If we interpret now the numerical values 0 and 1 as Boolean constants true and false, respectively, the 0/1 sequence {a mathematical formula}a1, … ,al corresponds to the evaluation of a sequence of Boolean propositions {a mathematical formula}p1, … ,pl under some interpretation I, and C-boundedness of a sequence can be expressed as cardinality constraints in a natural way.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, under the conditions of the proposition, {a mathematical formula}| ∑ i=1jai| ≤ C − 1, and the sequence can be extended arbitrarily.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally notice that the fact that {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn is multiplicative does not imply that {a mathematical formula} − x1, … , − xn is, so symmetry breaking described in Proposition 11 is not applicable for multiplicative and completely multiplicative sequences.</a>
