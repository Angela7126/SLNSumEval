<a href="#0" id="0">[8] explores the axiomatic properties of this notion of rational closure for {a mathematical formula}ALC, and shows that the notion of default assumption consequence is a rational consequence relation validating the knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Furthermore, we investigate its semantics, by extending to {a mathematical formula}ALC the minimal model semantics introduced at the propositional level in order to address question A.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Before presenting the axiomatization of R, let us clarify one point: in its original presentation [33], a conditional {a mathematical formula}A| ∼ B is considered as a consequence relation between a pair of propositional formulas A and B, so that their systems provide a set of “ postulates ” (or closure conditions) that the intended consequence relation must satisfy.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">if, for all rational models {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 W,<,V 〉 , it holds that {a mathematical formula}M ⊨ F.Given a set of formulas K of {a mathematical formula}L and a model {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 W,<,V 〉 , we say that {a mathematical formula}M is a model of K, written {a mathematical formula}M ⊨ K, if for every {a mathematical formula}F ∈ K and every {a mathematical formula}w ∈ W, we have that {a mathematical formula}M,w ⊨ F.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">K rationally entails a formula F, written {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ F if F is valid in all rational models of K.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We begin by proving a property that links the rank {a mathematical formula}kM of a formula in any rational model {a mathematical formula}M of a given knowledge base K and the rank of that formula as calculated in the definition of rational closure (Definition 5).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">VIMSGiven models {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 W,<,V 〉 and {a mathematical formula}M ′ = 〈 W ′ ,< ′ ,V ′ 〉 we say that {a mathematical formula}M is preferred to {a mathematical formula}M ′ with respect to the variable interpretations minimal semantics, and write {a mathematical formula}M<VIMSM ′ , if</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Canonical models are defined with respect to the language {a mathematical formula}L restricted to the propositional variables occurring in the knowledge base and in the query.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given a knowledge base K and a query Q, let {a mathematical formula}ATMK,Q be the set of all the propositional variables of ATM occurring in K or in the query Q, and let {a mathematical formula}LK,Q be the restriction of the language {a mathematical formula}L to the propositional variables in {a mathematical formula}ATMK,Q.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It can be easily shown that, for any knowledge base, a minimal canonical FIMS model exists: this is any canonical model in which every possible world w has the rank associated to the conjunction of all atoms and negated atoms in {a mathematical formula}LK,Q that it satisfies.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula}M ′ = 〈 W ′ ,< ′ ,V ′ 〉 be a model of {a mathematical formula}K ″ minimal with respect to {a mathematical formula}<VIMS that does not satisfy {a mathematical formula}A| ∼ B, i.e., such that {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (A ∧ ¬B) ≤ kM ′ (A ∧ B).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We want to show that also {a mathematical formula}M ⊭ A| ∼ B, i.e., {a mathematical formula}kM(A ∧ ¬B) ≤ kM(A ∧ B).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For a contradiction, suppose in the canonical {a mathematical formula}M, {a mathematical formula}kM(A ∧ ¬B)=j>kM(A ∧ B)=i.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">By Proposition 2, Proposition 8, {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (A ∧ ¬B) ≥ j and {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (A ∧ B) ≥ i, and since by hypothesis {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (A ∧ ¬B) ≤ kM ′ (A ∧ B), it follows that {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (A ∧ B) ≥ j>i.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A model {a mathematical formula}M for a finite knowledge base K has the form {a mathematical formula}M=({true,false}ATM,kM) where {a mathematical formula}{true,false}ATM is the set of propositional interpretations for, say, a fixed finite propositional language, and {a mathematical formula}kM is our height function mapping propositional interpretations to {a mathematical formula}N, the definition of height {a mathematical formula}kM(A) of a formula is the same as in our semantic.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Our starting point is therefore the extension of logic {a mathematical formula}ALC with a typicality operator T: we allow concepts of the form {a mathematical formula}T(C), whose intuitive meaning is that {a mathematical formula}T(C) selects the typical instances of a concept C. We can therefore distinguish between the properties that hold for all instances of concept C ({a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D), and those that only hold for the typical such instances ({a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The semantics of {a mathematical formula}ALC+TR can be formulated in terms of rational models: ordinary models of {a mathematical formula}ALC are equipped with a preference relation < on the domain, whose intuitive meaning is to compare the “ typicality ” of domain elements, that is to say {a mathematical formula}x<y means that x is more typical than y.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Model satisfying a knowledge baseGiven an {a mathematical formula}ALC+TR model {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 Δ ,<,I 〉 , we assume that I is extended to assign a domain element {a mathematical formula}aI of Δ to each individual constant a of {a mathematical formula}O.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">It is worth noticing that, as a difference with our previous approach in [23], here we do not assume the unique name assumption, that is to say we do not assume that, in a model {a mathematical formula}M, I is extended to assign a distinct element {a mathematical formula}aI of Δ to each individual constant a of {a mathematical formula}O.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">As for propositional rational models, finite {a mathematical formula}ALC+TR models (to which we can restrict attention by Theorem 6) can be equivalently defined by postulating the existence of a function {a mathematical formula}kM: Δ ⟼ N, where {a mathematical formula}kM assigns a finite rank to each world, and is defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">As for the propositional case, the rank function {a mathematical formula}kM and < can be defined from each other by letting {a mathematical formula}x<y if and only if {a mathematical formula}kM(x)<kM(y).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">We take {a mathematical formula}(TBoxn,ABoxn) as the last element of the sequence of knowledge bases starting from K. Observe also that the definition of the {a mathematical formula}TBoxi's is the same as the definition of the {a mathematical formula}Ci's in Lehmann and Magidor's definition of rational closure in Section 2.2, except for the fact that here, at each step, we also add all the “ strict ” inclusions {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D (where T does not occur in C).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">As we will see in Theorem 7, in {a mathematical formula}ALC the existence of a canonical model is guaranteed for any consistent knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Let {a mathematical formula}Mi= 〈 Δ i,<i,Ii 〉 be the model, considered few lines above in this proof, such that {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Δ i is an instance of C. Starting from a finite model {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 Δ ,<,I 〉 of K ({a mathematical formula}M exists by the finite model property, Theorem 6), we add to {a mathematical formula}M all the domain elements of {a mathematical formula}Mi.We define the resulting model {a mathematical formula}M ′ = 〈 Δ ′ ,< ′ ,I ′ 〉 as follows: {a mathematical formula} Δ ′ = Δ ∪ Δ i; {a mathematical formula}I ′ is defined on the elements of Δ as I in {a mathematical formula}M, and on the elements of {a mathematical formula} Δ i as {a mathematical formula}Ii in {a mathematical formula}Mi.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">By point (1), if {a mathematical formula}rank(C)=i there is a {a mathematical formula}{C1,C2, … ,Cr} ⊆ S maximal and consistent with K containing C and such that {a mathematical formula}rank(C1 ⊓ C2 ⊓ … ⊓ Cr)=i.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">By Definition 24, we know that in all canonical models there is at least an instance of {a mathematical formula}(C1 ⊓ C2 ⊓ … ⊓ Cr).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">To prove point (2) we show that in all minimal canonical models {a mathematical formula}M of K, {a mathematical formula}kM(C1 ⊓ C2 ⊓ … ⊓ Cr)=i, which entails {a mathematical formula}kM(C)=i (since {a mathematical formula}C ∈ {C1,C2, … ,Cr}).</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">By Proposition 12 we know that {a mathematical formula}kM(C1 ⊓ C2 ⊓ … ⊓ Cr) ≥ i.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">We need to show that also {a mathematical formula}kM(C1 ⊓ C2 ⊓ … ⊓ Cr) ≤ i.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">For a contradiction suppose {a mathematical formula}kM(C1 ⊓ C2 ⊓ … ⊓ Cr)>i, i.e., for all the domain elements x instances of {a mathematical formula}C1 ⊓ C2 ⊓ … ⊓ Cr, {a mathematical formula}kM(x)>i.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Let {a mathematical formula}{C1, … ,Cr} be the maximal consistent set of concepts of which z is an instance in {a mathematical formula}M. We prove that, {a mathematical formula}rank(C1 ⊓ … ⊓ Cr)=rank(B).Clearly {a mathematical formula}rank(C1 ⊓ … Cr) ≥ rank(B) (since {a mathematical formula}B ∈ {C1, … ,Cr}).</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Suppose for a contradiction that {a mathematical formula}rank(C1 ⊓ … ⊓ Cr)>rank(B), i.e.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Hence, {a mathematical formula}K ⊭ ALC+TRC ⊓ ¬D ⊑ ⊥ , and the set of concepts {a mathematical formula}{C,¬D} is consistent with K. As {a mathematical formula}M is a canonical model of K, there must be an element {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Δ such that {a mathematical formula}x ∈ (C ⊓ ¬D)I.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">For a strict inclusion {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D the problem of deciding whether {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D ∈ TBox¯ is clearly in ExpTime as, by definition of {a mathematical formula}TBox¯ (Definition 22), it amounts to check whether {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ ALC+TRC ⊑ D (Theorem 5).</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">The problem of deciding whether {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D ∈ TBox¯ is in ExpTime as well.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">So we further refine Definition 25 by taking into account the interpretation of individual constants of the ABox: given two minimal canonical models {a mathematical formula}M and {a mathematical formula}M ′ , we will prefer {a mathematical formula}M to {a mathematical formula}M ′ if there is an individual constant b occurring in ABox such that {a mathematical formula}kM(bI)<kM(bI ′ ) (whereas {a mathematical formula}kM(aI) ≤ kM(aI ′ ) for all other individual constants occurring in ABox).</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">More formally, in order to calculate the rational closure of ABox, written {a mathematical formula}ABox¯, for all individual constants of the ABox we find which is the lowest possible rank they can have in minimal canonical models with respect to Definition 25: the idea is that an individual constant {a mathematical formula}ai can have a given rank {a mathematical formula}kj(ai) just in case it is compatible with all the inclusions of the TBox that do not contain the T operator or that have a {a mathematical formula}T(C) on the left side with C's rank {a mathematical formula} ≥ kj(ai) (the inclusions whose antecedent C's rank is {a mathematical formula}<kj(ai) do not matter since, in the minimal canonical model, there will be an instance of C with rank {a mathematical formula}<kj(ai) and therefore {a mathematical formula}ai will not be a typical instance of C).</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">I then extends to boolean combinations of concepts in the usual way.In order to conclude the model's construction, for each role R, we define {a mathematical formula}RI as follows.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">(iv) To define the rational closure {a mathematical formula}ABox¯ of ABox, for each concept C occurring in K or in the query (there are {a mathematical formula}O(|K|) many concepts), and for each named individual {a mathematical formula}ai, we have to check if {a mathematical formula}C(ai) is derivable in {a mathematical formula}ALC+TR from {a mathematical formula}TBox ∪ ABox ∪ Μ j for all minimal consistent rank assignments {a mathematical formula}kj.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">An alternative semantic characterization of T can be given by means of a set of postulates that are essentially a reformulation of axioms and rules of nonmonotonic entailment in rational logic R: in this respect, the T-assertion {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D is equivalent to the conditional assertion {a mathematical formula}C| ∼ D in {a mathematical formula}R.{sup:5} Given a domain Δ and a valuation function I, one can define the function {a mathematical formula}fT(S) for {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ Δ that selects the typical instances of S, and in case {a mathematical formula}S=CI for a concept C, it selects the typical instances of C. In this semantics, we define {a mathematical formula}(T(C))I=fT(CI), and {a mathematical formula}fT has the intuitive properties for all subsets S of Δ of Definition 28 below:</a>
