<a href="#0" id="0">Section 4 develops query complexity results for certain forms of monotone predicates; it is shown that minimal sets for these predicates can be computed with a logarithmic number of calls to an NP oracle that provides a witness (the class {a mathematical formula}FPNP[wit,log]).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Relation to {a mathematical formula}FNP//OptP[log]Literature introduces the class {a mathematical formula}FNP//OptP[log], which is characterized by a polynomial nondeterministic Turing machine that is given advice in the form of an optimum for certain function [10].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">So for instance, MaxSAT could be computed in this class similarly as in proof of Proposition 1, i.e.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Lemma 4 together with the fact that {a mathematical formula}MaxSet ∈ FPNP[wit,log] enables constructing a minimal set for predicates of form {a mathematical formula}P whenever the minimal set is unique.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Lemma 4 enables us to determine whether an arbitrary element {a mathematical formula}u ∈ R belongs to {a mathematical formula}M or not.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence, we construct {a mathematical formula}M by testing {a mathematical formula}P(R ∖ {u}) for each {a mathematical formula}u ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This gives rise to {a mathematical formula}|R| tests of P. For a set {a mathematical formula}W, from definition of {a mathematical formula}P (Definition 9), it holds that {a mathematical formula}P(W)=1 iff the formula {a mathematical formula}G ∧ ⋀ u ∈ W Σ (u) is satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Hence, each of the tests {a mathematical formula}P(R ∖ {u}) translates to a SAT test.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This section extends the results of Section 4 to the case when it is known that there are exactly k minimal sets, for some constant k. Given the results of previous sections, form {a mathematical formula}P is the only predicate form of interest, since function problems represented with predicates of either form {a mathematical formula}L or {a mathematical formula}B can be solved with a logarithmic number of witness oracle calls (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Proposition 7 lets us derive that a minimal set for a predicate of the form {a mathematical formula}P can be computed if the number of minimal set is bounded.</a>
