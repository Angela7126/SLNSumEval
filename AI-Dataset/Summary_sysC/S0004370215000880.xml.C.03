<a href="#0" id="0">An assignment is proportional if each agent gets at least {a mathematical formula}1/n-th of the utility he would get if he got all the objects:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have already shown that weak SD proportionality implies possible envy-freeness for {a mathematical formula}n=2, and that possible envy-freeness implies weak SD envy-freeness.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}Clearly p, the assignment specified in Table 3 is weak SD envy-free.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this case, in each discrete assignment p, there exists some agent {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N who gets less than {a mathematical formula}m/n objects.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}m=nand it is possible to allocate to each agent an object that is not his least preferred object;{a mathematical formula}m>n.Moreover, it can be checked in polynomial time whether a weak SD proportional discrete assignment exists when agents have strict preferences.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then there exists no weak SD proportional discrete assignment because some agent will get fewer than {a mathematical formula}m/n objects.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A weak SD proportional discrete assignment exists if and only if a feasible b-matching exists for the graph corresponding to at least one of the {a mathematical formula} ∏ i=1n(ki+1) combinations of conditions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consider the following assignment problem:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The discrete assignment that gives {a mathematical formula}{b,c,f} to agent 1 and {a mathematical formula}{d,e,a} to agent 2 is SD proportional.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let {a mathematical formula}(N,O, ≿ ) be an assignment problem and p be a discrete assignment.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let {a mathematical formula}(N,O, ≿ ) be an assignment problem and p be a discrete assignment.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We say that an assignment satisfies {a mathematical formula}1/ Α proportionality if{a mathematical formula} We note that {a mathematical formula}1/n proportionality is equivalent to SD proportionality.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Since m is not a multiple of n, an SD proportional assignment does not exist.</a>
