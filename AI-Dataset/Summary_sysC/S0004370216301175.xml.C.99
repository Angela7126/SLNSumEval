<a href="#0" id="0">Then, to determine which alternatives will be selected from a choice experiment B it is necessary to consider all the decision rules from Γ that are applicable with respect to the justified conclusions that can be inferred from the active arguments of {a mathematical formula}K. The set of acceptable alternatives can be defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By hypothesis, alternatives x and y have the same attributes, therefore a fact {a mathematical formula}same_att(x,y) will belong to evidence set E (Definition 5).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, by the definition of working set W (Definition 5) two primitive structures Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ exist such that set of arguments in Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ are respectively {a mathematical formula}args( Σ ) ={{a mathematical formula}A}, {a mathematical formula}args( Σ ′ ) ={{a mathematical formula}A{a mathematical formula}} ′ ,{sup:2} with the corresponding interfaces{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} and which are active with respect to E. Moreover, two active dialectical trees, {a mathematical formula}TK( Σ ) and {a mathematical formula}TK({a mathematical formula} Σ ′ ), will be built each one consisting of only one argumentation line {a mathematical formula} Λ =[ Σ ] and {a mathematical formula} Λ ′ =[ Σ ′ ], respectively, such that it trivially holds that {a mathematical formula}me( Σ , Λ ,TK( Σ ))=U and {a mathematical formula}me( Σ ′ , Λ ′ ,TK( Σ ′ ))=U.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From Definition 5, the evidence set E will contain all the facts of the kind {a mathematical formula}c(x,y) relating alternatives x and y (that belong to the choice experiment posed to the decision maker) with respect to all the preference criteria referred by the distinguished literals in {a mathematical formula}C. In this way, by Proposition 2 and Corollary 1 it will always be possible to activate a primitive argumental structure Σ , warranted in {a mathematical formula}K, such that {a mathematical formula}cl( Σ )=Z with {a mathematical formula}Z ∈ {better(x,y),better(y,x),¬better(x,y),¬better(y,x)}, thus stating a strong preference ( ≻ ) in favor of one of the alternatives.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Conversely, if alternatives x and y have the same attributes, by Proposition 3, conclusions {a mathematical formula}¬better(x,y) and {a mathematical formula}¬better(y,x) will be warranted by two active primitive argumental structures, which are warranted in {a mathematical formula}K, thus stating the indifference ( ∼ ) on the preference between the alternatives.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, the completeness property is satisfied.In order to check transitivity property, we must prove that for all {a mathematical formula}x,y,z ∈ X, if {a mathematical formula}x ≿ y and {a mathematical formula}y ≿ z, then {a mathematical formula}x ≿ z.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To introduce next result, Algorithm 1 will be considered as the function {a mathematical formula} Μ ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) with two arguments: an abstract decision framework and a set of alternatives.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Independently of whether X or {a mathematical formula}Xf is used, a key issue of the decision framework proposed in our work, is that its choice behavior has been formalized with respect to the general theory of choice of Classical Decision Theory and [34] has not.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In our case this is attained by defining the epistemic component of the decision framework as a DAF with particular features on the evidence set (i.e., the working set), the conflict relation, and preference function (see Definition 5 for details), and in [25] this is accomplished by defining ABA frameworks with different properties so that admissible arguments in those frameworks correspond to strongly dominant, dominant, or weakly dominant decisions in the corresponding mapped decision frameworks, in this way, the decisions made exhibit an element of consistency with respect to the accepted arguments in ABA.</a>
