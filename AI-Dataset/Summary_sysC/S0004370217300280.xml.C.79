<a href="#0" id="0">To make the comparisons systematic, and also for computational reasons, we consider what we call permissible translations of our causal action theories to logic programs under the answer set semantics [12], [13].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Specifically, given a set of properties on the transition models, we consider all possible permissible translations from our causal theories to logic programs so that the answer sets of these programs, when mapped back to the transition models of the causal theories, will satisfy all properties in the set.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As we mentioned, there has been much work on using logic programs for reasoning about action, and one of the key ideas has been to use the following rules to encode inertia:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Also we want the mapping to at least satisfy Property 1 so that both initial and successor states satisfy the static causal rules as constraints, and that a causal rule {a mathematical formula}(l,G) should be translated to some logic program rules about l. Besides, we want the mapping to be uniform in the sense that the fluent names are not material.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Notice that a mapping Ξ from causal action theories to logic programs yields a semantic function Δ under (1) and (2): {a mathematical formula}(s,s ′ ) ∈ Δ (T) iff there is an answer set A of {a mathematical formula} Ξ (T) such that (1) and (2) hold.</a>
