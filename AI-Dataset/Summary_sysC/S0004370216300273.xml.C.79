<a href="#0" id="0">Otherwise, we reach a consistent state, in which no further inference from module {a mathematical formula}S1 is applicable (that state represents a model of {a mathematical formula}S1).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proof that X is also a model of {a mathematical formula}BC( Π ) uses the well-known fact that if X is an answer set of Π , X is also a supported model of Π that is, for every {a mathematical formula}a ∈ X, there is {a mathematical formula}B ∈ Bodies( Π ) such that X is a model of {a mathematical formula}s(B).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let us consider an inference {a mathematical formula}(M,l) ∈ BC( Π ) such that M is consistent with X.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By the definition of {a mathematical formula}BC( Π ), there is a rule {a mathematical formula}a ← B in Π such that {a mathematical formula}a ∈ M, {a mathematical formula}l ∈ s(B), and for every {a mathematical formula}B ′ ∈ Bodies( Π ,a) such that {a mathematical formula}s(B ′ ) ≠ s(B), there is {a mathematical formula}u ∈ s(B ′ ) such that {a mathematical formula}u ‾ ∈ M.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}a ← B ′ be a rule in Π such that {a mathematical formula}s(B ′ ) ≠ s(B) and let {a mathematical formula}u ∈ s(B ′ ) be such that {a mathematical formula}u ‾ ∈ M.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since M is consistent with X, X is not a model of u (if {a mathematical formula}u=b, for some atom b, {a mathematical formula}¬b ∈ M and so, {a mathematical formula}b ∉ X; if {a mathematical formula}u=¬b, for some atom b, {a mathematical formula}b ∈ M and so, {a mathematical formula}b ∈ X).</a>
