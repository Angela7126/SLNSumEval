<a href="#0" id="0">By modelling appliances as hidden Markov models (HMMs), we learn a general appliance behavioural model which will generalise to previously unseen households.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We then use an unsupervised method by which these general appliance models can be tuned to the specific appliance instances in a previously unseen household using only aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We provide a method by which the general appliance models can be tuned to the appliances within a specific household using only aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In Section 2 we describe how appliance models can be learned from reference data sets that will generalise to previously unseen households.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Section 3 we describe how these general models can be tuned to specific appliance instances using only aggregate data from the test house.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We now describe our method for learning general appliance models which will generalise to previously unseen appliances of the same type.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">First, we propose a hierarchical approach to model multiple appliance instances of the same type.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the following section, we describe how these parameters are combined to form a model of the appliance type which will generalise to previously unseen instances of this appliance type.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We now describe a method by which the parameters learned in Section 2.1 can be combined to form a model that represents the whole appliance type, and therefore generalises to previously unseen instances of that appliance type.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We introduce the notation:{a mathematical formula} to represent the parameters of the general model of an appliance type as defined in the following paragraphs.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We use the approach described in this section to build models of an appliance type that will generalise to previously unseen instances of that appliance type.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The first benchmark uses training data from a single appliance instance from the training set (NT).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This indicates that the majority of the appliance type's behaviour can be described by a general model learned from a relatively small number of appliance instances.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Therefore, in this section we propose a method for learning such behaviour that is unique to a single household, which uses both general appliance models and household aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">More formally, this tuning process directly corresponds to learning the parameters {a mathematical formula} Θ (n) for an appliance instance n in a household, given the appliance type's general model Θ and the household's aggregate data x.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We then describe how these periods can be used to tune a general appliance model to the specific appliance within a given household (Section 3.2).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We calculate the likelihood that a period of aggregate data was generated by a single appliance instance drawn from a given general appliance model as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}x¯i:j is a window of aggregate data after the base-load has been subtracted, {a mathematical formula}p(x¯i:j| Θ ) is the likelihood of that window of data given the general appliance model Θ as in Eq.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Therefore, this process effectively identifies windows of aggregate data during which only an appliance matching its general model changes state.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">It is worth noting that the data likelihood {a mathematical formula}p(x¯i:j| Θ ) is inherently dependent upon the variance within an appliance type, since it decreases as the variance of the general appliance model increases.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Therefore, this period can be extracted from the aggregate load and used as an appliance signature with which the general model of refrigerator can be tuned.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Once the signatures of a single appliance instance have been extracted from aggregate data, the aim is to tune the general model to include the behaviour of the appliance instance which is unique to the previously unseen household.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Given that both the general model for this appliance type, Θ , and signatures sampled from the specific appliance instance are available, {a mathematical formula}x¯i:j, Bayesian integration [15] provides a natural approach to infer the posterior distribution over such appliance instance parameters with the state sequence marginalised out:{a mathematical formula} Therefore, we update the general model again using variational message passing as described in Appendix A.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">However, it should be noted that the mean power of the on state, {a mathematical formula} Μ k, is just one of the set of appliance model parameters, Θ , and therefore it is not expected that appliances will be uniquely distinguishable using only this parameter.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We evaluated the benefit of tuning general appliance models using the Reference Energy Disaggregation Data set (REDD) [23].</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The first (GT) uses the general appliance model as learned empirically in Section 2 without any model tuning.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">This variant represents the model fit of the general appliance models.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Furthermore, it can be seen that for 3 out of 4 appliances, the model tuned using signatures extracted from aggregate data (AT) outperforms the current state of the art (FT) which uses a factorial HMM to tune appliance parameters.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">For the FT method, Gibbs sampling was used to approximate the posterior appliance models using a single sequence of aggregate data containing uses of all of the appliances of interest.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Having introduced a method by which general appliance models could be tuned to the specific appliances in a household given only aggregate data, and evaluated its performance using the REDD data set, we showed that the tuning process provides an improvement over using general appliance models and the current state-of-the-art tuning method.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The primary aim of tuning an appliance model is to learn the parameters required to disaggregate that appliance from the household aggregate load.</a>
