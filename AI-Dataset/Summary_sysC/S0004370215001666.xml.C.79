<a href="#0" id="0">Given a graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) and a discrete probability distribution {a mathematical formula}PD:{1, ⋯ ,n} → [0,1], identify the cardinal ranking of nodes that reflects the expected marginal contribution of each node to the group betweenness centrality of a random subset {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ V the size of which is drawn from PD and members of which are chosen uniformly at random from V.{sup:7}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We start our analysis by rewriting Equation (8) as:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}E[ ⋅ ] is the expected marginal contribution of node v to a random coalition {a mathematical formula}Sk − 1 drawn uniformly at random from the set {a mathematical formula}{S ⊆ V ∖ {v}:|S|=k − 1}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We start by defining pair-dependency as:{a mathematical formula} which is the positive contribution that all shortest paths between s and t make to the assessment of node v. The value of the function {a mathematical formula}f Δ depends solely on the distance between s and t. For instance, if we set {a mathematical formula}f Δ =1d(s,t) we obtain the distance-scaled betweenness centrality measure introduced by Borgatti and Everett [14].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Next, we define one-side dependency as:{a mathematical formula} which is the positive contribution that all shortest paths starting with node s make to the assessment of node v. Now, building upon the recursive equation proposed by Brandes [15], we obtain the following:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By transforming the second element of the inner sum {a mathematical formula}2 − d(s,v)2d(s,v)=1d(s,v) − 12 we find the following: In unweighted graphs, the Shapley value of the corresponding game (whose characteristic function assigns to each coalition its group betweenness centrality) is in fact the sum of the distanced-scaled betweenness centrality measures (introduced by Borgatti and Everett [14]) and the closeness centrality, shifted by half.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In weighted graphs, the pair-dependency limited to the shortest paths consisting of i nodes is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} This limited pair-dependency measures the influence of all shortest paths between s and t consisting of i nodes on the evaluation of node v. Note that the value of the function {a mathematical formula}f Δ ⁎ depends solely on the number of nodes lying on the shortest paths between s and t.</a>
