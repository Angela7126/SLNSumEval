<a href="#0" id="0">The group betweenness centrality of a set of nodes {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ V is defined as a function {a mathematical formula}cgb:2V → R such that:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Σ st(S) is the number of shortest paths from s to t passing through at least one node in S (if {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S or {a mathematical formula}t ∈ S then {a mathematical formula} Σ st(S)=0).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We note that the group betweenness centrality of an arbitrary {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ V is not, in general, equal to the sum of betweenness centralities of the nodes in S (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider again nodes {a mathematical formula}v1 and {a mathematical formula}v2 from Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We note that the Semivalue-based between centrality can be normalized to the interval {a mathematical formula}[0,1] just like we did earlier with the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to compute the standard betweenness centrality measure for all nodes, a naïve algorithm would first compute the number of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, and then for each node v sum up all pair-dependencies, which are defined as {a mathematical formula} Σ st(v) Σ st.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Additionally, the above equation allows us to compute the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure in {a mathematical formula}O(|V|3), but this result will be improved further.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This way, we can use our general framework — PBC, see Algorithm 1 — to compute the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure in {a mathematical formula}O(|V||E|).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This way, we can use Equation (23) along with our general framework, PBC, to compute the Semivalue-based betweenness centrality measure for unweighted graphs in {a mathematical formula}O(|V|2|E|) time.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Using the above equation, we are able to compute a parameterized betweenness centrality for weighted graphs {a mathematical formula}cfg ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">By doing so, we can use our general framework — WPBC, see Algorithm 4 — to compute the weighted Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure for all nodes in {a mathematical formula}O(|V|2|E|+|V|2log ⁡ |V|).</a>
