<a href="#0" id="0">In this article, we investigate three issues of term translation in the context of statistical machine translation and propose three corresponding models: (a) a term translation disambiguation model which selects desirable translations for terms in the source language with domain information, (b) a term translation consistency model that encourages consistent translations for terms with a high strength of translation consistency throughout a document, and (c) a term unithood model that rewards translation hypotheses where source terms are translated into target strings as a whole unit.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First, for the purpose of completeness, we provide a background introduction of SMT and topic modeling, more details about bilingual term extraction, especially how we pair monolingual terms into bilingual terms based on word alignments, as well as more details about how we calculate the proposed term translation consistency model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Second, we conduct new experiments to study the impact of the size of extracted bilingual term bank on the three models and the impact of topic information on the term translation consistency and unithood model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Normally, the log-linear model of SMT includes a language model that measures the fluency of a generated target translation, a translation model that estimates the probabilities of translation equivalents, a reordering model that captures the word order differences between the source and target language, as well as other models that incorporate knowledge useful for machine translation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Instead of simply counting the number of times of a term translation being used in previously translated sentences, we enable the decoder to detect terms that are highly consistently translated under given topics in training data with the proposed model, and encourage the decoder to translate these terms.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We compared our term translation consistency model against an alternative consistency method that rewards hypotheses with repeated terms from previously translated sentences.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this section, we will provide more details of our three term translation models from two distinct perspectives: extracted bilingual terms and translations generated by the baseline and the system enhanced with our models.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">On average, a source term has about 1.70 different translations ({a mathematical formula}1.81M/1.08M â‰ˆ 1.68).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">These statistics indicate that terms are frequently used in real-world data and that a source term can be translated into different target terms.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Second, we also present some bilingual term examples extracted from the training data in Table 15.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Accordingly, we show the total number of documents in which the corresponding source term occurs and the number of documents in which the corresponding source term is translated into different target terms.</a>
