<a href="#0" id="0">Second, term translation consistency is about consistent translations of terms that occur in the same document.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Term Translation Disambiguation Model: In this model, we condition the translations of source terms in different documents on the topic distributions of corresponding documents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Second, we conduct new experiments to study the impact of the size of extracted bilingual term bank on the three models and the impact of topic information on the term translation consistency and unithood model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The essential component of our term translation consistency model is the translation consistency strength of a source term estimated under the per-document topic distribution.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The k-th component measures the translation consistency strength {a mathematical formula}cons(tf,k) of the source term {a mathematical formula}tf given the topic k.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore we calculate the translation consistency strength of a source term {a mathematical formula}tf based on topic distributions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The term translation disambiguation model and consistency model concern the term translation accuracy with domain information.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, we can only integrate the term translation disambiguation model into SMT as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">What's the impact of the topic number k on the term translation disambiguation and consistency models that explore document-level topic information?</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">What's the impact of the size of extracted bilingual term bank on the term translation disambiguation and consistency model?</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We evaluated the term translation disambiguation, consistency and unithood models against the baseline systems.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We derived new variations of the term translation consistency and unithood models with or without topic information to study the impact of topic information on these two models.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Particularly, the term translation disambiguation model outperforms the “ CountFeat ” method by up to 0.45 BLEU points.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We also compared our term translation consistency model against another two models.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">“ Cons-No-Topic ” : This model is a simplified version of our term translation consistency model, which does not use any topic information.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Although these two models are better than the baseline and the “ CountFeat ” method as shown in Table 12, they are worse than our term translation consistency model.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This strongly suggest that terms are more consistently translated if we integrate the proposed term translation consistency model into the decoder.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Table 22 shows the translation probabilities of different target translations for the source term “ zhu3liu2 min2yi4 ” calculated by our term translation disambiguation model given the topic {a mathematical formula}z=32.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The differences between our term translation consistency model and their consistency index are twofold.</a>
