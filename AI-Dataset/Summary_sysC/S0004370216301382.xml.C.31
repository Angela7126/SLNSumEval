<a href="#0" id="0">Weighted maximum satisfiability and (unweighted) partial maximum satisfiability (PMS) are two significant generalizations of maximum satisfiability (MAX-SAT), and weighted partial maximum satisfiability (WPMS) is the combination of the two, with more important applications in practice.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Recently, great breakthroughs have been made on stochastic local search (SLS) for weighted MAX-SAT and PMS, resulting in several state-of-the-art SLS algorithms CCLS, Dist and DistUP.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, compared to the great progress of SLS on weighted MAX-SAT and PMS, the performance of SLS on WPMS lags far behind.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we present a new SLS algorithm named CCEHC for WPMS.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">CCEHC employs an extended framework of CCLS with a heuristic emphasizing hard clauses, called EHC.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">With strong accents on hard clauses, EHC has three components: a variable selection mechanism focusing on configuration checking based only on hard clauses, a weighting scheme for hard clauses, and a biased random walk component.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCEHC significantly outperforms its state-of-the-art SLS competitors.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The comparative results of CCEHC and its state-of-the-art SLS competitors DistUP, Dist and CCLS on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and four real-world application WPMS benchmarks are summarized in Table 4.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">According to the empirical results presented in Table 4, although CCEHC performs slightly slower than CCLS on the benchmark of advanced encryption standard and performs slightly slower than DistUP and Dist on the benchmark of cluster expansion, it is very apparent that, among these four competing SLS algorithms, our CCEHC algorithm performs best on the MSE2014_WPMS_Industrial benchmark and two real-world application WPMS benchmarks (i.e., ‘ Computational Protein Design ’ and ‘ Pedigree ’ ).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Particularly, the related experimental results indicate that our CCEHC algorithm is able to return better-quality solutions compared to CCLS, Dist and DistUP on a large number of real-world application instances.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In fact, SLS algorithms are considered to be ineffective on solving industrial WPMS instances and real-world application instances, so it is very difficult to improve such performance of SLS algorithms on these benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Time to activate the hard clause weighting scheme: The CCEHC algorithm activates the hard clause weighting scheme when there is no HCSCCD variable, while Dist does that when no decreasing variable exists.</a>
