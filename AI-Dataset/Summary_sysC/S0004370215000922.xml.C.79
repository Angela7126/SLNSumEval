<a href="#0" id="0">It was Thimm [44] who realized the importance of continuity as a Postulate for the probabilistic case, namely the property that a small change in the probability associated to formula (absent in the purely logical case) should lead only to small changes in the inconsistency measure.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A probabilistic conditional (or simply conditional) is a statement of the form {a mathematical formula}( Φ | Ψ )[q_,q¯], with the underlying meaning “ the probability that Φ is true given that Ψ is true lies within the interval {a mathematical formula}[q_,q¯] ” , where {a mathematical formula} Φ , Ψ ∈ LXn are propositional formulas and {a mathematical formula}q_,q¯ ∈ [0,1] are real numbers.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If any probability mass Π satisfying {a mathematical formula}( Φ | Ψ )[q_,q¯] implied {a mathematical formula}P Π ( Ψ )>0, in an alternative semantics, the latter restriction could be added to the program, although losing the linear program standard format; this is the semantics adopted by Muiño [31], for instance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When all interval bounds are rational numbers, PSAT is an NP-complete problem [12]; if there is a solution, there is a solution with only {a mathematical formula}m+1 possible worlds receiving positive probability mass, where m is the knowledge base size.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}K ({a mathematical formula}Kprec) be the set of all (precise) knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">An inconsistency measure for knowledge bases is a function {a mathematical formula}I:K → [0, ∞ ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thimm's investigation is restricted to measures {a mathematical formula}I:Kprec → [0, ∞ ) over knowledge bases with precise probabilities, to what we narrow our focus in this section.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">But no original conditional of Δ is in {a mathematical formula} Δ ′ , so none is innocuous.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Equivalently, any {a mathematical formula} Β ∈ Δ is inconsistent with {a mathematical formula} Δ ′ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">An example of innocuous conditional can be given in the knowledge base {a mathematical formula} Ψ = Δ ∪ {(x2)[0.3,0.8]}, since {a mathematical formula}(x2)[0.3,0.8] would be consistent with any consolidation of Ψ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The extra condition in the second item of Definition 4.12 forces consolidations of different knowledge bases {a mathematical formula} Δ i, Δ j ⊊ Γ with some probabilistic conditional in common to agree in that probability interval; otherwise, {a mathematical formula} ⋃ i=1k Δ i ′ would not be a knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The knowledge base is consistent iff these 2m restrictions can be jointly satisfied by a probability measure {a mathematical formula}P Π induced by a probability mass Π .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Potyka has proved that these measures, {a mathematical formula}Ip Ε with {a mathematical formula}p ∈ N>0 ∪ { ∞ }, besides being computable via linear programming, satisfy the postulates of consistency, continuity and monotonicity for the case of precise probabilities [34]: For any{a mathematical formula}p ∈ N>0 ∪ { ∞ },{a mathematical formula}Ip Ε :Kprec → [0, ∞ )is well-defined and satisfies consistency, continuity, weak independence and monotonicity.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">□ A knowledge base Γ is an inescapable conflict iff there is a widening{a mathematical formula} Γ ′ of Γ such that{a mathematical formula} Γ ′ is a minimal inconsistent set.</a>
