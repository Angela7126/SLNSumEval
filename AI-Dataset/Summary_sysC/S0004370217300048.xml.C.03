<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula} The expected utility of the CS player is:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We define the social welfare of an offer O at state s between a CS player and an {a mathematical formula}SPi player to be{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An offer O is a possible offer for a CS and a given {a mathematical formula}SPi player at state s if the following conditions hold:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The preferred offers for an {a mathematical formula}SPi player is a subset of possible offers that are strictly more beneficial to the CS player following the preferred path {a mathematical formula}Ps ⁎ and most beneficial for the {a mathematical formula}SPi.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore the only way for the CS player to receive the bonus in the game is to reach the goal of the {a mathematical formula}SPi player.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Similarly, the CS preferred offer to the {a mathematical formula}SPy requests all of the chips from the {a mathematical formula}SPy player.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The {a mathematical formula}SPg will accept the offer and the CS player will move one square to the gray goal, thereby ending the game.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If it is the turn of the SP players to make an offer, then the {a mathematical formula}SPg player will make the {a mathematical formula}SPg preferred offer {a mathematical formula}O ˆ s,g − of Definition 3, which is to offer all of its chips to the CS player.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The {a mathematical formula}SPy player will make the {a mathematical formula}SPy preferred offer {a mathematical formula}O ˆ s,y − of Definition 3, which is to offer all of its chips to the CS player.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The CS preferred offer towards the {a mathematical formula}SPg player will offer one yellow chip for all of its 10 red chips.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This offer represents a commitment (Definition 4) of the CS player towards the {a mathematical formula}SPg player.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The score for the CS player for this offer will be {a mathematical formula}20 ⋅ 5+150=250 and for the {a mathematical formula}SPg player will be {a mathematical formula}1 ⋅ 5+150=155.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The {a mathematical formula}SPy player cannot make an offer that will allow the CS player to reach the goal.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">According to the equilibrium strategy for the CS player it will follow {a mathematical formula}Ps ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Strategy for the CS player to make an offer: Suppose that the CS's player offer {a mathematical formula}O ˆ s is toward {a mathematical formula}SPi.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Let {a mathematical formula}Oi be the set of offers between the {a mathematical formula}SPi player and the CS player made by people in the HvsH setting.</a>
