<a href="#1" id="1">answering to Question 2, Question 3, Question 4 is {a mathematical formula}NP-hard.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Covering routeA covering route is a route r where {a mathematical formula}Ar(t) ≤ d(t) for any {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T(r).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Inter-set dominanceGiven a starting vertex v, a signal s and two different covering routes {a mathematical formula}r,r ′ , if {a mathematical formula}T(r) ⊃ T(r ′ ) then r dominates {a mathematical formula}r ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Covering setGiven a starting vertex v and a signal s, a covering set (covset) Q is a subset of {a mathematical formula}T(s) such that there exists a covering route r with {a mathematical formula}T(r)=Q.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">MAXIMALITYGiven a covering set {a mathematical formula}Q=T(r) for some r, we say that Q and r are maximal if there is no other covering route {a mathematical formula}r ′ such that {a mathematical formula}Q ⊂ T(r ′ ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The decision problem MAX – COV-SET is defined as:INSTANCE: an instance of SRG-v with a target set T and a covering set {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊂ T;QUESTION: is {a mathematical formula}T ′ maximal?</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The optimization version of k – SRG-v, say OPT – SRG-v, is{a mathematical formula}APX-hard even in the restricted case in which the graph is metric, there is only one signal s, all targets{a mathematical formula}t ∈ T(s)have the same penetration time{a mathematical formula}d(t), and there exists a maximal covering route covering all the targets.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this section we provide an algorithm to compute the strategies available to {a mathematical formula}D when v is the current vertex and signal s has been generated by the alarm system.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">w is not covered in the current covering set, that is {a mathematical formula}w ∈ T(s) ∖ Qv,tk;</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Consider for instance a graph with degree bounded by 3, Condition 3 allows us to generate in the worst case 3 new covering sets at each expansion round instead of {a mathematical formula}|T|.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We exploit two global set variables, {a mathematical formula}CLmin and {a mathematical formula}CLmax initially set to empty (Steps 1 – 2 of Algorithm 3).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Since all the vertices are possible starting points, we should face this hard problem (see Theorem 1) {a mathematical formula}|V| times, computing, for each signal, the covering routes from all the vertices.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To avoid this issue, we ask whether there exists an algorithm that in the worst case allows us to consider a number of iterations such that solving the problem for a given starting vertex v could help us finding the solution for another starting vertex {a mathematical formula}v ′ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In other words, considering a specific set of targets, we wonder whether a solution for COV-SET with starting vertex v can be used to derive, in polynomial time, a solution to COV-SET for another starting vertex {a mathematical formula}v ′ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This would allow us to solve an exponential-time problem only once instead of solving it for each vertex of the graph.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">penetration times are set to {a mathematical formula}|T| − 1;</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">5 the compute time (averaged over 100 SRG-v instances) required by our exact dynamic programming algorithm (Algorithm 1), with the annotation of dominated covering sets and the generation of the routes, as {a mathematical formula}|T| and Ε vary.</a>
