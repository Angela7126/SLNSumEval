<a href="#0" id="0">For an alternative {a mathematical formula}a ⁎ ∈ A and {a mathematical formula} Σ → ∈ (Sm)n, let{a mathematical formula} Given a preference profile {a mathematical formula} Σ → ∈ (Sm)n, an alternative {a mathematical formula}a ⁎ ∈ A, a vector of non-negative values {a mathematical formula}{pa}a ∈ A, and non-negative Β , define the set of inequalities {a mathematical formula}INEQ({pa}a ∈ A, Β , Σ → ,a ⁎ ) as follows:{a mathematical formula} The connection of this set of inequalities to randomized social choice functions is revealed in the following statement.A randomized social choice function f that uses probability distribution{a mathematical formula}{pa=Pr ⁡ [f( Σ → )=a]}a ∈ Afor profile{a mathematical formula} Σ → has distortion at most{a mathematical formula} Β − 1when{a mathematical formula} Β ∈ (0,1]with respect to utility profiles in{a mathematical formula}U( Σ → ,a ⁎ )if and only if the set of inequalities{a mathematical formula}INEQ({pa( Σ → )}a ∈ A, Β , Σ → ,a ⁎ )is satisfied.The fact that the distortion is at most {a mathematical formula} Β − 1 is equivalent to the following linear program having a non-negative objective value.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">□ We are now ready to define the worst-case optimal randomized social choice function {a mathematical formula}f ⁎ , i.e., the one that achieves optimal distortion {a mathematical formula} Β ( Σ → ) − 1 with respect to every profile {a mathematical formula} Σ → ∈ (Sm)n. To do so, we consider the probability distribution {a mathematical formula}{pa( Σ → )=Pr ⁡ [f ⁎ ( Σ → )=a]}a ∈ A as a set of variables and {a mathematical formula} Β ( Σ → ) as our objective that has to be maximized.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}Using Lemma 3.5 we find that the probability distribution obtained as (part of) the solution to this LP induces the lowest possible distortion {a mathematical formula} Β ( Σ → ) − 1 with respect to {a mathematical formula} Σ → .We conclude that in order to compute the worst-case optimal social choice function {a mathematical formula}f ⁎ with respect to any preference profile, it suffices to solve a linear program with {a mathematical formula}O(nm2) variables and {a mathematical formula}O(nm2) constraints.</a>
