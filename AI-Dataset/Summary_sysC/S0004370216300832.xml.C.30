<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we propose a number of new ideas for local search for PMS, which mainly rely on the distinction between hard and soft clauses.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Based on these ideas, we develop two local search algorithms for PMS called Dist and DistUP, the latter of which is an improved version of the former for industrial PMS instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The three ideas mentioned above are used in developing a local search algorithm for PMS dubbed Dist, as it makes effective use of Distinctions between hard and soft clauses.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Results of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2014 as well as our experiments show that Dist significantly outperforms previous local search solvers on all benchmarks from the MaxSAT Evaluation 2014, with a remarkable improvement in terms of the number of “ winning ” instances on structured PMS benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also compare Dist with latest state-of-the-art complete solvers and a state-of-the-art portfolio solver on PMS benchmarks from the MaxSAT Evaluation 2014.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Experimental results show that Dist outperforms the complete solvers on random and crafted benchmarks, while its performance on industrial instances is still considerably worse than complete solvers.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">PMS can be encoded as weighted MaxSAT where hard clauses are associated with a weight larger than the total weight of soft clauses.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A common variable property used in local search algorithms for weighted MaxSAT is the {a mathematical formula}score property, which is defined as the change on the total weight of satisfied clauses caused by flipping the variable.</a>
