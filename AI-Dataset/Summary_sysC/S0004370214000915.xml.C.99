<a href="#0" id="0">The intuition about {a mathematical formula}E1 is as follows: bridge rules in {a mathematical formula}E1 are crucial to create an inconsistency in M (i.e., {a mathematical formula}M[E1] ⊨ ⊥ ), moreover this inconsistency is relevant for M in the sense that adding some bridge rules from {a mathematical formula}br(M) to {a mathematical formula}M[E1] never yields a consistent system, i.e., {a mathematical formula}M[E1 ∪ R] ⊨ ⊥ for all {a mathematical formula}R ⊆ br(M).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, this can be achieved considering a transformed MCS: Consider {a mathematical formula}M=(C1, … ,Cn), then {a mathematical formula}Mr=(C1, … ,Cn,C Α ) is the transformed MCS where {a mathematical formula}C Α is a context whose acceptable belief states contain exactly those formulas added to it via bridge rules, e.g., {a mathematical formula}C Α uses the logic {a mathematical formula}Lasp and an empty knowledge base {a mathematical formula}kb Α = ∅ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our running example suggests that duality also holds for deletion-diagnoses and -explanations, which indeed is true: For every inconsistent MCS M,{a mathematical formula} ⋃ Dm − (M)= ⋃ Em+(M), i.e., the unions of all minimal deletion-diagnoses and all minimal deletion-inconsistency explanations coincide.This is a direct consequence of Theorem 4 (set in its proof the second components of diagnoses and explanations to the empty set).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For all complexity considerations, we represent logics {a mathematical formula}Li of contexts {a mathematical formula}Ciimplicitly; they are fixed and we do not consider these (possibly infinite) objects to be part of the input of the decision problems we investigate.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Accordingly, the instance size of a given MCS M will be denoted by {a mathematical formula}|M|=|kbM|+|br(M)| where {a mathematical formula}|kbM| denotes the size of knowledge bases in M and {a mathematical formula}|br(M)| denotes the size of its set of bridge rules.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Disregarding possible rule preferences, a logic program P with CR rules CR can be embedded to an MCS {a mathematical formula}M=(C1), where the single context {a mathematical formula}C1 is over disjunctive logic programs, such that the answer sets of P with CR correspond to the witnessing equilibria of the minimal diagnoses {a mathematical formula}(D1,D2) of M. In more detail, {a mathematical formula}C1 has the knowledge base {a mathematical formula}kb1=P ∪ {cr(r)|r ∈ CR} and bridge rules {a mathematical formula}br1={(c1:ab(r)) ← a ⊥ .|r ∈ CR}, where {a mathematical formula}a ⊥ and {a mathematical formula}ab(r) are fresh atoms, for each r as above, and{a mathematical formula} informally, unconditional firing of a bridge rule simulates the corresponding CR rule; note that {a mathematical formula}D1= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Indeed, for the MCS {a mathematical formula}M=(C1) with single context {a mathematical formula}C1 having knowledge base {a mathematical formula}kb1=K and bridge rules {a mathematical formula}br1=br Γ ⊤ ∪ br Γ ⊥ , where {a mathematical formula}br Γ ⊤ ={(c1: Φ ) ← (c1: ⊤ )| Φ ∈ Γ } and {a mathematical formula}br Γ ⊥ ={(c1: Φ ) ← (c1: ⊥ )| Φ ∈ Γ }, then the minimal diagnoses of M correspond to the repairs of K. One may replace Γ with {a mathematical formula} Γ O in both, {a mathematical formula}br Γ ⊤ and {a mathematical formula}br Γ ⊥ ; furthermore, modified bodies in {a mathematical formula}br Γ ⊤ allow for conditional removal of formulas, with conditions that might be beyond the expressiveness of the language of K. As regards explanations, our notion of explanation has no counterpart in the approach of [62].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This way we check the output-projected equilibrium property for all possible output-projected equilibria.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Therefore if no computation path accepts, then the MCS M is inconsistent.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If there is one path that accepts, then the output-projected belief state T corresponding to the guesses on this path is an output-projected equilibrium which fulfills all conditions of Definition 13.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Therefore M is consistent iff at least one path accepts.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Hence if C is closed under conjunction and projection, then the guess of size {a mathematical formula}O(|br(M)|) can be projected away (i.e., incorporated into {a mathematical formula}I ′ , see Section 5) and the complexity of MCSeq is in C. For {a mathematical formula}CC(M)=P (which is presumably not closed under projection) the complexity of MCSeq is in NP.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">□ (Membership) Given an MCS M and {a mathematical formula}D1,D2 ⊆ br(M), we solve two independent decision problems: (a) we decide whether {a mathematical formula}(D1,D2) is a diagnosis of M, and (b) we check whether a smaller diagnosis {a mathematical formula}(D ′ ,D ″ ) ⊂ (D1,D2) exists in M. We return ‘ yes ’ if (a) returns ‘ yes ’ and (b) returns ‘ no ’ .</a>
