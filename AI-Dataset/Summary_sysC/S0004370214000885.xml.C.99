<a href="#0" id="0">However, in a successful manipulation in the proof of Theorem 4, the manipulators are split between {a mathematical formula}p ≻ a ≻ b and {a mathematical formula}a ≻ p ≻ b, and switching the votes of the latter group into {a mathematical formula}p ≻ a ≻ b spoils the manipulation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The results in this section suggest that Baldwin's rule is arguably harder to manipulate because Nanson's rule is polynomial to manipulate with three candidates, and requires at least four candidates to be NP-hard, but Baldwin's is NP-hard already with three candidates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">More precisely, it first assigns n instances of {a mathematical formula}m − 1 to column p of the matrix (since it is best for the manipulators to put p in first place in their votes).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider an election in which the manipulators wish candidate {a mathematical formula}c8 to win, and 8 non-manipulators have voted as follows:{a mathematical formula} This gives the score vector for {a mathematical formula} 〈 c1, … ,c8 〉 of:{a mathematical formula} On this problem, Largest Fit finds an optimal manipulation that makes the final candidate win but Average Fit requires an additional vote.</a>
