<a href="#0" id="0">The negotiation issues are conflicting between the two agents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Here, the evaluation of a negotiation issue value for the opponent is given by 1 minus the evaluation of that negotiation issue value for the agent (e.g., the models proposed by Jazayeriy et al.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">[14] and Zhang et al.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These models consider the hypothesis space as the preference order of the negotiation issues as well as evaluation values of each negotiation issue.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">They update the probability of each hypothesis using the Bayesian formula in a consecutive manner as each offer is received from the opponent through the negotiation session.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">[16], [24], [26]) estimates the utility function of the opponent (which includes the estimated values for the weights of negotiation issues and estimated evaluation values for each negotiation issue value) through a Bayesian formula.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">No Model: the agent is without any model, hence the estimated utility of a given bid equals the utility of that bid in the opponent's utility space [36], [37].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As mentioned in Section 3, in bilateral multi-issue negotiations, the preference profile of an opponent is private to the agent.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Therefore, the agent has to learn it through offers as training instances received from the opponent and through a specific learning algorithm.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In linear scenarios, a preference profile is comprised of a number of negotiation issue weights {a mathematical formula}wiOP or priorities as well as the evaluations {a mathematical formula}evaliOP( Ω i) corresponding to each possible value {a mathematical formula} Ω i ∈ {vi1, ⋯ ,vimi}, where, {a mathematical formula}mi is the number of possible values for issue i ({a mathematical formula}i=1, … ,n).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since both the issue weights and evaluations of the opponent's preference profile are unknown to the agent, this proposed model applies two types of perceptron units[32] for learning the opponent's preferences through a multi bipartite incremental gradient descent search.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The second function receives an offer vector {a mathematical formula} Ω → which specifies the issue values for all the negotiation issues of a new offer recently received from the opponent.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To evaluate the proposed POPPONENT model, two separate experimental settings are applied for assessing its accuracy and performance (in real world negotiation examples) compared to the available opponent models.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">for automated bilateral multi issue negotiations [38] is also applied here to evaluate the accuracy of this proposed POPPONENT model versus the state of the art opponent models.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">As mentioned in Section 1, all of the existing models apply a subset of assumptions on the bidding strategy or on the value distribution of the issues of the opponent's preference profile.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Here, different opponents with different bidding strategies are applied in training the opponent model and to see how accurate each opponent model actually would be, when these assumptions would not hold true in the real world.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Finally, the utility of the bids that agent A sends to itself (side A) and to the opponent (side B), 1) when applying POPPONENT, and 2) when applying No Model are shown Fig.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In the setting adopted in Experiment I (Section 5.1.1), the accuracy of this proposed model is evaluated together with other opponent models through a Pearson Correlation between the estimated and real bid utilities [38]:{a mathematical formula} where, {a mathematical formula}uOP is the real utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ is the estimated utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP( Ω → ) is the real utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space, and {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ ( Ω → ) is the estimated utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space.</a>
