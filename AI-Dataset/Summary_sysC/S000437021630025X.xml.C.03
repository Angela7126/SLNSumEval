<a href="#0" id="0">Planning Domain (PD)A Planning Domain is a triple {a mathematical formula}PD= 〈 Var,Par,Act 〉 , where:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An action a is applicable on s if its preconditions hold at s, and its execution leads to a successor state {a mathematical formula}s ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These variables are generated automatically given a planning domain {a mathematical formula}PD.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given an action {a mathematical formula}a=(id(a),in(a),precond(a),effects(a)), we use the notation {a mathematical formula}precond(a)[i],prop[i] and {a mathematical formula}effect(a)[i] to indicate the preconditions, propositions and effects on the state variables corresponding to state i.</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">State transition systemA state transition system based on a planning domain extended with the knowledge-level representation {a mathematical formula}PD ′ = 〈 V,Par,Act 〉 is a triple {a mathematical formula} Σ = 〈 S,Act, Γ 〉 , such that:</a>

<a href="#14" id="14">In the next section, we formally describe when a plan Π has the potential to solve the planning problem P, i.e., when the application of Π yields an {a mathematical formula}S ˜ that satisfies the goal g.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We denote the index of the last state set in an execution path with {a mathematical formula}last(S ˜ ).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We say that an execution path {a mathematical formula}S ˜ = 〈 S0, Γ (S0), … , Γ k(S0) 〉 has the potential to solve the planning problem P given a set of initial states {a mathematical formula}S0 and a goal g, and we write {a mathematical formula}S ˜ ⊨ g if:</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">This implies that, setting aside uncertainty stemming from sensing effects, a plan has the potential to solve the planning problem if the goal is satisfied for all possible assignments to variables allowed by {a mathematical formula}prop_init.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">If, on the other hand, there is a sensing action with effect {a mathematical formula}sense(v), there is a plan that has the potential to satisfy the goal.</a>

<a href="#21" id="21">We call the sequence of actions {a mathematical formula} 〈 A0, … ,An 〉 in orch along with inPars the execution-level plan {a mathematical formula} Π e.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Thus, an orchestration comprising {a mathematical formula} Π e induces a sequence of state sets</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">An action a which is part of the updated plan is executed only if {a mathematical formula}precond(a) does not include any variable which is part of the effects pendEffects of any of the pending actions.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">In a domain consisting of 80 variables and respective actions which affect them, the planning time is 54 seconds for a domain range of {a mathematical formula}[1,10] and 125.5 for a domain range of {a mathematical formula}[1,104].</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">3 shows plan computation time with respect to an increasing number of variables with domain range {a mathematical formula}[1,100], which all have to be sensed to fulfill the goal.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Because the notion of state for the RuGPlanner encloses a set of fully instantiated states, the number of possible initial (instantiated) states of knowledge variables and their domain size affects planning time only with respect to the number of sensing actions which have to be included in the plan, their interdependencies, and entailed constraints.</a>
