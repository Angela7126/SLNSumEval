<a href="#0" id="0">However, unfortunately, local search algorithms for PMS do not benefit much from local search techniques for SAT and MaxSAT, mainly due to the fact that it contains both hard and soft clauses.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Local search algorithms for weighted MaxSAT can be used to solve PMS, as PMS can be encoded into weighted MaxSAT, by setting the weight of each soft clause as 1 and that of each hard clause as the number of soft clauses plus 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Although many local search techniques for SAT are also effective for solving MaxSAT, local search algorithms for PMS do not benefit that much from the techniques for SAT, mainly due to the fact that it contains both hard and soft clauses.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Based on these ideas, we develop two local search algorithms for PMS called Dist and DistUP, the latter of which is an improved version of the former for industrial PMS instances.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Previous local search algorithms for PMS also utilize the {a mathematical formula}score property to pick variables.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Previous local search algorithms for PMS utilize the score property, which can be seen as a weighted sum of hard score and soft score in the form of {a mathematical formula}A â‹… hscore(x)+sscore(x), where A is a positive integer number.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also note that Dist is the only local search solver that performs better than all complete solvers on crafted PMS instances, as witnessed by the results of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2014.</a>
