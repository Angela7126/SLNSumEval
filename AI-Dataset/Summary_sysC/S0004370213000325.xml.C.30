<a href="#0" id="0">For the general case in which the interval {a mathematical formula}[xmin,xmax] is continuous, the optimal search strategy must be derived using a different methodology since, as we prove in Theorem 1, the optimal search sequence is either a single search round in which the values of all agents are obtained or an infinite sequence of reservation values.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The sequence of reservation values that minimizes the expected cost of an iterative threshold search is either{a mathematical formula}[r1=xmax]or an infinite sequence{a mathematical formula}[r1,r2, … ],{a mathematical formula}ri<ri+1<xmax,{a mathematical formula} ∀ i ⩾ 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In contrast to Proposition 1, Proposition 2 states that the optimal strategy when there is no cost for initiating a new search round ({a mathematical formula} Α =0) is to increment the reservation value by the smallest amount possible, such that the expected number of values obtained is minimized.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The explanation of Proposition 3 requires understanding the tradeoff associated with any increase in P. By increasing P, the chance of finding each of the agents increases.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Each agent found due to the increased chance will incur a cost c. The benefit is that if the agent found due to the increase is the only agent found in that round, then the increase actually saves the expected cost {a mathematical formula}V(P) associated with continuing the search.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The probability that the latter case holds is {a mathematical formula}(1 − P)N − 1 (i.e., when all other agents are characterized with a value above the reservation value set using (12)).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If an increasing threshold search is to improve search costs, then a two-step strategy {a mathematical formula}S=[r1,r2=xmax] alone will provide some improvement [9].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The expected total cost when using this strategy is:{a mathematical formula} in which {a mathematical formula}P=F(r1).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The first two terms are the costs associated with the use of the first reservation value {a mathematical formula}r1, and the third term is the cost of obtaining all agent values if no values were obtained using {a mathematical formula}r1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The optimal two-step strategy is obtained by determining the value P that minimizes (15).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">4 shows the expected cost, the expected number of search rounds, and the 99.9th percentile of the number of search rounds required to find the best-valued agent as a function of the number of agents N, for the different values of Α and function assignments to {a mathematical formula} Β (j).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The figure also shows the reservation values to be used in each search round when {a mathematical formula}N=20.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As expected, Α has a substantial effect on the search strategy and expected cost.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The reservation value increases as a function of Α , since the tradeoff associated with each reservation value accounts for a greater cost of continuing the search if no agent is found.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Although the expected number of search rounds decreases as a consequence, the expected cost still increases, due to the greater cost per round.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For large values of Α and all {a mathematical formula} Β (j) cost functions, the reservation probability is set such that the expected number of search rounds is close to 1 due to the substantial cost of initiating a new search round.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As the following analysis shows, the increasing threshold search strategy that minimizes the expected search costs is based on a set of reservation probabilities {a mathematical formula}S={P0, … ,PK − 1}, where {a mathematical formula}Pk is the reservation probability to be used in any state {a mathematical formula}(r,k), {a mathematical formula}xmin ⩽ r<xmax, {a mathematical formula}0 ⩽ k<K.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The reservation value {a mathematical formula}r ′ in state {a mathematical formula}(r,k) can be calculated from the equation {a mathematical formula}r ′ =F − 1(Pk(1 − F(r))+F(r)).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">As in the single-agent search, we prove that this is the optimal strategy by first establishing that the optimal strategy to apply as long as only {a mathematical formula}k<K agents have been found is an infinite sequence of reservation values.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The increasing threshold search strategy that minimizes the expected search costs is to use the reservation value{a mathematical formula}r ′ in any state{a mathematical formula}(r,k)such that{a mathematical formula}F(r ′ |r)=Pk, for some{a mathematical formula}0<Pk ⩽ 1.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We illustrate the properties of the optimal search for multiple agents under the settings in Table 2 and compare it to an alternative strategy based on the single-agent search.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">In the alternative strategy, the searcher searches for one agent at a time, using the optimal P from (11) for {a mathematical formula}N − k agents when k agents have already been found.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">That is, the searcher begins by searching for one agent using P from (11).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Upon finding {a mathematical formula}k ⩾ 1 agents, the searcher begins a new search for one agent using P from (11), modified to reflect that only {a mathematical formula}N − k agents are left to reply, and that all remaining agent values are above the last reservation value used.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">As expected, the optimal reservation probability {a mathematical formula}Pk for the multi-agent search is substantially greater than the optimal reservation probability for a single-agent search.</a>
