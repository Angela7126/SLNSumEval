<a href="#1" id="1">An embedded coalition is a pair, {a mathematical formula}(C,CS), where C is a coalition, and CS is a coalition structure over A that contains C. That is, {a mathematical formula}CS ∈ Π A:C ∈ CS.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The set of all embedded coalitions will be denoted by EC.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Definition 3</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The coalition structure generation problem is the problem of finding a coalition structure over A whose value is maximal.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Such a coalition structure is said to be “ optimal ” , and is denoted by {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">More specifically, in CFGs, coalition structure generation is the problem of finding {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ ∈ argmaxCS ∈ Π AV(CS), while in PFGs it is the problem of finding {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ ∈ argmaxCS ∈ Π AW(CS).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Every node represents a coalition structure.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">These nodes are categorized into levels, {a mathematical formula} Π 1A, … , Π nA, where level {a mathematical formula} Π iA contains the nodes that represent all coalition structures containing exactly i coalitions.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">An edge connects two coalition structures if and only if: (1) they belong to two consecutive levels {a mathematical formula} Π iA and {a mathematical formula} Π i − 1A, and (2) the coalition structure in {a mathematical formula} Π iA can be obtained from the one in {a mathematical formula} Π i − 1A by splitting one coalition into two.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Every coalition structure in {a mathematical formula}TCS is the result of merging some (if not all) of the coalitions in CS that are connected via solid edges.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Here, the only constraint is that agents appearing at the two ends of a dashed edge must not appear together in the same coalition.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">the best solution in {a mathematical formula} Π A, i.e., {a mathematical formula}argmaxCS ∈ Π AW(CS), contains at mostxgroups,</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">and every one of those groups appears with its maximum value in some {a mathematical formula}CS ∈ Π ′ ,</a>
