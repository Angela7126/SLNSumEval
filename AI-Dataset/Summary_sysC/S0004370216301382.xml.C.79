<a href="#0" id="0">In SLS algorithms for solving WPMS, for a variable x, the hard make score of x, denoted by {a mathematical formula}hmake(x), is the number (or total weight if using clause weighting scheme) of unsatisfied hard clauses that would become satisfied if x is flipped; the hard break score of x, denoted by {a mathematical formula}hbreak(x), is the number (or total weight if using clause weighting scheme) of satisfied hard clauses that would become unsatisfied if x is flipped; the hard score of x, denoted by {a mathematical formula}hscore(x), is the increment in the number (or total weight if using clause weighting scheme) of satisfied hard clauses if x is flipped, and can be understood as {a mathematical formula}hscore(x)=hmake(x) − hbreak(x)[3]; the soft make score of x, denoted by {a mathematical formula}smake(x), is the total weight of unsatisfied soft clauses that would become satisfied if x is flipped; the soft break score of x, denoted by {a mathematical formula}sbreak(x), is the total weight of satisfied soft clauses that would become unsatisfied if x is flipped; the soft score of x, denoted by {a mathematical formula}sscore(x), is the increment in the total weight of satisfied soft clauses if x is flipped, and can be understood as {a mathematical formula}sscore(x)=smake(x) − sbreak(x)[3].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Most SLS algorithms do not separate hard clauses and soft clauses, and use the concepts of general make score, break score and score properties to select variables to be flipped: for a variable x, the make score of x, denoted by {a mathematical formula}make(x), can be calculated as {a mathematical formula}make(x)=A×hmake(x)+smake(x); the break score of x, denoted by {a mathematical formula}break(x), can be calculated as {a mathematical formula}break(x)=A×hbreak(x)+sbreak(x); the score of x, denoted by {a mathematical formula}score(x), can be calculated as {a mathematical formula}score(x)=A×hscore(x)+sscore(x), and can also be seen as {a mathematical formula}score(x)=make(x) − break(x), where A in {a mathematical formula}make(x), {a mathematical formula}break(x) and {a mathematical formula}score(x) is a positive integer whose value is usually set to the total weight of all soft clauses plus 1.</a>
