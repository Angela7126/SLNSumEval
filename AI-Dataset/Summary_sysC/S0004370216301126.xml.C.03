<a href="#0" id="0">We associate each allocation A that is reached in a sequence of deals with a function {a mathematical formula} Π :N → R mapping agents to the sum of payments they have made so far, i.e., we also have {a mathematical formula} ∑ i Π (i)=0.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A state of the system is a pair {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) of an allocation A and a payment balance Π .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If our agents are only willing to negotiate 1-deals, then we will remain stuck in this suboptimal allocation and never reach {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Compute an allocation {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ that maximises social welfare.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As demonstrated by Theorem 1, our distributed negotiation procedure is capable of selecting an allocation {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ with maximal social welfare.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This forces the following payments for a deal {a mathematical formula} Δ =(A,A ′ ), with Π being the payment balance for allocation A and {a mathematical formula} Π ′ being the payment balance for {a mathematical formula}A ′ :{a mathematical formula} But this is exactly the GUPF, defined in Section 2.4.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As we are using the Knaster payment scheme, any state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) reached during negotiation will satisfy {a mathematical formula} Π (i)=exi(A) − Ex(A)/n for each agent i.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The only efficient allocation here is {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ , which assigns {a mathematical formula}{g1,g2} to agent 1 and {a mathematical formula}{g3,g4} to agent 3 and which has a social welfare of 20.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For convergence to an efficient allocation by means of IR deals, {a mathematical formula}nm − 1, with n being the number of agents and m being the number of goods, is known to be a (tight) upper bound on the longest path, i.e., there exist profiles of valuation functions and initial allocations such that it is possible to visit all allocations before convergence [29].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Take a scenario where the agents have the valuation functions used in the proof of Lemma 6, except that {a mathematical formula}vn(G) is set to such a high value that the only way of achieving a proportional state is to give all goods to agent n (because no payments the other agents would be prepared to make could be large enough to give utility {a mathematical formula}vn(G)/n to agent n).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ be such an efficient allocation.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We show that a payment balance {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ can be arranged such that the state {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ) is EEF.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Now let {a mathematical formula}i,j ∈ N be any two agents in the system.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We show that i does not envy j in state {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Π ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We first show that the following invariant will be true for every state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) and every agent i, provided that agents only negotiate IR deals using the GUPF:{a mathematical formula} Our proof proceeds by induction over the number of deals negotiated.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Let {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ be that final allocation, and let {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ be the associated payment balance.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Consider the allocation A in which agent 1 owns {a mathematical formula}g1 and agent 2 owns {a mathematical formula}g2.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Recall from the proof of Theorem 8 that the use of the GUPF together with initial equitability payments ensures that we get a payment balance satisfying {a mathematical formula} Π (i)=vi(A) − sw(A)/n for every state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π ) reached during negotiation and every agent {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The associated payment balance will be {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ (i)=vi(A ⁎ ) − sw(A ⁎ )/n.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We consider once more the allocation problem of Table 1, but now the agents are arranged on a line, with agent 1 in the middle position, i.e., {a mathematical formula}E={(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1)}.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Agent 2 does not envy agent 1, as {a mathematical formula}u2(A ′ (1), Π ′ (1))=8 − 12/3=12/3<18/3</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Suppose again there are three agents on a line, the payment balance is currently 0 for all agents, and the valuation function of agent 3 is {a mathematical formula}v3(S)=0 for any {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ G.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Then agents 1 and 2 can go through all {a mathematical formula}2m allocations that divide all goods between the two of them and end up in the allocation where agent 2 owns all items (that is, there are {a mathematical formula}2m − 1 IR deals between them).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">How much does agent i envy agent j in state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π )?</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">How envious is a single agent i in state {a mathematical formula}(A, Π )?</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Such a weaker axiom would allow us to distinguish, say, a situation where {a mathematical formula}n − 1 agents all envy the nth agent from a situation where the same {a mathematical formula}n − 1 agents all envy a different agent, which may be useful in some circumstances.</a>
