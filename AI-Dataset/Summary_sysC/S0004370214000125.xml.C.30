<a href="#1" id="1">This leads to the definition of generalized aspects[4] as maximal sets of nonsingular configurations {a mathematical formula}(x,q) that can all be connected within Σ without crossing any singularity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">More formally, the set of nonsingular configurations of the robot is{a mathematical formula} This corresponds, e.g., to the four quarters of circle in the left hand side graphic of Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As illustrated by this diagram, {a mathematical formula} Σ ⁎ is generally made of several connected components.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{sup:2} Formally, the generalized aspects of the robots are defined to be the connected components of (3).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The proposed method for the generalized aspect computation relies on solving the following NCSP whose solutions are the nonsingular configurations of the robot:{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula} Σ ([x],[q]) be the solution set of this NCSP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our method computes a set of boxes partly covering this solution set.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This set of boxes is partitioned into subsets that represent fully certified approximations of the aspects of the considered robot, in terms of both solution existence and connectedness within the solution set.</a>
