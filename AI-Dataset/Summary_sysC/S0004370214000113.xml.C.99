<a href="#0" id="0">In our approach, we go a step further because our model is able to predict faulty behavior too.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus we can provide a more precise set of candidates if we take into account how faults are related to parameters [11], [32]: FaultA fault is a deviation of exactly one parameter of the system model from its nominal value.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A fault is denoted as f, and it is modeled, in our work, as an unexpected step change in a system model parameter value, {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ Θ , and F represents the fault set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we focus on the problem where the diagnosis model {a mathematical formula}S is diagnosable and the user provides the initial distribution of the measurement and fault sets.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, from the subset {a mathematical formula}Fi of fault candidates, the parameter estimation block performs fault identification to determine the fault that has occurred in the system (described by the parameter associated to the fault, {a mathematical formula} Θ i ⁎ ), together with its estimation accuracy, {a mathematical formula}Ei2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Each PC contains a subset of the parameters in the system, and can be used to estimate any combination of these subsets of parameters.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, PC {a mathematical formula}Mh1 can be used to estimate the subset of parameters {a mathematical formula}{A1}, {a mathematical formula}{Re1}, {a mathematical formula}{Re12}, {a mathematical formula}{A1,Re1}, {a mathematical formula}{A1,Re12}, {a mathematical formula}{Re1,Re12}, or {a mathematical formula}{A1,Re1,Re12}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Table 7 shows the design results using PC-based residuals.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As shown in Table 6, Table 7, using PC-based residuals the design results are improved in two different ways: (1) the size of the local diagnosers for diagnosis submodels {a mathematical formula}S1 to {a mathematical formula}S4 after the design process is smaller than the size of the diagnosers using {a mathematical formula}M-based residuals (using PC-based residuals, only one additional residual, instead of two, is needed); and (2), PC-based residuals allow to have a fully distributed approach, not only regarding local diagnosers, but also regarding the residual generators (with {a mathematical formula}M-based residuals the diagnosis process will be distributed, but the residual computation will still be centralized).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Having shown the design properties of our distributed framework, the next section shows the performance of the distributed diagnosis approach using simulated data for several fault diagnosis experiments and compares the results obtained against a centralized approach.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As a particular example to demonstrate on-line diagnosis in this framework, consider a 20% friction increase in the front-left wheel of the rover, {a mathematical formula} Μ f,FL+, occurring at time 50 s. Fig.</a>
