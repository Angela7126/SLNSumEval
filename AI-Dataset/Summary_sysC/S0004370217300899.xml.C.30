<a href="#0" id="0">A game G is weakly-FIP if there is some scheduler Φ such that {a mathematical formula} 〈 G,a0, Φ 〉 converges for any {a mathematical formula}a0.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A game G is order-free-FIP (or, order-free acyclic) if there is some action scheduler{a mathematical formula} Φ A such that {a mathematical formula} 〈 G,a0,( Φ N, Φ A) 〉 converges for any {a mathematical formula}a0 and {a mathematical formula} Φ N[7].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Convergence from the truth We say that a game G is FIP from state a if {a mathematical formula} 〈 G,a, Φ 〉 converges for any Φ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Clearly, a game is FIP iff it is FIP from a for any {a mathematical formula}a ∈ An.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We are particularly interested in convergence from the truthful state {a mathematical formula}a ⁎ .</a>

<a href="#13" id="13">At {a mathematical formula}t ′ − 1, {a mathematical formula}d=c is the (only) candidate with a score of at least {a mathematical formula}s¯+1.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">At {a mathematical formula}t ′ − 1, candidates {a mathematical formula}c,c ′ have scores of at least {a mathematical formula}s¯, and d is one of them (w.l.o.g.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula}d=c).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Proposition 4.3 in particular implies that {a mathematical formula}fPL is not FIP.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">{a mathematical formula}fPLis not FIP even from the truthful state.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Suppose that there are{a mathematical formula}n=2weighted voters, and that at some state{a mathematical formula}t ′ both voters vote for distinct candidates, and one of these candidates is the winner.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Then the score of the winner is strictly higher at any later state{a mathematical formula}t>t ′ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Let state {a mathematical formula}t ′ >2 be any state where voters vote for two distinct candidates.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">{a mathematical formula}t ′ is even, meaning voter 2 just moved to y from some other candidate.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">By our restriction to direct replies, {a mathematical formula}cwt ′ =y.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Thus at state {a mathematical formula}a1 at least one voter (w.l.o.g.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">voter 2) is voting for the winner {a mathematical formula}a21=cw1=x.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">If {a mathematical formula}a11=x as well then we are done since neither voter will want to move.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Otherwise, the voters are voting for distinct candidates and thus by Lemma 4.7, the score of the winner must increase in every step until convergence.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Let {a mathematical formula}Fs ˆ ,wP denote the game form that maps any state {a mathematical formula}a ∈ An to the set {a mathematical formula}argmaxc ∈ Css ˆ ,w,a(c) (all candidates with maximal Plurality score).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Let {a mathematical formula}Wt=FP(at) ⊆ C denote the set of winners at time t. We thus define a direct reply {a mathematical formula}ait − 1 → iait as one where {a mathematical formula}ait ∈ Wt.</a>

<a href="#31" id="31">{a mathematical formula}fPRis not FIP.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">We have seen in Section 4 that while {a mathematical formula}fPR is FBRP from the truthful initial state, this is no longer true from arbitrary states, and in fact {a mathematical formula}fPR is not order-free-FIP under any action scheduler.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Our main theorem in this section shows that under a certain scheduler (of both agents and actions), convergence is guaranteed from any state.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Further, this still holds if actions are restricted to direct replies.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">All scores specified below are in the game {a mathematical formula}Gb0.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Case 1.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">{a mathematical formula}|f(b0)|>1 and {a mathematical formula}bi ⁎ ∈ f(b0) (i.e {a mathematical formula}bi ⁎ is one of several winners).</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Then consider the step {a mathematical formula}b0 → ibi ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">This make {a mathematical formula}bi ⁎ the unique winner, and thus it is a direct best reply for i.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">In the new state {a mathematical formula}b ′ =(b − i0,bi ⁎ ), and we have {a mathematical formula}T(b ′ )=T(b0) ∪ {i}.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">{a mathematical formula}s0(bi ⁎ )=sw0 − 1 (i.e., {a mathematical formula}bi ⁎ needs one more vote to become a winner).</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">By Axioms G and R, i prefers {a mathematical formula}f(b − i0,bi ⁎ ) over {a mathematical formula}f(b0).</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">Then similarly to case 1, i has a direct step {a mathematical formula}b0 → ibi ⁎ , which results in a state {a mathematical formula}b ′ that is closer to being truthful.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">There is a unique winner {a mathematical formula}x=f(b0), and {a mathematical formula}s0(x) ≥ s0(y)+2 for all other candidates (note that there has to be an equality for at least one candidate, or else there is no better reply).</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Then the next step (by some voter j) must be from x, which brings us to one of the Cases 1, 2 (if {a mathematical formula}s0(bi ⁎ )=sw0 − 2) or in Case 4 (if {a mathematical formula}s0(bi ⁎ )<sw0 − 2).</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">Case 6.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">For any{a mathematical formula}n ≥ 7, there is a non-separable game form{a mathematical formula}fn ⁎ with n agents s.t.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">{a mathematical formula}fn ⁎ is FIP.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">1.</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">{a mathematical formula}|f(at − 1)| ≥ 2.</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">Then since step t must be a direct reply, it must be to some candidate z with {a mathematical formula}st − 1(z) ≥ swt − 1 − 1.</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">Also, either {a mathematical formula}xt − 1 or {a mathematical formula}yt − 1 did not lose votes (w.l.o.g.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">{a mathematical formula}xt − 1).</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">Thus {a mathematical formula}st(x),st(z) ≥ swt − 1 ≥ st − 1(z)+2 ≥ st(z)+2.</a>
