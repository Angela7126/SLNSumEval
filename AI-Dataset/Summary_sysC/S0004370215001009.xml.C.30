<a href="#0" id="0">The definition does not exactly define a probability distribution as it contains imprecise knowledge, but we can define a probability distribution consistent with the definition for those two random variables by the following assignments:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} From this one can compute the probability of for instance {a mathematical formula}P(DM=true):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}AV is an event space representing events concerning the random variables V;</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each {a mathematical formula}Ck defines a set of probability measures, given by the following definition.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Assume we have random variables {a mathematical formula}V1 and {a mathematical formula}V2 with the range of real numbers and the corresponding credal set specification {a mathematical formula}{(0.25, Ω 1<0 ∧ Ω 2<0),(0.25, Ω 1<0 ∧ Ω 2>0),(0.25, Ω 1>0 ∧ Ω 2<0),(0.25, Ω 1>0 ∧ Ω 2>0)}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this article we make use of two constraint theories which were already used in the examples before: real numbers (R) and discrete constants (D).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">New here is the definition of credal set specifications for a countable number of variables in the sense of Section 5.2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We define credal sets by a number of random variable definitions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Random variable definitions define credal sets for groups of finitely many random variables, such that the definition of each random variable depends only on a finite number of other ones.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Definitions have the form:{a mathematical formula} where each {a mathematical formula}Vi is a random variable label, {a mathematical formula}Xi is a parameter, {a mathematical formula}pi is a probability and {a mathematical formula} Φ i is a constraint.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A PCLP program defines a credal set over all random variables{a mathematical formula}V1,V2, … occurring in it.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The lower and upper probability bounds of a query q, concerning only the first n random variables, in a PCLP program, fulfilling the exact inference conditions, can be computed as:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}HereCis the credal set specification defined by the program (Lemma 4).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">By Corollary 1 it is clear that computing the lower and upperbound of a PCLP query has the same complexity.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Therefore, the problem that we consider is, given the solution constraint of a query q and any probability p, is {a mathematical formula}P_(q)>p?</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We first show that, given the complexity of constraint checking {a mathematical formula}C, this problem is in {a mathematical formula}PPC.</a>
