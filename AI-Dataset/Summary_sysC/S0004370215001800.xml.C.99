<a href="#0" id="0">Note that, since an argument graph G represents the relations of rational support holding amongst sentences, then the agent has an argument for any {a mathematical formula}s ∈ L if {a mathematical formula}s ∈ v(G).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, it is appropriate to define a relation of attack between argument graphs, {a mathematical formula}G ⇝ G ′ , allowing the sentence in G that is contrary of the attacked assumption in {a mathematical formula}G ′ to feature anywhere in G. This contrasts with the definition of attack in tree-based ABA, in which only the claim — i.e., the root — of the argument is relevant.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As shown above, for an argument graph G there may in general be several maximally rule-consistent {a mathematical formula}R such that {a mathematical formula}rules(G) ⊆ R.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, different argument graph characteristic functions can be applied to G to yield (possibly) ⊆ -larger argument graphs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For let {a mathematical formula}A be the set of arguments that are either represented in {a mathematical formula}G1 or in {a mathematical formula}G4; {a mathematical formula}A is the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Both {a mathematical formula}G1 and {a mathematical formula}G4 are conversions of {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since {a mathematical formula}G1 is grounded, then (iii) is confirmed, but the fact that {a mathematical formula}G4 is not grounded shows that we cannot strengthen the existential quantifier.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note that, as a corollary of this result and existing results on existence of grounded and admissible extensions for all ABA frameworks [6], [11], grounded and admissible argument graphs are also always guaranteed to exist, for any ABA framework.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that this definition implies that, if O is an argument graph set and {a mathematical formula}O= ∅ , then {a mathematical formula}u(O)= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For A2, again, it is plain that, in the proponent case (1), all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ u(Pi) must eventually be selected and treated according to Definition 5.5 — intuitively, all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ u(Pi) are pending proof, and if the potential argument graph is to become an actual argument graph, everything the proponent needs to support or defend must be proved.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">An ABA framework only admits the possibility of circular arguments if it is not p-acyclic; this notion is defined in [14], and the definition is equivalent to: Let the dependency graph of{a mathematical formula}(L,R,A,ss ‾ ) be the directed graph whose nodes are {a mathematical formula}L ∖ A and where there is a directed edge {a mathematical formula}(s,s ′ ) iff there is a rule {a mathematical formula}s ← B ∈ R such that {a mathematical formula}s ′ ∈ B.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}(L,R,A,ss ‾ ) is p-acyclic iff the dependency graph of {a mathematical formula}(L,R,A,ss ‾ ) is acyclic.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This is to be expected: there is a single grounded extension in the case of standard, tree-based semantics for {a mathematical formula}(L,R,A,ss ‾ ), of which the set of arguments found by proxdd in a grounded dispute derivation must be an admissible subset; yet there can often be many grounded argument graphs, giving rise to a larger number of solutions for the latter.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">It might be thought that the explanation for this is the fact that, as {a mathematical formula}|L| gets larger without any other parameters being affected, the likelihood increases that sentences in {a mathematical formula}v(Pi), at any stage of an X-graph-DS, will not be the head of a rule — and so that as {a mathematical formula}|L| increases the number of admissible argument graphs containing s must diminish.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Incorporating this into the definition of a grn-graph-DD allows us to prove the completeness of our procedures in Theorem 5.12; the adaptation is a matter of paying attention to the internal structure of arguments, so that the {a mathematical formula}Gi is defined over sentences instead of arguments.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">there is a focused argument graph G, with{a mathematical formula}claim(a)=claim(G)and{a mathematical formula}support(G) ⊆ support(a);if G is a graphical conversion of some{a mathematical formula}a ′ such that{a mathematical formula}reduce(a,a ′ ), then G is a graphical conversion of{a mathematical formula}a(cf.Definition 4.5for the notion of graphical conversion).We now prove the parts i – iii of</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Assume {a mathematical formula}A is complete; then it is admissible, and so G is admissible by (i) of the present theorem.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In light of Theorem 4.19.ii, we must show that there is no {a mathematical formula}G ′ with {a mathematical formula}G ⊂ G ′ , such that for all {a mathematical formula}G ⁎ where {a mathematical formula}G ⁎ ⇝ G ′ , {a mathematical formula}G ⇝ G ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Thus assume that there is such an argument graph {a mathematical formula}G ′ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Let {a mathematical formula}a be an argument represented in {a mathematical formula}G ′ but not in G (since {a mathematical formula}G ⊂ G ′ there must be such an argument).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Suppose {a mathematical formula}b ⇝ a, and let {a mathematical formula}Gb be a conversion of {a mathematical formula}b; it must then be that {a mathematical formula}Gb ⇝ G ′ .</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">So by assumption, {a mathematical formula}G ⇝ Gb.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">But this means that {a mathematical formula}A ⇝ b, so that {a mathematical formula}A defends {a mathematical formula}a.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">But then {a mathematical formula}A cannot be complete — contradiction.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">So there is no such {a mathematical formula}G ′ , and G is complete.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Let {a mathematical formula}Gs be the focused argument graph whose claim is s, such that {a mathematical formula}rules(Gs) ⊆ R (this can easily be shown to exist), and let {a mathematical formula}G+ be {a mathematical formula}Gs ∪ fRi( ◊ ); {a mathematical formula}G+ is easily shown to be an argument graph.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Thirdly, we present the proof itself, the core of which is by induction.An argument graph dispute tree{a mathematical formula}T for {a mathematical formula}s ∈ L is defined as follows:</a>
