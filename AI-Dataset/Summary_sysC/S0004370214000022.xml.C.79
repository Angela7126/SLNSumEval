<a href="#0" id="0">An (epistemic probability) structure (over Φ ) has the form{a mathematical formula} where Ω is the state space, and for each {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N, {a mathematical formula} Π i is a partition of Ω , {a mathematical formula}Pi is a function that assigns to each {a mathematical formula} Ω ∈ Ω a probability space {a mathematical formula}Pi( Ω )=( Ω i, Ω ,Fi, Ω , Μ i, Ω ), and {a mathematical formula} Π i is an interpretation that associates with each state a truth assignment to the primitive propositions in Φ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since the formulas in {a mathematical formula} Φ ⁎ are not composed of probability formulas, and thus do not involve any reasoning about interpretations, we can extend the function {a mathematical formula} Π i( ⋅ ) to {a mathematical formula} Φ ⁎ in a straightforward way, and write {a mathematical formula}[[ Φ ]]i for the set of the states of the world where the formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Φ ⁎ is true according to i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Roughly speaking, this means that {a mathematical formula} Π i( Ω ) should consist of all states where the formula {a mathematical formula} Φ i, Ω is true.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">More precisely, we take {a mathematical formula} Π i( Ω ) to consist of all states where {a mathematical formula} Φ i, Ω is true according to i.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If player j understands that i may be using a different interpretation than he does (i.e., the appropriate semantics are the innermost-scope semantics), then j correctly infers that the set of states that i thinks are possible in Ω is {a mathematical formula} Π i( Ω )=[[ Φ i, Ω ]]i.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">But if j does not understand that i may interpret formulas in a different way (i.e., under outermost scope), then he thinks that the set of states that i thinks are possible in Ω is given by {a mathematical formula}[[ Φ i, Ω ]]j.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Of course, {a mathematical formula}[[ Φ i, Ω ]]j does not in general coincide with {a mathematical formula} Π i( Ω ).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Indeed, {a mathematical formula}[[ Φ i, Ω ]]j may even be empty.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Specifically, we have primitive propositions of the form {a mathematical formula}(p,i), that can be interpreted as “ i's interpretation of p. ” With this extended language, we do not need to have a different interpretation function {a mathematical formula} Π i for each i; it suffices in a precise sense to use a single (common) interpretation function.</a>
