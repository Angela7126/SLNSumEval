<a href="#1" id="1">Identification problem/learnabilityGiven a bias B, a training set E on a vocabulary {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,D 〉 , and a type {a mathematical formula}TQ ∈ {membership,equivalence} of queries, the identification problem for a target concept f representable by Γ is to find a sequence {a mathematical formula} 〈 q1, ⋯ ,qm 〉 of queries of type TQ leading to the detection of a constraint network C representing f. If the length m of the sequence is polynomial in the number {a mathematical formula}|B| of constraints in the bias, we say that f is learnable by queries of type TQ.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The basic building block of our learning architecture is a clausal representation of version spaces for constraint biases.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a prefixed vocabulary {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,D 〉 and a bias B, the version space {a mathematical formula}CB(E) of a training set E is encoded into a clausal theory T, where each model of T is a representation of some concept in {a mathematical formula}CB(E).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The size of T is linear in the number of examples, and its structure allows us to check satisfiability in polynomial time.</a>
