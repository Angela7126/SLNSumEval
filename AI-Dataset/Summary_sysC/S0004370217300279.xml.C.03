<a href="#2" id="2">Covering routeA covering route is a route r where {a mathematical formula}Ar(t) ≤ d(t) for any {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T(r).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Covering routes are abstractions for {a mathematical formula}D's available pure strategies when the current vertex is v and a signal s has been generated.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Covering routes then constitute the action space for {a mathematical formula}D is a SRG-v game.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Covering setGiven a starting vertex v and a signal s, a covering set (covset) Q is a subset of {a mathematical formula}T(s) such that there exists a covering route r with {a mathematical formula}T(r)=Q.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}O(|T(s)||T(s)|).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, computing a covering route for a given set of targets (or deciding that no covering route exists) is not doable in polynomial time unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this section we provide an algorithm to compute the strategies available to {a mathematical formula}D when v is the current vertex and signal s has been generated by the alarm system.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We denote a covering set by {a mathematical formula}Qv,tk where k indicates its cardinality while v and t denote the starting vertex of {a mathematical formula}D and the last target added to the set, respectively.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The algorithm operates in such a way that the sequence of targets corresponding to the expansions made to obtain {a mathematical formula}Qv,tk is a covering route for that set.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore, dominated covering sets can be annotated with a {a mathematical formula}O(|T(s)|3) extra cost at each iteration of Algorithm 1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In that case, the optimal expected utility of {a mathematical formula}D is 1.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As a result, Algorithm 4 generates at most {a mathematical formula}|T(s)| covering routes.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Once the whole algorithm terminates, {a mathematical formula}CLmax contains the final solution.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In this case, the only guarantees that can be provided for each covering route {a mathematical formula}r ∈ CLmax, once the algorithm terminates are:</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We focus on the problem of finding the best patrolling strategy given that we know the best signal – response strategy for each vertex v in which {a mathematical formula}D can place.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">This is because the branch-and-bound algorithm has a complexity {a mathematical formula}O(|T||T|), while the dynamic programming algorithm has a complexity {a mathematical formula}O(2|T|).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The algorithm always terminates by the deadline for only {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ {0.75,1.00}.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We report experimental results only for {a mathematical formula} Ε ∈ {0.05,0.25}.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This shows that there is not an algorithm outperforming the other for every combination of parameters {a mathematical formula}|T| and Ε .</a>

<a href="#23" id="23">{a mathematical formula} Π (t)=1, for every {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T(s);</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">By construction of the SRG-v instance, there is a covering route starting from v and visiting all the targets {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T(s), each within its penetration time.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">We assume there is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with {a mathematical formula}APXSRG/OPTSRG ≥ Β where {a mathematical formula} Β ∈ (0,1).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">{a mathematical formula}OPTTSPoracle.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">This makes the number of expansions performed by the algorithm {a mathematical formula}O(|T(s)|2).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">We conjecture that the problem is {a mathematical formula}FNP-hard.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">This is because the number of edges increases as Ε increases and so the number of covering sets increases approaching {a mathematical formula}2|T|.</a>
