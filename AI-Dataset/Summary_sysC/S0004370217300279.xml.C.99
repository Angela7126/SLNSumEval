<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:6} Notice that, the exponential size of the game tree does not constitute a proof that finding the equilibrium strategies of an SRG-v requires exponential time in the parameters of the game because it does not exclude the existence of some compact representation of {a mathematical formula}D's strategies, e.g., Markovian strategies.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">MAXIMALITYGiven a covering set {a mathematical formula}Q=T(r) for some r, we say that Q and r are maximal if there is no other covering route {a mathematical formula}r ′ such that {a mathematical formula}Q ⊂ T(r ′ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the best case, when there is a route covering all the targets, the number of maximal covering sets is 1 (and we can safely restrict to a single minimum cost covering route over that set), while the number of covering sets (including the non-maximal ones) is {a mathematical formula}2|T(s)|.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, considering only maximal covering sets allows an exponential reduction of the payoffs matrix.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the worst case, when all the possible subsets composed of {a mathematical formula}|T(s)|/2 targets are maximal covering sets, the number of maximal covering sets is {a mathematical formula}O(2|T(s)| − 2), while the number of covering sets is {a mathematical formula}O(2|T(s)| − 1), allowing a reduction of the payoffs matrix by a factor of 2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The decision problem MAX – COV-SET is defined as:INSTANCE: an instance of SRG-v with a target set T and a covering set {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊂ T;QUESTION: is {a mathematical formula}T ′ maximal?</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The optimization version of k – SRG-v, say OPT – SRG-v, is{a mathematical formula}APX-hard even in the restricted case in which the graph is metric, there is only one signal s, all targets{a mathematical formula}t ∈ T(s)have the same penetration time{a mathematical formula}d(t), and there exists a maximal covering route covering all the targets.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If otherwise, the condition is verified, then the algorithm (assuming validity of Conditions 1 and 2) might obtain a covering set {a mathematical formula}Q¯v,wk+1 which is not a proper one, meaning that by walking its generative route at least one target {a mathematical formula}t ′ ∉ Q¯v,wk+1 gets covered.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider a problem instance with a single signal, arbitrary target values while topology and penetration times are as follow:{a mathematical formula}We report the expansions made by the algorithm for increasing cardinalities (value of k) in the following table.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Notice that with {a mathematical formula} Ε ∈ {0.05,0.10,0.25} the number of edges is almost the same when {a mathematical formula}|T| ≤ 16 due to the constraint of connectivity of the graph, leading thus to the same compute times.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It can be observed that, given a value of Ε , the ratios obtained with the dynamic programming algorithm are essentially constant as {a mathematical formula}|T| increases and this constant reduced as Ε reduces.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Surprisingly, after a certain value of {a mathematical formula}|T|, the game values obtained with the branch and bound algorithm are higher than those obtained with the dynamic programming algorithm.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This is because, fixed a value of Ε , as {a mathematical formula}|T| increases, the problem becomes easier and the heuristic used by the branch and bound algorithm performs well finding the best covering routes.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This shows that there is not an algorithm outperforming the other for every combination of parameters {a mathematical formula}|T| and Ε .</a>
