<a href="#0" id="0">Note that the resulting coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ′ may contain any number of coalitions between 1 and {a mathematical formula}k+1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If there is less than one such coalition, the resulting coalition structure will consist of {a mathematical formula}k+1 coalitions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since there are exactly {a mathematical formula}k − 1 negative edges we obtain exactly k coalitions, and since our k-cut is minimal we get a coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare.Case 2: there are less than {a mathematical formula}k − 1 negative edges.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ ={C1 ⁎ ,C2 ⁎ , … ,Ck ⁎ } be a coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The algorithm concludes that the optimal edges to add to G are all the edges that are within a coalition in {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ (line 3), and the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare in G after adding the edges in {a mathematical formula}E+ is {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In order to prove the correctness, we first show that {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare in G, after adding the edges in {a mathematical formula}E+.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Indeed, given a coalition structure P in {a mathematical formula}G ′ , every edge from {a mathematical formula}E+ ′ within a coalition {a mathematical formula}C ∈ P contributes {a mathematical formula}2 − Α to the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The next cut will create a new coalition that will contain the unit edge weight clique, and we will thus get a social welfare that is less than {a mathematical formula}6n2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This coalition structure results in a social welfare greater than {a mathematical formula}2n2R, and thus the ratio between the optimal social welfare and the social welfare of the solution returned by the heuristic is at least {a mathematical formula}R3.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">where {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is a coalition structure maximizing the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">State: A coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Initial state: A coalition structure maximizing the social welfare, {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let {a mathematical formula}Sum − be the contribution to the social welfare of P of edges that will not contribute to the social welfare of {a mathematical formula}P ′ , i.e., the edges between agents that will no longer be members of the same coalition after the deviation.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let {a mathematical formula}Sum+ be the contribution to the social welfare of {a mathematical formula}P ′ of edges that are not contributing to the social welfare of P, i.e., the edges between agents that will become members of the same coalition after the deviation.</a>
