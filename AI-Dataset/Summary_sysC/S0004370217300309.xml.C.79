<a href="#0" id="0">The health state is proposed as a good compromise – it is compact ({a mathematical formula}O(|COMPS|)) and enables answering the basic diagnostic question – what is the probability of a given component to be faulty.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In our context, we use the term quality of a health state H to refer to how much different is H from the offline optimal health state {a mathematical formula}H ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This follows the reasoning that the offline optimal health state is perfect, and any deviation from it constitutes lower quality.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Second, intelligent system repair algorithms do not necessarily repair components in the order assumed by the wasted effort metric (in order of the probabilities in the health state).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While commonly assumed in the academic literature, the assumptions we make in the computation of Equation (4) – known priors and independent failures – can be incorrect in practice, and there has been several prior work on taking into consideration more complex settings where these assumptions do not hold [34], [42].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In contrast, the diagnosis likelihood computation in the second setting was evaluated in practice by prior work, and includes learning a fault prediction model to generate specific priors for every component.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this order, the first health state is calculated based on a subset-minimal diagnosis that had the maximal number of faulty components.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The last health state is calculated based on having all previous diagnoses and a new diagnosis that had the minimal number of faulty components.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In our experiment we set {a mathematical formula}N=440 which is approximately the average number of overall diagnoses found per system and M was not set to a fixed number but rather to the cardinality of the initial candidate diagnosis (the number of faulty components in the initial consistent candidate diagnosis).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The Forward order health state calculation is based on fewer diagnoses (lower convergence rate), however, these diagnoses include all minimal cardinality diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The Random order health state calculation is based on more diagnoses but fewer minimal cardinality diagnoses and the Backward order health state calculation is based on the least amount of minimal cardinality diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Our results provide some support for this rational: in more than 70% of the observations in all the examined Boolean circuits systems, the health state has converged to a Ε -stable value (using the AUC metric) without requiring any diagnosis that is not of minimal cardinality.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Although the proposed online stopping condition is very simple, the results in Table 15, Table 16 show that the resulting values for {a mathematical formula} Δ =0.1 are almost exactly the same as those obtained for health states generated from all diagnoses ({a mathematical formula} Δ =0).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">A key difference is that we do not propose a new DA that returns a single diagnosis, but propose a general approach for aggregating a set of diagnoses that can be applied for a wide range of DAs.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Our approach uses the residual difference to calculate the added value of finding more diagnoses, and presents as an output the health state – the likelihood of each component to be faulty.</a>
