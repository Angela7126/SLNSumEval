<a href="#0" id="0">Although the agent {a mathematical formula} Α i cannot plan using {a mathematical formula} Π i ▷ , as the resulting plan might not be executable in the multi-agent problem {a mathematical formula}M, it can be used for heuristic computation (the projected problem is in fact an abstraction of {a mathematical formula}M).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The most comprehensive definition of privacy for MA-STRIPS planning up to date has been presented in [3], together with discussion of privacy of the distributed multi-agent heuristic search we are building upon in this work.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The privacy in MA-STRIPS based multi-agent planning based on [3] can be formally defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i ∈ A, the private part of its problem {a mathematical formula} Π i is</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Definition 6</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A strong privacy-preserving algorithm is a distributed algorithm wherein no agent {a mathematical formula} Α i can deduce existence of a private fact or an isomorphic (that is differing only in renaming) model of a private action or private part of a public action belonging to some other agent {a mathematical formula} Α j, except for what can already be deduced from the projected problem {a mathematical formula} Π j ▷ and the resulting distributed multi-agent plan {a mathematical formula}{ Π i}i=1n.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The MADLA Search uses two heuristics for each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i, a local projected {a mathematical formula}hLi and a distributed {a mathematical formula}hDi.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The search uses an open list for each of the heuristics {a mathematical formula}OLi,ODi for each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The open list selection function prioritizes expansion of states in the open list {a mathematical formula}ODi respective to the distributed heuristic {a mathematical formula}hDi, if the heuristic estimator of {a mathematical formula}hDi is not in the process of computing an heuristic estimate (i.e.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">waiting for some replies from other agents).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The local heuristic is the classical FF applied to each agent's projected problem {a mathematical formula} Π i ▷ , whereas the distributed variant is a novel privacy-preserving modification of previously published distributed FF [8], [6].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Here, we describe both variants and show what properties important for the MADLA Search are satisfied and how privacy is treated.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In the MADLA Planner, the FF heuristic is used as the local heuristic {a mathematical formula}hLi.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As such it is computed by each agent {a mathematical formula} Α i on its respective i-projected problem {a mathematical formula} Π i ▷ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The i-projected (Definition 4) FF heuristic is computed on a relaxed i-projected problem, formally{a mathematical formula}</a>
