<a href="#0" id="0">The method we apply to obtain these solvers is a portfolio tuning approach ISAC++ which generalizes both tuning of individual solvers as well as combining multiple solvers into one solver portfolio.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a side-effect of our work on MaxSAT, we found a way to improve instance-specific algorithm configuration (ISAC) [28] by combining the original methodology with one of the latest and most efficient algorithm portfolio builders to date.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To apply ISAC++ we also need a parametrized MaxSAT solver that we can tune.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the past three years, SAT-based MaxSAT solvers have become very efficient at solving industrial MaxSAT instances, and perform well on most crafted instances.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Also, with annual MaxSAT Evaluations since 2006, there have been a number of diverse methodologies and solvers proposed.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We first show the performance of ISAC++ on partial MaxSAT instances: a benchmark set of crafted instances, one consisting of industrial instances, and finally a set that contains both crafted and industrial instances.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the second set of experiments we train solvers for MaxSAT (MS), Weighted MaxSAT (WMS), Partial MaxSAT (PMS), and Weighted Partial MaxSAT (WPMS).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In these datasets we will combine instances from the crafted, industrial and random subcategories.</a>
