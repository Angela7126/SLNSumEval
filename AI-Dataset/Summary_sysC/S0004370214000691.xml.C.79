<a href="#0" id="0">We now turn to the analysis of the auctioneer's expected benefit, given her information purchasing and disclosure strategy and the bidders' strategies (captured by their set {a mathematical formula}Rbidder according to which they update the probability distribution {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁎ (X=x)).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If indeed the solution is of the form {a mathematical formula}(Rauc,Rbidder), where {a mathematical formula}Rauc ≠ Rbidder, then the bidders can benefit from deviating to (i.e., calculating {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁎ (X=x) according to) {a mathematical formula}Rbidder ′ =Rauc, since this will result in a bid that equals the bidder's expected valuation of the item in cases where no information is disclosed (whereas when {a mathematical formula}Rbidder is used the bid is either greater or lesser than the bidder's expected valuation of the item).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on Proposition 1, Proposition 2 we can summarize the dependency of the equilibrium solution (and consequently the expected benefit of the auctioneer) in the cost of obtaining the information C. Since, as shown above, an equilibrium solution always exists, then for {a mathematical formula}C=0 the equilibrium is either:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One important thing about Algorithm 1 is that it does not require any knowledge of the problem setting other than the matrix M.{sup:9} Therefore, in order to provide a complete analysis of the equilibrium solutions and the resulting benefit of any of the players as a function of the cost C, one only needs to calculate once the expected benefit of the auctioneer for the {a mathematical formula}2k ⋅ 2k possible strategy combinations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The analysis of the case where bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information is an instance of the case where the auctioneer needs to calculate her expected-benefit-maximizing strategy given the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, as given in Section 3.2, for {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As for the dependency of the auctioneer's expected benefit in C for the case in which the bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option of purchasing the information, here the only possible switch is from {a mathematical formula}Rauc ≠ ∅ to {a mathematical formula}Rauc= ∅ (though this derives only from the auctioneer's optimization considerations rather than stability considerations).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This is due to the fact that if the auctioneer discloses the value x of X then the dominating strategy for each bidder is to bid her expected private value, as before, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} Similarly, when a value is not disclosed, the dominating strategy for the bidders is to bid their expected individual private value, based on their belief of the strategy used by the auctioneer (and consequently the probability they assign to each value {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X when information is not disclosed).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Similarly, the stability conditions for a solution {a mathematical formula}(p,p1,...,pk) require equal expected benefit for the auctioneer if disclosing or not disclosing certain information (or purchasing or not purchasing the information in the first place), whenever a mixed strategy is used, or greater expected benefit for a pure strategy used, i.e.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The analysis given in the previous sections enables the demonstration of the effect of different model parameters (the number of bidders, the cost of purchasing the information and the bidders' private values) over the resulting equilibrium in terms of the equilibrium structure, the different players' expected benefit and the social welfare in our hybrid setting.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It depicts the auctioneer's expected utility as a function of her information disclosing strategy {a mathematical formula}(Rauc) and the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}(Rbidder) by which they place their bids.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The table at the bottom of the figure depicts the auctioneer's expected benefit, the bidders' expected individual benefit and the social welfare in the pure-strategy stable solutions found for each of the settings (other than the {a mathematical formula}(X ⁎ ,X ⁎ ) stable solutions, as the auctioneer and bidders' gain (and consequently the social welfare) in this example is the same for {a mathematical formula}{1,2} as for {2}).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Taking the case where {a mathematical formula}N=5 as an example, the equilibrium strategy is to have the auctioneer purchase the external information if its cost is lower than 22.5 and disclose the true outcome only if it belongs to the set {a mathematical formula}{x2,x3} (which does not change, based on Proposition 1).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We emphasize that despite the fact that the total payment that the auctioneer eventually pays the information-provider is C (for changing the price and purchasing the information), the resulting solution is different than the one obtained when the price is set to {a mathematical formula}C ′ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">From the model's point of view, the main difference between their work and ours is that they consider the case where the private and the common value elements are independent and additive and therefore the bidder's valuation function is the sum of the two, whereas our model assumes the bidders' private valuations to be a general (bidder-dependent) function of the common value.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The calculation of the expected benefit of bidders of type t, weighing the expected benefit for each value that X may obtain according to its occurrence probability, is much simpler compared to the discrete case, as we do not need to concern cases where there is more than one bidder placing the same highest bid:{a mathematical formula} and the expected benefit of a random bidder is given by: {a mathematical formula}ubidders= ∫ t ∈ Tft(t)ubidder(t)dt.</a>
