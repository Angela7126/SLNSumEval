<a href="#0" id="0">A heuristic function {a mathematical formula}h:S ↦ [0, ∞ ) associates to each state s an approximation {a mathematical formula}h(s) of the cost of a path from s to a goal state.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is easy to see that the octile distance heuristic for the initial state is 2 but that the actual distance to the goal is {a mathematical formula}2+22, which is the cost of path {a mathematical formula} Π =(4,2)(3,2)(2,3)(3,4)(4,4).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since {a mathematical formula}tn is the goal state {a mathematical formula}h(tn)=0.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let us denote by {a mathematical formula}h ′ the new heuristic function after running the weighted update Djikstra Algorithm on region L. Note that {a mathematical formula}h=h ′ in {a mathematical formula}S ∖ L.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If the movement phase of a real-time heuristic search algorithm may only increase costs in the search graph, then w-consistency is preserved by the movement phase.Let {a mathematical formula}c ′ denote the cost function after the movement phase.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S be a state.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">State {a mathematical formula}s0 is the initial state and {a mathematical formula}sN=sg.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In addition, note that {a mathematical formula}D=0 implies that the solution found by the algorithm is optimal.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We prove that {a mathematical formula}sn+1=tn+1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We evaluated wLSS-LRTA* with six weight values {a mathematical formula}{1,2,4,8,16,32} and nine lookahead values {a mathematical formula}{1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256}.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In Game maps we observe that when the weight value increases the solution cost decreases, for all tested lookahead values, except for {a mathematical formula}w=32 and lookahead equal to 256.</a>
