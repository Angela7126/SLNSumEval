<a href="#1" id="1">Specifically, TRAMP takes as inputs a set of action models from the source domains and a set of plan traces from the target domain, and outputs action models for the target domain (in this paper we focus on the STRIPS action models).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Second, TRAMP encodes the action models from the source domains to a set of formulas.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Intuitively, we show the framework of TRAMP in bridging source and target domains based on the Web and the plan traces {a mathematical formula}T in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">TRAMP takes as inputs sets of action models from multiple source domains {a mathematical formula}{A1, … ,An}, bridges source and target domains based the Web and the plan traces, and outputs action models {a mathematical formula}A for the target domain.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The first phase is to transfer knowledge from source domains based on plan traces from the target domain.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This formalism is about transferring models from source domains and learning action models in the target domain.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, for each source domain {a mathematical formula}Di, we can encode the action models {a mathematical formula}Ai with a list of formulas {a mathematical formula}Fi.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For each action model set {a mathematical formula}Ai from source domain {a mathematical formula}Di, we encode {a mathematical formula}Ai with a set of formulas {a mathematical formula}Fi as is done by Step 3 of Algorithm 2.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Note that driverlog → depots indicates learning action models of target domain depots via transferring knowledge from source domain driverlog, likewise for other cases.</a>
