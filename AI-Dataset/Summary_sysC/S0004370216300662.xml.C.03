<a href="#4" id="4">An important link between the answer sets of Π and {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ is the following property.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">some repair {a mathematical formula}A ′ was computed.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Intuitively, even if we know {a mathematical formula}I ˆ , we still need to guess a repair {a mathematical formula}A ′ that witnesses {a mathematical formula}I ˆ | Π .</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, the repair answer set candidates I of Π and their respective repairs {a mathematical formula}A ′ are extracted from the computed models.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Certainly, {a mathematical formula}I| Π is a minimal model of the weak reduct{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}O ′ = ∅ , and therefore {a mathematical formula}I| Π is a weak repair answer set of Π .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">(Membership) We can guess a repair {a mathematical formula}A ′ together with an interpretation I and then check whether I is an flp-repair answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 O ′ ,P 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}O ′ = 〈 T,A ′ 〉 .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">From this we get that deciding whether I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}PflpI,O ′ is in {a mathematical formula}co-NP.</a>

<a href="#17" id="17">Since {a mathematical formula}A ′ is a repair, by Definition 26 it must be consistent.</a>

<a href="#28" id="28">Note that every answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ resp.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Hence, {a mathematical formula}I ′ does not exist and I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Thus from Proposition 61, it follows that {a mathematical formula}I ˆ is a compatible set for {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T ∪ A ′ ,P 〉 ; hence {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Hence I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ , and thus a deletion repair answer set of Π .</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">That is, for some {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊆ A, we have that I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T ∪ A ′ ,P 〉 .</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">We know that I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ ∪ Π supp ∪ facts(A), i.e.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">By definition of repair answer sets, some {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊂ A exists, such that {a mathematical formula}I ∈ ASweak( Π ′ ), where {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T,A ′ ,P 〉 .</a>
