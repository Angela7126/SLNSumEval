<a href="#0" id="0">Given an inconsistent knowledge base K, a subset R of K is called a correction subset of K if {a mathematical formula}K ∖ R ⊬ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A correction subset R of K is called a minimal correction subset of K if for any {a mathematical formula}R ′ ⊂ R, {a mathematical formula}K ∖ R ′ ⊢ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let K be an inconsistent knowledge base and{a mathematical formula}GKthe MIS-graph of K. Then a subset R of K is a minimal correction subset of K if and only if R is a minimal Y-dominating set of{a mathematical formula}GK.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that for any minimal correction subset R of an inconsistent knowledge base K, {a mathematical formula}(P,Q) is a valid hard constraint for all {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ (K ∖ R) ∩ ( ⋃ MI(K)) and {a mathematical formula}Q ⊆ R.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">So, there exists at least one minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|Q-dominating set R of {a mathematical formula}GK|H such that {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence, there exists at least one minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|{ Α } ∪ Q-dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK|H.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The first item of this proposition shows that only formulas involved in a minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|Q-dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK|H may be considered as causes of the inconsistency in a knowledge base in the presence of a hard constraint {a mathematical formula}H. This accords with that only formulas involved in minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|Q-dominating sets of {a mathematical formula}GK|H have to bear nonzero responsibilities for the inconsistency of a knowledge base with the constraint in the context of the measure {a mathematical formula}dr(K, Α |H).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Moreover, the set of formulas corresponding to {a mathematical formula}{T Α } ∪ W → is a {a mathematical formula}Y|{ Α }[C]-dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Then there exists at least one minimal {a mathematical formula}Y[C]-dominating set {a mathematical formula}R ′ such that {a mathematical formula}R ′ ⊆ R and {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ R ′ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">On the contrary, it is that {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ R ′ holds for all {a mathematical formula}Y[C]-dominating set {a mathematical formula}R ′ such that {a mathematical formula}R ′ ⊆ R.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The first item of this proposition shows that only formulas involved in a minimal {a mathematical formula}Y[C]-dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK may be considered as causes of the inconsistency in a knowledge base in the presence of a soft constraint {a mathematical formula}C. This accords with that only formulas involved in minimal {a mathematical formula}Y[C]-dominating sets of {a mathematical formula}GK have to bear nonzero responsibilities for the inconsistency of a knowledge base with the constraint in the context of the measure {a mathematical formula}dr(K, Α |C).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">So, there exists at least one minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|Q[C]-dominating set R of {a mathematical formula}GK|H such that {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ R.</a>
