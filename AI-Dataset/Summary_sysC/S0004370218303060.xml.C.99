<a href="#0" id="0">Source instances {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ are indistinguishable for an ontology {a mathematical formula}O and mappings {a mathematical formula}M if, for every CQ q over the global schema, the certain answers to q over {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D) and {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D ′ ) coincide.The associated decision problem for an ontology language {a mathematical formula}O and mapping language {a mathematical formula}M is defined as follows, where {a mathematical formula}O ranges over {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M over {a mathematical formula}M: {an inline-figure} is true if and only if {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ are indistinguishable for {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M. We consider not only the combined complexity of {an inline-figure}, but also its data complexity — that is, the complexity under assumption that {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M are fixed, while only {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ form the input.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that in case of combined complexity the conditions for {a mathematical formula}M imply bounded frontier.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">All cases except Case (a) for combined complexity are applicable to the settings with empty ontology, and the data complexity bounds is applicable to the settings with DL-Lite{a mathematical formula}R ontologies.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As usual, in all cases {an inline-figure} can be replaced with any of the standard complexity classes, such as {an inline-figure}, {an inline-figure} and {an inline-figure}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, in combined complexity, CQ entailment is {an inline-figure}-, {an inline-figure}-, {an inline-figure}-, and {an inline-figure}-complete for full TGDs, linear TDGs, DL-Lite{a mathematical formula}R, and empty ontologies, respectively, so Case (a) of the theorem implies that both {an inline-figure} and {an inline-figure} are in {an inline-figure}, {an inline-figure}, {an inline-figure}, and {an inline-figure}, respectively, for the corresponding settings; next, fact entailment is {an inline-figure}-, {an inline-figure}-, and {an inline-figure}-complete for full TGDs, linear TDGs, and DL-Lite{a mathematical formula}R, respectively, so Case (b) implies that both problems are in {an inline-figure}, {an inline-figure}, and {an inline-figure}, respectively; finally, in data complexity, CQ and fact entailment are {an inline-figure}- and {an inline-figure}-complete for full and linear TDGs, respectively, so the data complexity results imply that {an inline-figure} and {an inline-figure} are in {an inline-figure} and {an inline-figure}, respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To complete the proof for Case (b), we show how, with a minor modification of the previous construction, we can further restrict p to be a fact.It is important to note that {a mathematical formula}D and p we will construct are such that {a mathematical formula}D ⊨ p.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this case the notions of compliance and strong compliance coincide, and therefore the reductions show {an inline-figure}-hardness of {an inline-figure} as well.We start with the definition of the source schema: let it consist of unary relational names {a mathematical formula}Zero, {a mathematical formula}One and {a mathematical formula}Tiledt for each {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T, as well as binary relational names {a mathematical formula}HBiti and {a mathematical formula}VBiti for each i such that {a mathematical formula}n ≥ i ≥ 1.Then, let source instance {a mathematical formula}D consist of the following facts over constants 0, 1, and e:{a mathematical formula}Let now the target schema consists of relational names {a mathematical formula}HValidi and {a mathematical formula}VValidi, with {a mathematical formula}n ≥ i ≥ 1, all with arity 3n.We next construct {a mathematical formula}M. For the sake of readability, we allow for (safe) equalities of variables in the bodies of mappings, which clearly does not add any power to the language and can be eliminated by a polynomial transformation.</a>
