<a href="#0" id="0">Here we show how we can add a number of typically used data mining constraints {a mathematical formula}must – link, {a mathematical formula}cannot – link, and {a mathematical formula}must – link – before as linear constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The objective for agglomerative hierarchical clustering is traditionally specified as a greedy process where clusters that are closest together are merged at each level as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula} where:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To ensure that {a mathematical formula}M is a legal merge function we need to ensure the resultant hierarchy is legal.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Guidance constraints such as {a mathematical formula}must – link, {a mathematical formula}cannot – link, and {a mathematical formula}must – link – before constraints can be used to encode domain knowledge or problem constraints into otherwise unsupervised problems such as hierarchical clustering.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">An advantage to our ILP formulation of hierarchical clustering is that data mining constraints can be added naturally by encoding them as linear constraints, which is straight forward.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">While global {a mathematical formula}cannot – link or {a mathematical formula}must – link constraints have been shown to improve the performance of hierarchical clustering, they were designed for flat clustering and do not take into account the hierarchical nature of a dendrogram.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Another constraint type that was specifically devised for hierarchical clustering is the {a mathematical formula}must – link – before (MLB) constraints [23].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">If {a mathematical formula}Q= ∅ then S is the optimal solution to the original problem in Fig.</a>

<a href="#15" id="15">Our results in Table 3, Table 4 show that our method outperforms standard hierarchical clustering for real world language evolution and fMRI data sets for finding the best hierarchy (matching the ground truth).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The results for our experiment showing the difference between the ILP solutions to overlapping hierarchical clustering and the LP approximation scheme solutions are shown in Fig.</a>
