<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:4} Moreover, assume that the valuation function {a mathematical formula}v ˆ is such that if C is a {a mathematical formula} Σ ˆ -feasible coalition, then its value {a mathematical formula}v ˆ (C) is defined as the sum of the weights of the edges covered by C, i.e., {a mathematical formula}v ˆ (C)= ∑ e ∈ E ˆ ,e ⊆ Cwe.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, in this scenario, the constraints provided by the interaction graph would be immaterial, in the sense that {a mathematical formula}{N ˆ } would be still optimal if the complete interaction graph (i.e., where every pair of agents is connected) were used in place of {a mathematical formula}G ˆ in the definition of the structure {a mathematical formula} Σ ˆ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Indeed, given any coalitional game {a mathematical formula} Γ = 〈 N,v 〉 , by defining {a mathematical formula} ⊥ = 〈 KN 〉 as the valuation structure where {a mathematical formula}KN is the complete interaction graph over the set N of agents, we can immediately check that any coalition {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ N is ⊥ -feasible and that {a mathematical formula}val ⊥ (v,S)=v(S) holds.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given the game {a mathematical formula} Γ = 〈 N,v 〉 ∈ CTW-h(mcn) and {a mathematical formula} Σ = 〈 G,S, Α , Β ,x,y 〉 , we define {a mathematical formula}WCSP( Γ , Σ ) as the weighted CSP instance whose underlying CSP instance is {a mathematical formula}CSP( Γ , Σ ) and where each constraint relation {a mathematical formula}r Γ of kind (C1), which is in fact associated with the rule {a mathematical formula} Γ :{pattern} → value, is equipped with the function {a mathematical formula}wr Γ defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Recall from Section 2.2 that the problem has been reduced to computing a {a mathematical formula} Σ ch-optimal coalition structure for the game {a mathematical formula} 〈 N,vch 〉 , where {a mathematical formula} Σ ch= 〈 GC,C,1,0,0, − ∞ 〉 and where {a mathematical formula}vch is any valuation function such that, for each set of nodes {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ N ∪ C with {a mathematical formula}C ∩ C={ci}, {a mathematical formula}vch(C)= ∑ e ∈ E,e ⊆ Cweci (see Theorem B.4 in Appendix B).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since the values of the form {a mathematical formula}vci ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}vcj ⁎ correspond to valuations of Σ -feasible coalitions, by putting the above ingredients together, we conclude that:{a mathematical formula}In order to conclude the proof, note that the left side of the above equation involves polynomially-many values, and recall that each of them can be computed in polynomial time.</a>
