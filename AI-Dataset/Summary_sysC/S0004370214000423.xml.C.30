<a href="#0" id="0">In the following, {a mathematical formula}T and {a mathematical formula}S respectively refer to the set of tasks and shifts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We refer to this model as MIP model:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Trivial lower and upper bounds for z are respectively the maximum number of overlapping tasks ({a mathematical formula}LB ≠ , the number of variables in the largest AllDifferent constraint) and the number of available shifts.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that a maximum independent set in {a mathematical formula}GI, is not necessarily maximal in {a mathematical formula}GCI.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, using {a mathematical formula}GCI is presumably better than using {a mathematical formula}GI to filter AtMostNValue when difference constraints figure in the model (Proposition 2).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To illustrate the interest of {a mathematical formula}GCI, we now use it on our example, with {a mathematical formula}d(z)={1,2,3}, in Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Because of difference constraints, {a mathematical formula}GCI is sparser than {a mathematical formula}GI (Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, MD is now able to compute a larger independent set, leading to find a better lower bound for z.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For instance, if we consider the independent set {a mathematical formula}{x1,x2,x3} (Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">3b), then {a mathematical formula}R1 and {a mathematical formula}R2 respectively state that the number of values is at least three and that the value 5 can be removed from the variable domains.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the following we respectively note {a mathematical formula}z ⁎ and {a mathematical formula}z ̲ r the optimal objective and the objective lower bound at root node.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Finally, a CP model using a propagator {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 G|F|R 〉 , is noted {a mathematical formula} ↓ AMNV 〈 G|F|R 〉 when used within a top – down minimisation strategy and {a mathematical formula} ↑ AMNV 〈 G|F|R 〉 when used within a bottom – up minimisation strategy.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In order to evaluate the influence of the back-propagation of AMNV on performances, we compare the number of optima proved by CP model with filtering rules {a mathematical formula}R1, {a mathematical formula}R1,2 and {a mathematical formula}R1,3 (Fig.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Note that, we no longer use {a mathematical formula}LB ≠ as an initial lower bound, because it corresponds to the size of the largest AllDifferent constraint.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Given this new model, we compare the number of optima respectively proved by {a mathematical formula} ↑ AMNV 〈 GCI|MD,Rk|R1,3 〉 ⁎ and {a mathematical formula} ↑ AMNV 〈 GCI|MD,Rk|R1,3,4 〉 ⁎ , for different values of k, after a resolution of 5 minutes (Fig.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As justified in Section 3.5, {a mathematical formula}R4 calls the AllDifferent BC filtering algorithm on every independent set.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This means {a mathematical formula}R4 is unfortunately not able to get back the good tradeoff between filtering and runtime of the original model, which has AllDifferent constraints in it.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We now evaluate the interest of branching on {a mathematical formula}breif (Fig.</a>
