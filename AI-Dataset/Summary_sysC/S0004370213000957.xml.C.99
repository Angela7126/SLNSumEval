<a href="#0" id="0">Now all normal logic programs are default theories, which are in turn theories of autoepistemic logic [12].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus as a byproduct, our work yields generalisations of argumentation semantics for a general lattice-based setting, from which the existing semantics for logic programming and argumentation can be derived as special cases.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Among the semantics generalised are conflict-free and admissible sets, and naive, stage, preferred and semi-stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a corollary and another new contribution, this also defines these semantics for default logic and autoepistemic logic [12].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This shows that {a mathematical formula}G Ξ M – the two-valued operator associated to the reduced ADF {a mathematical formula} Ξ M – is in some sense “ complete ” with respect to the result of {a mathematical formula}G Ξ ′ ( ⋅ ,M) – the operator for checking whether M is a two-valued stable model of Ξ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Motivated by naming conventions from logic programming, they decided to call (the lower bound of) the least fixpoint of {a mathematical formula} Γ Ξ the “ well-founded model ” of an ADF.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As our next result shows, their intuition of defining the operator was on the spot – they defined the most precise approximation of the two-valued ADF consequence operator {a mathematical formula}G Ξ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This result yields immediate correspondence of all operator-based semantics of an ADF Ξ with the respective semantics of its standard logic program {a mathematical formula} Π ( Ξ ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let{a mathematical formula} Ξ =(S,L,Cin)be an abstract dialectical framework and{a mathematical formula} Π ( Ξ )its standard logic program.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then Ξ and{a mathematical formula} Π ( Ξ )coincide on all semantics based on their approximation operators.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In particular, {a mathematical formula}G Ξ =T Π ( Ξ ) and an ADF and its standard logic program also agree on all semantics derived from the ultimate approximation of their two-valued operators.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Consistent pairs (those {a mathematical formula}(S,P) with {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ P) obviously are three-valued labellings, where exactly all arguments in S are in.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As our first observation, we note that the approximating operator that Definition 3.1 assigns to the ADF of an AF Θ is also a special case of an operator: it is the canonical approximation of {a mathematical formula}U Θ , the operator assigning to a set S of arguments all the arguments from A which are not attacked by S.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In the remainder, we will denote the four-valued approximation operator of an argumentation framework Θ by {a mathematical formula}F Θ ; we formally define {a mathematical formula}F Θ ′ =defG Ξ ( Θ ) ′ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">It follows by definition that the characteristic operator {a mathematical formula}F Θ of an AF is its own stable operator: For any argumentation framework Θ , we have{a mathematical formula}SF Θ =F Θ .Let {a mathematical formula} Θ =(A,R) and {a mathematical formula}X,Y ⊆ A.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We have to show {a mathematical formula}SF Θ ′ (X,Y)=F Θ ′ (X,Y).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Now {a mathematical formula}SF Θ ′ (X,Y)=lfp(F Θ ′ ( ⋅ ,Y))=lfp(U Θ (Y))=U Θ (Y)=F Θ ′ (X,Y).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In the following section, it will become clear that this is not the case and the characteristic operator of an argumentation framework is well-designed: we show next how the major semantics of argumentation frameworks can be redefined in terms of fixpoints of the characteristic operator.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">As a first illustration of universality of the characteristic operator of an AF, we recapitulate a result that is well-known in the argumentation community: the operator {a mathematical formula}U Θ (which is at the heart of {a mathematical formula}F Θ ) can emulate the characteristic function {a mathematical formula}F Θ of an argumentation framework: {a mathematical formula}F Θ is the same as twofold application of {a mathematical formula}U Θ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">There are several works in the literature that redefine argumentation semantics in terms of (pre-/post-)fixpoints of the two operators {a mathematical formula}F Θ and {a mathematical formula}U Θ [1], [23].</a>
