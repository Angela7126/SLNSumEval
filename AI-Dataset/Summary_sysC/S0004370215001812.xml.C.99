<a href="#0" id="0">In that setting, the question is whether an imputation for {a mathematical formula} Π ¯ exists which is stable — formally, this amounts to use {a mathematical formula}{ Π ¯} in place of {a mathematical formula}CS(G) in Equation (1).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Accordingly, the above definition of the coalition structure core can be viewed as the natural generalization of the proposal by Aumann and Dreze to the case where players might organize themselves in any arbitrary coalition structure taken from {a mathematical formula}CS(G).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Results for CS-CoS, CS-Core-NonEmptiness, CS-LCV{sup: − }, CS-LCV{sup:+}, and CS-LCV on {a mathematical formula}CK(R) are either already stated in Section 4.1 (membership results) or derive from them via Lemma 4.11 and the assumption that {a mathematical formula}mcn ≾ eR (hardness results).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Similarly, hardness results for the problems on superadditive games follow by Lemma 4.11, by the results in Section 4.2, and by the assumption that {a mathematical formula}mcn ≾ eR.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, the proof of the membership of CS-Core-Membership in {a mathematical formula}co-NP over the class {a mathematical formula}CK(R) (and, hence, over {a mathematical formula}CKsa(R)) is a simple adaptation of the result derived in the setting where all coalitions are allowed to form [9] — see the proof of Theorem 4.1.Then, consider the remaining results to be shown on the class {a mathematical formula}CKsa(R).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To address this problem, actually with {a mathematical formula} Ε <0 (as the case {a mathematical formula} Ε =0 reduces to CS-Core-NonEmptiness), we recall the characterization of Lemma 3.9: the least coalition structure core value of Γ is at most Ε if, and only if, (i){a mathematical formula}|CS-opt( Γ )|=1, and (ii){a mathematical formula} Π ∈ CS-opt( Γ ) implies {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ CS-opt( Γ Π ,- Ε ) and {a mathematical formula}CS-core( Γ Π ,- Ε ) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, we need just to show that (i) and (ii) can be checked in polynomial time over lines.Indeed, by Claim 6.2, the optimal social welfare can be computed in polynomial time, in fact, together with a feasible coalition structure {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ CS-opt( Γ ).</a>
