<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula} It is immediate to check that everything discussed above with respect to the original set of AICs also applies to its normalized counterpart, i.e., intuitively, these constraints represent the same knowledge and the sets of repairs and weak repairs remain unchanged.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The two intended repairs are thus {a mathematical formula}{+a,+c} and {a mathematical formula}{+b}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let us investigate what the different AFT-style semantics give in this case.Consider{a mathematical formula}Here, it holds that{a mathematical formula} Hence, {a mathematical formula}T Η (U0)=U0 and {a mathematical formula}U0 is the {a mathematical formula}T Η -Kripke – Kleene fixpoint.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, we claim that there are no unfoundedness refinements of {a mathematical formula}U0, and hence that {a mathematical formula}U0 is also the {a mathematical formula}T Η -well-founded fixpoint.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To see that our claim indeed holds, notice that any unfoundedness refinement of {a mathematical formula}U0 should consist of making a subset U of {a mathematical formula}{+a,+b,+c} false, in such a way that for each {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ U, {a mathematical formula}T Η (U0[U:f])( Α )=f.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Assume {a mathematical formula}+a ∈ U.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In order for {a mathematical formula}T Η (U0[U:f])(+a) to be false +b must be t in {a mathematical formula}U0[U:f] (otherwise the body of the rule defining +a is unknown or true).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">That is not possible, hence {a mathematical formula}+a ∉ U.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">From a similar argument, we find that {a mathematical formula}+b ∉ U and {a mathematical formula}+c ∉ U.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Trivially, the two intended repairs are more precise than the well-founded fixpoint.Now, let us check whether {a mathematical formula}U:={+a,+c} is a stable repair.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We now show that all AFT-style semantics are nicely invariant under shifting.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}T Η , and hence also{a mathematical formula}T Η , commutes with shifting, i.e., for each set{a mathematical formula}S ⊆ At:{a mathematical formula}The clue to proving this proposition is the fact that for each action Α ,{a mathematical formula} Then, the result easily follows from the fact that {a mathematical formula}T Η has been defined entirely based on the {a mathematical formula}supp function.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In our translation of AICs to logic programs, namely in Theorem 7.6, we assume that {a mathematical formula}DB= ∅ and that the only update actions that occur in heads of rules are positive, i.e., of the form +a.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In turn, the two last computations can be done in polynomial time: they require evaluating each literal in the body of each rule from Η with head Α or {a mathematical formula} Α D and computing its truth value under the database updated by {a mathematical formula}U.</a>
