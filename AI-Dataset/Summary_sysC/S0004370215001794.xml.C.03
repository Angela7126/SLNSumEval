<a href="#0" id="0">In scientific computing and in realistic graphic animation, simulation – that is, step-by-step calculation of the complete trajectory of a physical system – is one of the most common and important modes of calculation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In artificial intelligence (AI) programs, simulation has been used for physical reasoning [28], [48], robotics [45], motion tracking [61], and planning [67].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In cognitive psychology, likewise, simulation in a much broader sense has been proposed as the primary mechanism underlying physical reasoning, reasoning about other minds, language comprehension, and many other cognitive functions [43].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For many reasoning tasks, simulation is unquestionably a powerful tool and an intuitively appealing one; however, it is important to recognize its limitations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Here, we analyze the scope and limits of simulation as a technique of automated physical reasoning for general AI.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this simulation the initial state at a given time t is specified in terms of the height of the ball, {a mathematical formula}x(t), and its velocity {a mathematical formula}v(t), both measured upward.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consider, for instance, the simulation of a pendulum on a string.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In some cases, reasoning about a physical system can be carried out more reliably and effectively using extra-physical information.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Carrying out a physical simulation is generally only possible if the geometric and physical characteristics of the initial condition are known precisely.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, the simulation algorithm requires that the initial conditions of the scenario be fully specified relative to a given level of description.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Given a probability distribution over a space of physical situations, a program generates some large collection of specific situations following the distribution; it carries out a simulation based on each of these; and then it considers these behaviors as a random sample of the possible behaviors.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">One could perhaps simulate that as well, but obviously the reasoning needed to figure out that this simulation is relevant and to set up the simulation is much more complex than the simulation itself.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Suppose that we can avoid that problem of probabilistic simulation and directly generate a simulation of a photon that starts at Polaris and travels in a straight line to the eye.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This involves the problem of interpolating a simulation with constraints at multiple time points, discussed in the next section.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Rather the simulation must represent only the time points when something interesting happens.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">An example of a case where simulation runs into the frame problem is as follows.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">If the wrong time increment is used in simulating solid objects, the simulation can predict that one object passes through another.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">If there is no human in the loop, then it would be very desirable for the physical reasoning system to be able to detect these kinds of problems by itself.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">If the simulation is the only reasoning mechanism, this cannot be done.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Simulation is effective for automated physical reasoning when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of scales involved, both temporal and spatial, is not extreme.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Probabilistic simulation can be effective when a plausible probability distribution can be posited, and when it is easy to generate a random sample of instances satisfying the known constraints.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">For simulation to serve as a general solution to the problem of physical reasoning, in either human or automated form, all would need to be solved.</a>
