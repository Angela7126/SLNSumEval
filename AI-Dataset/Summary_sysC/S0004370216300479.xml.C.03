<a href="#0" id="0">We say that an action theory {a mathematical formula}D is bounded by b if every executable situation is bounded by b, formally:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, the theory is bounded by {a mathematical formula}k+1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}D be a basic action theory.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We say that a basic action theory is effect bounded if every fluent {a mathematical formula}F ∈ F is effect bounded.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Any action other than {a mathematical formula}move(x,y) leaves O unchanged.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">One way to do this is to add an action {a mathematical formula}replace(x,y), i.e.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let us comment on some aspects of {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp:</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Observe that Z is not further substituted in {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence the object o will appear back only if introduced by the action {a mathematical formula}arrive(o).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">While {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp allows for quantification over objects that persist across situations, the expressiveness of bounded action theories often makes its use avoidable.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We now show that verifying {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp properties against bounded action theories is decidable.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If Φ is {a mathematical formula}F(t → ,s), we have that, by definition, {a mathematical formula}t → can only contain object terms, so {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ is {a mathematical formula}F(t → ,s).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Now, for each {a mathematical formula} Φ A, let {a mathematical formula} Φ A ′ be a formula containing no action terms, such that {a mathematical formula}Dca ⊨ ∀ ( Φ A ≡ Φ A ′ ).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">By induction hypothesis, such a {a mathematical formula} Φ A ′ exists.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Finally, let {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ = ⋁ A ∈ A ∃ y → A. Φ A ′ (x → ,y → A,s).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In other words {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ is a domain-independent formula [1].</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">That is, for {a mathematical formula} Φ = Φ FA, {a mathematical formula}FIM(s ′ )= Φ y → /o → IM(s).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">By Theorem 5, we can focus, without loss of generality, on a variant of {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp where action terms do not occur.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Suppose that {a mathematical formula}T1,q1,v1 ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The other direction is proven symmetrically.For {a mathematical formula} Φ =live(x → ) ∧ 〈 − 〉 Φ ′ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We can now extend the result to the whole {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">This is a standard result that holds also for {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">As to requirement 2, let {a mathematical formula}q ′ ∈ Q be such that {a mathematical formula}q → Fq ′ .</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">As shown in the proof of Theorem 15, there exists an executable situation s such that {a mathematical formula}IF(q)=IM(s).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">In particular, for the base case of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ a FO formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ , since {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ is action-term-free and domain-independent, one can apply Theorem 9.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Assume that there exists {a mathematical formula}q1 ′ ∈ Q such that {a mathematical formula}q1 → q1 ′ .</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Now, let {a mathematical formula} Φ A ′ (x → ) be the domain-independent version of {a mathematical formula} Φ A(x → ).</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Now observe that, since the action theory is bounded, so is the extension of each fluent F at {a mathematical formula}q1 and {a mathematical formula}q1 ′ .</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Let {a mathematical formula}D be the action theory.</a>
