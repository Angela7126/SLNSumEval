<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, in case of program {a mathematical formula} Π ′ one can define an external atom {a mathematical formula}&nodes[](Y), which returns all nodes Y in the graph, and add a rule {a mathematical formula}d(Y) ← &nodes[](Y) to the program to compute the domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The domain atom {a mathematical formula}d(Y) can then be added to the bodies of all rules which use the external domain (in {a mathematical formula} Π ′ this is rule {a mathematical formula}r3 ′ ) in order to make the program strongly safe and allow for evaluating it using the traditional methods.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}r ∈ grndC ′ ( Π ) and suppose {a mathematical formula}A ⊭ r, i.e., {a mathematical formula}A ⊭ H(r) but {a mathematical formula}A ⊨ B(r).As we have seen in the proof of Theorem 16, all lde-safety relevant positive external atoms in r are represented with degree 0 in the program computed by Algorithm GroundHEXNaive.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As such external atoms are handled equivalently by our optimized algorithm, they are also represented in {a mathematical formula} Π pg.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that this holds also for positive external atoms which are not lde-safety relevant.Suppose r contains an external atom which is not lde-safety relevant and which is not represented in {a mathematical formula} Π pg.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then there is a ‘ first ’ such external atom {a mathematical formula}&g[v](u) in {a mathematical formula}B(r), i.e., its input list only contains constants which (1) appear in ordinary atoms, (2) appear in lde-safety relevant external atoms, or (3) were already constants in the program.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In all three cases, the input auxiliary rule for {a mathematical formula}&g[v](u) is instantiated for this v because its body atoms are potentially true (ordinary atoms appear also in {a mathematical formula}B(r) and are potentially true, otherwise r would not have been added to {a mathematical formula} Π g; external atoms are all not lde-safety relevant and are potentially true since they are represented with degree 0), i.e., {a mathematical formula}ginp&g(v) appears in the program.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Moreover, the respective external atom guessing rule is instantiated for v and u because all its body atoms are potentially true (with the same argument as for input auxiliary rules).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, {a mathematical formula}&g[v](u) would be represented in {a mathematical formula} Π p with some degree >0, and thus also in {a mathematical formula} Π pg and {a mathematical formula} Π g.Thus, all positive external atoms are represented in {a mathematical formula} Π pg.</a>
