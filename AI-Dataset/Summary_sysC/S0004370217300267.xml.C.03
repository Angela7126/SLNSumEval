<a href="#24" id="24">The approach described in this section shows how as a Lakatos Game is executed, AIF structures are created which, when translated to {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+, produce abstract argumentation frameworks which under grounded semantics have as acceptable arguments all and only those elements which correspond to the mathematical theory accepted by the participants at a given stage of the game.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Finally, the updates to the grounded extension of the argumentation framework, {a mathematical formula}GELG, are computed and compared with the status of the theory defined by the locution rules of LG.</a>

<a href="#37" id="37">The purpose of HybridLemmaInc is to introduce a new conjecture, {a mathematical formula}c ′ , but it is not HybridLemmaInc itself that does this, but rather the Conjecture move which is required to follow it.</a>
