<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, if the question is to find the real solutions of a well-constrained system of equations, then it will generally implement a solution existence (and often uniqueness) theorem, e.g., Miranda, Brouwer or interval Newton [13], that guarantees that the solution box contains a (unique) real solution; on the other hand, if the question is to compute the solution set of a conjunction of inequality constraints, then it will usually implement a universal solution test, which guarantees that every real assignment in the solution box is a solution of the NCSP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Property {a mathematical formula}(P1) allows defining in each {a mathematical formula}([x],[q]) ∈ S a function {a mathematical formula} Κ ([x],[q]):[x] → [q] that associates the unique command {a mathematical formula}q= Κ ([x],[q])(x) with a given position x (i.e., the solution of the inverse kinematic problem locally defined inside {a mathematical formula}([x],[q])).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One delicate point in managing neighborhood comes from the fact that some pose or command parameters are often angles whose domains are restricted to a single period, e.g., {a mathematical formula}[ − Π , Π ]; the periodicity of these parameters has to be taken into account: Boxes are neighbors when they share a common point modulo 2 Π on their periodic dimensions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Applying this heuristic, practical, post-process, the number of obtained CSNCs, reported at Line “ {a mathematical formula}# CSNCsfiltered ” in Table 1, reaches the theoretically known number of aspects in the cases of the robots we considered.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Line “ {a mathematical formula}# boxesfiltered ” in Table 1 shows the total number of boxes after the filtering heuristic.</a>
