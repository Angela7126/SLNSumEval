<a href="#0" id="0">Given the ample impact of power in people's decisions, which may be observed in scenarios ranging from simple social interactions [45] to social dilemma situations [3], [78], the ability to understand power-based social dynamics and emulate them in cognitive agents is of fundamental importance for improving such agents' interactive capabilities [14].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Emerson's theory is perfectly adequate for the aforementioned purposes, but for an agent society in which different types of social relations have different effects and the social structure itself is continuously changing, a semantically stronger framework of social power is needed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From the perspective of French and Raven, the status/conferral dynamics resulting from the use of power consist of different effects derived from social-power-based interactions that affect the social power structure (e.g., increased liking or decreased perceived expertise) and, therefore, the subsequent potential power that individuals possess in the society and can use to exert influence (claim status in subsequent interactions).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The factors of the second type are the beliefs ({a mathematical formula}BeT,p) that evolve from the agent's interactions in the environment that also affect the different social powers (e.g., a belief regarding another agent's tendency to provide a certain reward).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A value of 0 means that, although identified as a potential influence, the force neither favors nor discourages the performance of C. To determine the actor's overall influence on the target's decision resulting from all potential social-power forces, we assume a simple resultant force approach in accordance with the working definitions of social power and influence (see Section 3.4).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the definition of the agent decision mechanism, we introduced the influence force derived from social power as a combination of all of the diverse social powers that are identified as active in a given situation, each arising from a specific social power base.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To this end, and despite the fact that the dynamics of certain factors (e.g., changes in social group membership) are beyond the scope of this work, we also detail several aspects that are directly related to each base of social power (e.g., a belief regarding an agent's tendency to coerce).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A legitimate norm social power (n) is a function of the importance of the relevant social group to the target ({a mathematical formula}Importanceg), the intrinsic dutifulness ({a mathematical formula}DutifulnessMT) felt by the target toward the social group, the group norm conformity recognized by the target ({a mathematical formula}ConfT,g) and a norm-related bias ({a mathematical formula}Bias(n)) derived from the agent's association and experience with the social group.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Based on this initial analysis, the agent decides whether a strategic interaction is required to emphasize his/her social power and improve the chances of a successful influence interaction.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If no influence interaction is anticipated but one occurs nonetheless, then the agent begins by assessing the bases of social power identified as relevant to that interaction.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Some of the key changes that social power processes entail in a typical agent architecture are related to the agent's belief structure and the attributes that characterize the agent's individual behavior.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The final attribute that is intimately related to the individual behavior of an agent is the agent's Power Preferences.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Although in general, individual preferences influence most actions to some extent, in considering this attribute, we model only those preferences that are related to the agent's utilization (from the actor's perspective) of social power (e.g., preferences regarding the use of either coercive or referent social power bases).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The final output of this process is the set of all social powers identified as relevant to a given interaction and the resultant influence force that arises from them with regard to an influence interaction.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Similarly, even in the context of a non-strategic interaction (a simple request to perform a given task without emphasis on any factor related to a social power base), if the target recognizes the higher expert social power of the actor (confers a higher expert social power to the actor), then the actor's claim is simply met.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The basic information needed for planning an interaction is obtained from the “ Power Situational Analysis ” process through an assessment of the potential social-power forces that are active in a given context (using the mental model of the target).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In this section, we present the results of the user study conducted to collect evidence regarding the capability of users to understand the social power dynamics underlying the agents' behaviors as generated by the developed social power model as well as the impact that SAPIENT agents can have on a user's experience with a virtual environment.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">As such, although the participants did not know what was being assessed nor, in many instances, could pinpoint a specific difference between the conditions, it is clear that the agents implemented using the SAPIENT model created the perception of strong social power dynamics, resulting in stronger and more positive effects in terms of the interactive experience.</a>
