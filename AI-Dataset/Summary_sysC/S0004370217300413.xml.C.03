<a href="#6" id="6">We say that Φ and Ψ are equivalent if for all Ρ we have {a mathematical formula} Ρ ⊨ Φ if and only if {a mathematical formula} Ρ ⊨ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Ltl is satisfiable if there is some run satisfying Φ ; moreover, it is satisfied by a Kripke structure K if it is satisfied by all its initial runs, that is, if, and only if, it is satisfied by all {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ runs(K).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Formally, given a set Φ of Boolean variables, the syntax of CTL is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Φ .</a>

<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula} Φ i ⊆ Φ is the (finite) set of variables controlled by {a mathematical formula}mi;</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let {a mathematical formula} Φ ={x,y} and consider the srml arena{a mathematical formula} where agent i controls x and agent j controls y and {a mathematical formula}mi and {a mathematical formula}mj are further specified as in Fig.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Thus, let {a mathematical formula}K=(S,S0,R, Π ) with {a mathematical formula} Π :S → V( Φ ).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Define the srml module {a mathematical formula}mK for the Kripke structure K as in Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N, the formula {a mathematical formula} Γ i is the goal of player i, represented as a temporal logic formula; in what follows, we consider both LTL and CTL as possible goal languages.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">A run (an infinite word), denoted by {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( Σ → ), for LTL RMGs;</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In order to simplify notation, whenever the game is clear from the context, we will write {a mathematical formula} Σ → ⊨ Φ for both {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( Σ → ) ⊨ Φ , if {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Ltl, and {a mathematical formula}K Σ → ⊨ Φ , if {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Ctl.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">If a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i is consistent with module {a mathematical formula}mi, we simply say that {a mathematical formula} Σ i is a strategy for{a mathematical formula}mi.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Given an srml arena {a mathematical formula}A=(N, Φ ,m1, … ,mn), we say that a strategy profile {a mathematical formula} Σ → =( Σ 1, … , Σ n) is consistent with A if each {a mathematical formula} Σ i is consistent with {a mathematical formula}mi.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">By contrast strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i ′ does not comply with {a mathematical formula}mi.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">More surprisingly, {a mathematical formula} Φ stability does hold not even hold in every run that is sustained by a Nash equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The module {a mathematical formula}m( Σ i) then controls the variables {a mathematical formula} Φ i ′ = Φ i ∪ Qi.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">That the behaviour of {a mathematical formula}m( Σ i) is exactly as the behaviour of {a mathematical formula} Σ i is obvious from the construction.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Then, once {a mathematical formula} Σ → is specified in srml, the following result immediately follows from Lemma 2.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">{a mathematical formula}Realizabilityfor LTL RMGs is 2EXPTIME-complete.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">An LTL game is won by player 0 if {a mathematical formula}w ⊨ Φ ; otherwise player 1 wins.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">( ⟹ ) First, suppose that player 0 has a winning strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ c in the given LTL game {a mathematical formula}(GLTL, Φ ,v0), which can be assumed to be of finite memory.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Then, because {a mathematical formula} Σ 0 is a finite-memory strategy, it straightforwardly defines a strategy in the LTL game for Φ .This part of the proof shows that the problem is 2EXPTIME-hard for 3-player games.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">It then follows that player i has a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i such that for all {a mathematical formula} Σ → − i it holds that {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( Σ → − i, Σ i) ⊨ Φ in G if and only if i has a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i ⁎ such that for all {a mathematical formula} Σ → − i ⁎ it holds that {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( Σ → − i ⁎ , Σ i ⁎ ) ⊨ Φ in {a mathematical formula}G2.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">First, use Lemma 6 and Corollary 7 to construct an LTL formula {a mathematical formula}Th(A Σ → ) that characterises {a mathematical formula} Σ → .</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">It is not difficult to show that, for all runs Ρ that satisfy {a mathematical formula}Th(A Σ → ), it is the case that {a mathematical formula} Ρ | Φ = Ρ ( Σ → ).</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">First, let us write {a mathematical formula}Th(m( Σ j)) for the LTL formula that characterises {a mathematical formula} Σ j, with {a mathematical formula}j ∈ N.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">This strategy can be used to build a strategy profile {a mathematical formula} Σ m that is not a Nash equilibrium if, and only if, Φ is satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">{a mathematical formula}Now, consider a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ m such that {a mathematical formula}q ∉ Τ (q0).</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Then, it follows that {a mathematical formula} Σ m ⊭ Φ ∧ q.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">If Φ is satisfiable then m has a beneficial deviation: switch to a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ m ′ that builds a model for Φ and such that {a mathematical formula}q ∈ Τ (q0).</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">However, if Φ is not satisfiable, then no strategy for m will satisfy {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ q, and hence {a mathematical formula} Σ m would be a Nash equilibrium in such a case.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">For membership in 2EXPTIME, we instantiate the E-Nash problem (described below) with {a mathematical formula} Φ = ⊤ .</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Let {a mathematical formula} Σ → =( Σ 1, Σ 2) be an arbitrary strategy profile and assume first that {a mathematical formula} Σ → ⊨ ¬ Φ .</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Now, suppose that {a mathematical formula} Σ → ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Then, if {a mathematical formula} Σ → ⊨ ¬r player {a mathematical formula}m1 will have a beneficial deviation.</a>

<a href="#43" id="43">{a mathematical formula}N ′ =N ∪ {n+1,n+2} and {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ = Φ ∪ {xn+1,xn+2},</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">{a mathematical formula} Γ i ′ = ⋀ j ∈ NTh(mj) ∧ Γ i,</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Then, if a player i has a beneficial deviation in {a mathematical formula}G ′ and not in G it must be by switching to a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ i ′ that is not consistent with A.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Note, in particular, that if a player i did not have its goal {a mathematical formula} Γ i ′ satisfied in {a mathematical formula}G ′ by {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( Σ → , Σ n+1, Σ n+2), then such a strategy profile does not satisfy {a mathematical formula} Γ i either – because the LTL formula {a mathematical formula} ⋀ j ∈ NTh(mj) is necessarily satisfied.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">Then, {a mathematical formula} Ρ ( Σ → ) ⊭ Γ i.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">The goal {a mathematical formula} Γ move of this player in the CTL RMG is defined to be {a mathematical formula} Γ move= ⊤ .</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">For {a mathematical formula}ag2 we let the strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ 2 be any strategy such that it chooses the initialisation command where {a mathematical formula}p= ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">A STRIPS game is then given by a structure{a mathematical formula} where A is a multi-agent STRIPS arena, and {a mathematical formula} Γ i is the temporal logic goal of player i; as with RMGs, we might consider LTL or CTL goals.</a>
