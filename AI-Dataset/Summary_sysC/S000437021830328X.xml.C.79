<a href="#0" id="0">Coalition C can even use a strategy that simultaneously achieves another result in addition to Φ :{a mathematical formula} In our logical system we use an equivalent form of the above principle that is stated using only implication:{a mathematical formula} We call this property epistemic determinicity principle.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that a coalition is always finite due to our assumption that the set of all agents {a mathematical formula}A is finite.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For any epistemic state {a mathematical formula}w ∈ W of a transition system {a mathematical formula}(W,{ ∼ a}a ∈ A,V,M, Π ) and any formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Φ , let relation {a mathematical formula}w ⊩ Φ be defined as follows</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Indeed, assumption {a mathematical formula}w → sw ′ , by Definition 6, implies that {a mathematical formula}w → s1w ′ and {a mathematical formula}w → s2w ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By Definition 7, it suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}w ″ ⊩ Φ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Indeed {a mathematical formula}w ∼ ∅ w ″ by Definition 3.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}w ″ ⊩ Φ by assumption {a mathematical formula}w ⊩ K ∅ Φ and Definition 7.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Although the proof follows the outline of the proof of Lemma 26 for modality {a mathematical formula}KC, it is significantly more involved because of the need to show that a transition from a parent node to a child node satisfies the constraints of the vote aggregation mechanism from Definition 13.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, {a mathematical formula}sa0 ′ =( ⊤ ,w ′ ) by definition (20).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">At the same time, {a mathematical formula}sa0 ′ =( Φ ,w ′ ) by the second assumption of the claim.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">strong completenessFor any (possibly infinite) set of formulae{a mathematical formula}X ⊆ Φ and any formula{a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Φ , if{a mathematical formula}X ⊬ Φ , then there is an epistemic state w of an epistemic transition system such that{a mathematical formula}w ⊩ Χ for each formula{a mathematical formula} Χ ∈ Xand{a mathematical formula}w ⊮ Φ .</a>
