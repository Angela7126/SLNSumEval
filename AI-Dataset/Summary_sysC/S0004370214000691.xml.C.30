<a href="#0" id="0">Second, it enables immediate determination of whether or not the external information is purchased by the auctioneer for any given setting – the information is necessarily purchased if there exists R such that {a mathematical formula}U(R, ∅ )>u( ∅ , ∅ ), and not purchased otherwise.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is because there is always an equilibrium (according to Corollary 1) and unless {a mathematical formula}( ∅ , ∅ ) is stable, the equilibrium is different than {a mathematical formula}( ∅ , ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, it suggests that at the point of switching from purchasing to not purchasing the information, the auctioneer's expected benefit necessarily does not decrease by switching to not purchasing the information (which is equivalent to not having the information provider in the market in the first place).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Based on Proposition 1, Proposition 2 we can summarize the dependency of the equilibrium solution (and consequently the expected benefit of the auctioneer) in the cost of obtaining the information C. Since, as shown above, an equilibrium solution always exists, then for {a mathematical formula}C=0 the equilibrium is either:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since any equilibrium that holds in our model holds for a continuous interval of C values, the bidder's expected benefit as a function of C can be described as a step function, according to which the bidders' expected benefit changes only in C values for which the equilibrium changes.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The expected social welfare, which is the sum of the auctioneer's and bidders' expected benefit, exhibits a behavior similar to the auctioneer's expected benefit except that with any equilibrium transition the overall sum can either increase or decrease by some constant {a mathematical formula}C ′ , due to the change in the bidders' expected benefit.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The analysis of the case where bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information is an instance of the case where the auctioneer needs to calculate her expected-benefit-maximizing strategy given the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, as given in Section 3.2, for {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this case, the auctioneer will simply choose the subset {a mathematical formula}Rauc associated with the maximum value according to the first column in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since all elements in the first column, except for {a mathematical formula}( ∅ , ∅ ), decrease equally due to the increase in the value C, the auctioneer will keep on using this strategy for any setting with greater C values until her expected benefit is less than {a mathematical formula}u( ∅ , ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The stability of the solution according to which the auctioneer does not purchase the information in the model with aware bidders is achieved only when {a mathematical formula}u( ∅ , ∅ ) is greater than or equal to any other element in the first column of the solution space matrix (see Table 1).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This is also, however, the condition for switching to not purchasing the information in the model with unaware bidders.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">According to Theorem 2, if {a mathematical formula}( ∅ , ∅ ) is a stable solution then it is necessarily also the equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Consequently, if the strategy of the auctioneer is {a mathematical formula}Rauc, and the bidders' strategy is to bid according to {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, then the auctioneer's expected benefit from the auction itself (i.e., excluding the payment C), {a mathematical formula}u(Rauc,Rbidder), is:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}uauc(x) is calculated according to (6).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Consequently {a mathematical formula}U(Rauc,Rbidder)=u(Rauc,Rbidder) − p ⁎ C.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The figure depicts the auctioneer's expected benefit as a function of the information cost, for the setting given in the following table:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">5 depicts the equilibrium's expected benefit for the auctioneer and bidders and the expected social welfare as a function of the cost of the external information, for different numbers of bidders.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Nevertheless, since the cost at which the transition between purchasing the information to not purchasing it also increases as n increases, it is possible that for some costs, with {a mathematical formula}n1 bidders the information is not purchased in equilibrium and with {a mathematical formula}n2>n1 the information is purchased in equilibrium, yielding to the auctioneer an expected benefit lower than the one obtained for {a mathematical formula}n1.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">5 for cost {a mathematical formula}C=23.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In this case the expected benefit of the auctioneer with 5 bidders is greater than her expected benefit with {a mathematical formula}n=6.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Taking the case of {a mathematical formula}N=6 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">5, if the cost of purchasing the information is {a mathematical formula}C<6 then the auctioneer's expected benefit is greater than the one resulting from not having the option to purchase the information in the first place.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Still, even with that setting, for a cost {a mathematical formula}6 ≤ C<25 the auctioneer is better off not having the option to purchase the information.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Here, for any cost {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ C ≤ 4.05 the equilibrium in the bidders' awareness case is {a mathematical formula}({x1,x2,x3},{x1,x2,x3}) and its expected benefit to the auctioneer is greater than in the case where bidders are unaware of the option of purchasing the information.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Interestingly, for {a mathematical formula}4.05<C ≤ 4.3 the equilibrium in the awareness-based variant becomes {a mathematical formula}({x1,x2,x3,x5},{x1,x2,x3,x5}), resulting in a change in the auctioneer's preference towards preferring bidder's unawareness.</a>
