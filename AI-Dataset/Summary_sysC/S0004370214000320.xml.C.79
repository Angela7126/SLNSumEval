<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we seek to explore a novel algorithm framework, called TRAMP, to learn action models with limited training data in a target domain, via transferring as much of the available information from other domains (called source domains) as possible to help the learning task, assuming action models in source domains can be transferred to the target domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">TRAMP takes as inputs sets of action models from multiple source domains {a mathematical formula}{A1, … ,An}, bridges source and target domains based the Web and the plan traces, and outputs action models {a mathematical formula}A for the target domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the source is not “ that ” similar to the target, the weights of the mapped knowledge will be low according to the weight learning procedure (i.e., Algorithm 4), since the mapped knowledge will not “ that ” strongly satisfy the input plan traces.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We define error rates of our learning algorithm as the difference between our learned action models and the action models (or the “ ground truth ” ) created by domain experts (assuming domain models created by domain experts are reliable or executable).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Specifically, both TRAMP and ARMS exploit the same sets of constraints when encoding action models in Step 3 of Algorithm 1; TRAMP calculates weights of formulas (i.e., F1 – F3, which will be filtered based on threshold Δ ) to statistically best explain plan traces, while ARMS exploited frequent set mining (using a presented threshold) to learn weights of constraints; it is reasonable that the accuracy of TRAMP is close to ARMS when tuning a proper threshold, i.e., {a mathematical formula} Δ =0.5 in the experiment.</a>
