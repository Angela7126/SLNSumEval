<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:1} As we will see these results are due to the fact that the problems of credulous and skeptical acceptance for the base semantics are located on different levels of the polynomial hierarchy (in NP for credulous acceptance, but {a mathematical formula} Π 2P-hard for skeptical acceptance [27]).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ X, {a mathematical formula}S − is the set of arguments {a mathematical formula}{x: ∃ y ∈ S s.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">(x,y) ∈ A} and, similarly, {a mathematical formula}S+ contains {a mathematical formula}{x: ∃ y ∈ S s.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An (extension-based) semantics, Σ , is said to be unique status if for every AF{a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A 〉 it holds that {a mathematical formula}|E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )|=1, otherwise the semantics is said to be multiple status.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For Σ a unique status semantics, {a mathematical formula}E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 ) denotes the unique set of arguments in {a mathematical formula}E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 ), i.e {a mathematical formula}E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )={E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )} for unique status semantics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">An argument, {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X is acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}S ⊆ X if for any {a mathematical formula}y ∈ X for which {a mathematical formula}(y,x) ∈ A there is some {a mathematical formula}z ∈ S such that {a mathematical formula}(z,y) ∈ A.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The characteristic function, {a mathematical formula}F:2X → 2X, reports the set of arguments that are acceptable to a given set.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given a framework {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A 〉 , a base semantics Σ , an argument {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X and a set {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ X.We prove (i) by providing an {a mathematical formula}NPV algorithm for disproving x to be in the ideal extension.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then x is accepted by the computation where {a mathematical formula}Ssa= ⋂ E ∈ E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )E. This thus solves the complementary problem to {a mathematical formula}ca Σ idl as desired.We get (ii) by a simple adaptation of the above algorithm: instead of testing {a mathematical formula}x ∉ A one tests whether {a mathematical formula}S ⊈ A, which disproves the set S to be an ideal set.For (iii) we use another adaptation of the above algorithm, now one tests for {a mathematical formula}A= ∅ , which proves that {a mathematical formula}E Σ ie= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In less formal terms, this assumption states that every simple cycle in {a mathematical formula}H(V) uses at least two distinct values.</a>
