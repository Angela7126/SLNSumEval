<a href="#0" id="0">In this context, given a distribution network and the predicted future demand and generation profiles, AI planning is used to decide which operations to apply to the power system, at what times, to maintain the voltage within the desired bounds.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Section 5 we present the necessary fundamentals of power systems, with emphasis on the voltage control problem for distribution systems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This leads to the identification of a second dimension to our problem, and motivates the need for attachment to an external solver which is then described in Section 6.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An important difference between this and the benchmark domains considered so far in planning, is that the calculation of the numeric quantities requires the solution of a set of non-linear (in this case, power flow) equations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These problems are interesting for planning if the control actions take a significant amount of time relative to variations generated by the background processes (or, equivalently, if the control system is slow to react to changes in the background processes), or if the BTMP appears in the context of additional goals that require discrete causal reasoning alongside the management of the trajectory constraints.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The power of the abstraction is that the planner knows that it is applying an action that changes the network state, and can access the values of mixed metric expressions that are affected by the solver, but does not require a declarative description of the effects of those changes on the network.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Without infinity analysis, once the action can be applied in the TRPG, the end point would have to be applied at multiple time points (to obtain the accumulated effects of multiple applications of the increase effect) and these would be separated only by Ε since the relaxation would allow the same action end point to be applied repeatedly once its preconditions were satisfied ( Ε separation is required, because the TRPG must advance time by a minimum amount before constructing the next layer of the graph).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As a result, if the duration of the relaxed plan in the TRPG is d, the TRPG would require approximately {a mathematical formula}d/ Ε layers, which will usually be many thousands, making the TRPG impractical to construct.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">While this narrowing of the TRPG at each TIF layer might provide additional heuristic information for some problems, by leading to longer relaxed plans, it does not help for BTMPs in which there are no mixed metric constraints in the preconditions of actions, since in this case the reachable actions are not influenced by the uncontrollable variables and the relaxed plan therefore cannot be affected either.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This arises in the AC voltage control problem in the following way.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since the over all constraint, in the constraint-check action, refers to the Network voltage, the computation of {a mathematical formula}P[v/ Α ] (Definition 11) exploits the external solver to determine the actual value of the Network voltage for the particular p-level and q-level load and generation settings.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In particular, zoning will increase variance by reducing the number of consumers connected to the supply sources in any zone.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For this reason we test the robustness of the generated plan, starting from a known load profile and applying the same plan to the network with random variations of the load profile.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The total violation {a mathematical formula}Vtot of a plan with respect to a load profile is measured as the sum of the violations of voltage level at each busbar:{a mathematical formula} where times is the set of timepoints in the execution trace resulting from applying the plan, or HTC approach, over the 24-hour period, and:{a mathematical formula} The quantity {a mathematical formula}Vtk is the total violation at time t and busbar k. The quantity {a mathematical formula}Vt,k is the voltage at time t at busbar k. As is standard in power systems, all voltage measurements are given in per unit volts, meaning that the voltages at a busbar are scaled relative to the nominal target voltage at that busbar.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In the planning approach the same plan is applied to the set of 500 instances for each of the 12 load profiles.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This is why the number of tap changes remains constant and the standard deviation is zero.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As shown in the table, the planning approach never violates the constraints when there is perfect knowledge of the load-series.</a>
