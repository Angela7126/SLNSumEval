<a href="#0" id="0">We propose the structural interface algorithm for efficient inference in DBNs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It exploits conditional independence and repeated structure in the network in a way similar to the interface algorithm [3].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On each of the three domains, both of the interface algorithms scale linear with the number of time steps while this is not the case for inference in the unrolled network.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The structural interface algorithm, which exploits local structure, successfully performs inference on all of the networks while this is not the case for the standard interface algorithm.</a>
