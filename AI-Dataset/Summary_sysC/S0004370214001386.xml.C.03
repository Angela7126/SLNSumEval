<a href="#0" id="0">Given a graph with branching factor b, there are {a mathematical formula}O(b) possible moves for any single agent and thus the branching factor for an A* search is {a mathematical formula}O(bk) which is exponential in the number of agents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The maximum possible branching factor for k agents is {a mathematical formula}bpotential=bbasek.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For each agent {a mathematical formula}ai we assume that no other agent exists and calculate its optimal individual path cost from all states in the state space to {a mathematical formula}goali; this is usually done by a reverse search from the goal.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider {a mathematical formula}A*+ID on our example problem in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This solution is now validated with the solution of agent {a mathematical formula}a3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The root of the ICT is {a mathematical formula}[opt1,...,optk], where {a mathematical formula}opti is the optimal individual path cost for agent {a mathematical formula}ai, i.e.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An ICT node {a mathematical formula}[C1,..,Ck] is a goal if there is a complete non-conflicting solution such that the cost of the individual path for {a mathematical formula}ai is exactly {a mathematical formula}Ci.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The total cost of a node is {a mathematical formula}C1+ … +Ck.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The task of the low level is to find a non-conflicting complete solution such that the cost of the individual path of agent {a mathematical formula}ai is exactly {a mathematical formula}Ci.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A consistent path for agent {a mathematical formula}ai is a path that satisfies all its constraints.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The path for agent {a mathematical formula}ai must be consistent with the constraints of {a mathematical formula}ai.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Node N in the CT is a goal node when {a mathematical formula}N.solution is valid, i.e., the set of paths for all agents has no conflicts.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The low-level search is given an agent, {a mathematical formula}ai, and the set of constraints associated with {a mathematical formula}ai.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">It performs a search in the underlying graph to find an optimal path for agent {a mathematical formula}ai that satisfies all its constraints while completely ignoring the other agents.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The cost of a solution in {a mathematical formula}CV(N) is the sum of the costs of the individual agents.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The total number of time steps summed over all agents is {a mathematical formula}C ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Thus, an upper bound on Y, the number of CT nodes that CBS must expand, is {a mathematical formula}2|V|×C ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">CBS performs a high-level search in the CT and then a low-level search in the underlying graph and expands a total of {a mathematical formula}Y¯ low-level states.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">All these nodes are expanded with {a mathematical formula}f=6.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We denote an execution of CBS with cost function Φ as {a mathematical formula}CBS Φ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Suppose that a conflict was found between agents {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}a2, and these two agents were chosen to be merged.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">{a mathematical formula}CM[i,j] accumulates the number of conflicts between agents {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}aj seen thus far by MA-CBS.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Consider the set of constraints associated with (meta-) agents {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}aj before the merge.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Assume that agents {a mathematical formula}ai and {a mathematical formula}aj are to be merged into a new meta agent {a mathematical formula}a{i,j} and that {a mathematical formula}ai has the external constraint {a mathematical formula}(ai,v,t).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Assume a 3-agent problem where in the optimal solution agent {a mathematical formula}a3 must go through vertex v at time step t. Calling MA-CBS to solve this problem creates the root CT node.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Assume that in the path chosen for each agent in the root CT node both agents {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}a2 are assigned vertex v at time step t. Next, MA-CBS branches according to the conflict {a mathematical formula}(a1,a2,v,t).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Two new CT nodes are generated {a mathematical formula}{N1,N2}.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">If we allow the constraints imposed on agents {a mathematical formula}a1 and {a mathematical formula}a2 to apply to agent {a mathematical formula}a3 we will block the optimal solution in both {a mathematical formula}N1 and {a mathematical formula}N2 which are the only two nodes in OPEN.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The conflicting agents will be merged as {a mathematical formula}B=0.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The root contains a conflict {a mathematical formula}(a1,a2,A,1) and a new CT node {a mathematical formula}N1 is created with the constraint {a mathematical formula}(a1,A,1).</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Therefore another CT node {a mathematical formula}N2 is created with the constraint {a mathematical formula}(a2,A,1) but it contains the conflict {a mathematical formula}(a2,a3,B,1).</a>
