<a href="#0" id="0">Both contributions together result in relational linear programming, best summarized as{a mathematical formula} The user describes a relational problem in a high-level, relational LP modeling language and — given a logical knowledge base (LogKB) encoding some individuals or rather data — the system automatically compiles a symmetry-reduced LP that in turn can be solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Actually, the block of {an inline-figure} statements can be merged after suitable renaming of the involved logical variables.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume a single {a mathematical formula}{an inline-figure}{Y{an inline-figure} Φ ′ }{ Ψ } string for some par-expression Ψ of length n, which does not include any other {an inline-figure} statement.Now, by our induction base, Ψ itself would result in a finite set of ground arithmetic expressions as long as its free variables have been bound.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This, however, is the case since by definition all free variables of Ψ are bound by the LogKB, by the query {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ of the {an inline-figure} statement or by the logical query Φ of the leading {an inline-figure} statement.</a>
