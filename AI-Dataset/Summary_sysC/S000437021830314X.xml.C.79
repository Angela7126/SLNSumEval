<a href="#0" id="0">In general, a basic action theory {a mathematical formula}D is a set of sentences consisting of (free variables understood as universally quantified from the outside):</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The function g from {a mathematical formula}N to {a mathematical formula}R is assumed to not conflict with f. (That is, the logical terms are distinct.)</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, we define the definite integral of t over all real values of x by the following:{a mathematical formula} The main result for this logical abbreviation is the following:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Without going into full details, assume the provision of domain-specific sensing axioms, also part of the basic action theory {a mathematical formula}D. For example,{a mathematical formula} formalizes the sensing outcome for an action to check whether f has value 1 in situation s. Here SF is a special {a mathematical formula}L-predicate, similar to Poss.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Next, the term {a mathematical formula}l(a,s) is intended to denote the likelihood of action a occurring in situation s. Among other things, l can be used to model noisy sensors.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Basically, if {a mathematical formula}sonar(z) is the sonar sensing action with z being the value read, we specify a likelihood axiom describing its error profile as follows:{a mathematical formula} This stipulates that the difference between a nonnegative reading of z and the true value h is normally distributed with a variance of {a mathematical formula} Σ 2 and mean of Μ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let us contrast (2) with the following initial axiom for p:{a mathematical formula} Then, letting a basic action theory include the sentence:{a mathematical formula} means that the robot believes h is uniformly distributed on {a mathematical formula}{2,3} or on {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,10} without being able to say which.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Step (a) expands P. In step (b), owing to the fact that sensing actions do not change fluent values (by our first assumption tailored to Bayesian conditioning), {a mathematical formula} Φ [do(a, Ι )] is equivalent to {a mathematical formula} Φ [ Ι ].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">(The main reason for introducing the formula {a mathematical formula}f=x is to allow us to identify those situations where f takes the value x which are all to be multiplied by the error likelihood for observing z when the true value is x.)</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">More precisely, the belief term in the first entailment simplifies to:{a mathematical formula} Note that we have replaced {a mathematical formula}(h ≤ 9)[do(sonar(5),S0)] by {a mathematical formula}(h ≤ 9)[ Ι ] since {a mathematical formula}sonar(z) does not affect h. From (a), we get{a mathematical formula} We know from (9) that those initial situations where {a mathematical formula}h ≤ 2 have p values 0.</a>
