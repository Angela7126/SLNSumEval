<a href="#1" id="1">Given an unsatisfiable SAT formula Φ , an unsatisfiable core{a mathematical formula} Φ C is a subset of clauses {a mathematical formula} Φ C ⊆ Φ that is also unsatisfiable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section, we present the WPM3 complete algorithm for the MaxSAT problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Like Eva and OLL, it is a core-guided algorithm that only handles Cardinality constraints.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In addition, WPM3 is able to increase the lower bound to higher values at each iteration and obtain also upper bounds and assignments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The basic schema of WPM3 consists in, given an input WPMS formula Φ , testing the satisfiability of a sequence of SAT instances {a mathematical formula} Φ k where {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ k ≤ ∑ w( Φ ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Each SAT instance {a mathematical formula} Φ k encodes whether there is an assignment to Φ with a cost ≤ k.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Notice that SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k<cost( Φ ) are unsatisfiable, while the others are satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">WPM3 increases the lower bound by testing unsatisfiable {a mathematical formula} Φ k SAT instances.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Following the same idea of the transformation in Example 3 of Section 3, we can consider that WPM3 maintains in AM the information to build a WPMS formula {a mathematical formula} Φ k such that {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ )=cost( Φ k+ 〈 □ ,k 〉 ).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For each {a mathematical formula} 〈 Aj,kj,wj 〉 in AM, the clause {a mathematical formula}a ‾ j of Example 4 corresponds to {a mathematical formula} 〈 o ‾ kj,wj 〉 according to the notation of Example 3.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The formula {a mathematical formula} Φ k, sent to the SAT solver to check if {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ k)=0, does not include the clauses {a mathematical formula}o ‾ i|i>kj and the corresponding Cardinality constraints since they are satisfied for all assignments to {a mathematical formula}bi variables that satisfy the clauses {a mathematical formula}o ‾ kj (i.e.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}a ‾ j).</a>
