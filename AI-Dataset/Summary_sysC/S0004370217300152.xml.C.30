<a href="#12" id="12">The worst-case minimax regret (WmMR) of a query {a mathematical formula}q ∈ Q is:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Pq denotes the set of all possible answers to the query q.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In this paper, we adopt an incremental elicitation procedure based on minimax regret in order to acquire the most relevant information about the Choquet capacity representing the DM's preferences (capacity v taking the role of parameter Θ for the Choquet integral {a mathematical formula}Cv).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since sets belonging to {a mathematical formula}A(x,y) are the only ones that appear in the objective function of PL1, then by applying Proposition 1 to set {a mathematical formula}A=A(x,y), we know that {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) can be solved by considering only monotonicity constraints involving variables {a mathematical formula}vA, {a mathematical formula}A ∈ A(x,y).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Therefore, we can compute {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) by solving the following simpler linear program:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We introduce now a query generation strategy determining the most informative query involving a binary alternative and a constant profile.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Our query generation strategy uses the WmMR criterion presented in Definition 7.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Since at each iteration step the DM is asked to compare a binary alternative 1A0 to a constant profile {a mathematical formula} Λ =( Λ , … , Λ ), an optimal query for this criterion is defined by a pair {a mathematical formula}(A ⊆ N, Λ ∈ [lA,uA]) that reduces the minimax regret in the worst-case as much as possible.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">More precisely, to find such a pair, for all sets {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, we have to determine the following value:{a mathematical formula} and then, we arbitrary select a set {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ in {a mathematical formula}arg ⁡ minA ⊆ N ⁡ WmMR((A, Λ A), Θ P); thus, the pair {a mathematical formula}(A ⁎ , Λ A ⁎ ) defines an optimal query for the WmMR criterion.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Recall that each generated query involves two fictitious alternatives carefully chosen: one binary alternative of type {a mathematical formula}1A0, {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, and one constant utility profile of type {a mathematical formula} Λ =( Λ , … , Λ ), {a mathematical formula} Λ ∈ [lA,uA].</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Hence, as a baseline for comparison, we consider the query generation strategy that consists in choosing, at each iteration step of the elicitation procedure, both set {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N and {a mathematical formula} Λ ∈ [lA,uA] at random.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In this framework, an alternative x is necessarily at least as good as an alternative y when {a mathematical formula}Cv(x) ≥ Cv(y) for all admissible capacities {a mathematical formula}v ∈ Θ P, that is when {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P)<0.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">In order to save queries, we might assume that x is preferred to y when {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) ≤ Δ where {a mathematical formula} Δ ≥ 0 is a (small) tolerance threshold.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">We will first generate preference queries and use minimax regret computations to determine a top alternative with a max regret lower than threshold Δ .</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Then, this alternative is deleted and the selection process is iterated on the remaining set of alternatives with the same tolerance threshold.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The selected alternative in this second stage will be the second best alternative in the ranking and so forth (see Algorithm 2).</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">For any pair of alternatives x and y such that x is ranked before y in the final ranking, we have{a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) ≤ Δ where{a mathematical formula}Pis the set of all preference statements collected to construct the whole ranking.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Let {a mathematical formula}P ′ be the set of preference statements collected until the insertion of x in the ranking.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Since y is ranked below x, we know that {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P ′ ) ≤ Δ .</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}P ′ ⊆ P, then we have {a mathematical formula} Θ P ′ ⊇ Θ P and (refer to Equation (2)) therefore {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) ≤ PMR(x,y, Θ P ′ ) ≤ Δ .</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">When assessing a utility score {a mathematical formula}f Θ (x) for each alternative {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X, it is natural to sort alternatives with respect to their score by considering thresholds.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">More precisely, the method proposed in this section consists in assigning alternative {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X to category {a mathematical formula}K ℓ if {a mathematical formula}f Θ (x) ∈ [ Α ℓ , Α ℓ − 1].</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">As utility function {a mathematical formula}f Θ is not known precisely, we need to define some measure of regret for possible assignments.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">More precisely, given parameter Θ , we will assign x to the category {a mathematical formula}K ℓ such that {a mathematical formula}f Θ (x) ∈ [ Α ℓ , Α ℓ − 1].</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">The max regret (MR) of {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X with respect to category {a mathematical formula}K ℓ is:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">We now define the notion of minimax regret and the MR-optimal category associated to an alternative {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X:</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Indeed, we have {a mathematical formula} Θ P ′ ⊆ Θ P for any set of preference statements {a mathematical formula}P ′ ⊇ P; then, for any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X and any {a mathematical formula} ℓ ∈ {1, … ,q}, we have:{a mathematical formula} and so, the maximum minimax regret cannot increase by adding new preference statements; in the subsection devoted to numerical tests, we will see that, in practice, it strictly decreases when queries are chosen in a reasoned way.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">The worst-case maximum minimax regret (WMmMR) of q is:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Pq denotes the set of all possible answers to query q.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">For any alternative{a mathematical formula}x ∈ X, it holds{a mathematical formula}where{a mathematical formula}fx ⊤ =max Θ ∈ Θ P ⁡ f Θ (x)and{a mathematical formula}fx ⊥ =min Θ ∈ Θ P ⁡ f Θ (x).</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">For any solution {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X:{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">This means that, in order to determine the MR-optimal category for x, it is sufficient to compute {a mathematical formula}max Θ ∈ Θ P ⁡ f Θ (x) and {a mathematical formula}min Θ ∈ Θ P ⁡ f Θ (x), and then compute {a mathematical formula}MR(x,K ℓ , Θ P) according to Proposition 8 for each category {a mathematical formula}K ℓ , {a mathematical formula} ℓ ∈ {1, … ,q}.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Recall that CQ relies on queries involving binary alternatives {a mathematical formula}1A0 and constant utility profiles {a mathematical formula} Λ =( Λ , … , Λ ).</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">Hence, for a baseline comparison, we consider the random generation strategy where both {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N and {a mathematical formula} Λ ∈ [lA,uA] are selected at random at each iteration step of the elicitation procedure.</a>
