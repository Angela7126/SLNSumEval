<a href="#0" id="0">A (disjunctive logic) program P is a finite set of disjunctive rules (over Σ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A program P is called normal (resp.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">positive) if each {a mathematical formula}r ∈ P is normal (resp.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">positive); P is constraint-free, if P contains no constraints.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Notation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It is convenient to introduce further notation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For any rule r, we denote by {a mathematical formula}At(r)=H(r) ∪ B+(r) ∪ B − (r) the set of all atoms occurring in r, and for any program P, we let {a mathematical formula}At(P)= ⋃ r ∈ PAt(r).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We assume as usual that by default {a mathematical formula} Σ =At(P), i.e., the signature is the one generated by the considered program P.</a>

<a href="#10" id="10">In terms of the GL-reduct, we have {a mathematical formula}(X,Y) ⊨ P for a program P iff {a mathematical formula}Y ⊨ P and {a mathematical formula}X ⊨ PY[54].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In particular, as {a mathematical formula}AS(P)=MM(P) for any positive program P, we have {a mathematical formula}EQ(P)={(M,M)|M ∈ MM(P)} in this case.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Note that for any program P, its epistemic transformation {a mathematical formula}P Κ is a positive program.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Models of {a mathematical formula}P Κ are defined in terms of a fixpoint operator in [49], with the property that for positive programs, according to Theorem 2.9 in [49], minimal fixpoints coincide with minimal models of the program.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, for any program P, minimal fixpoints of {a mathematical formula}P Κ coincide with answer sets of {a mathematical formula}P Κ .</a>

<a href="#18" id="18">The set of all semi-stable models of P is denoted by {a mathematical formula}SST(P), i.e., {a mathematical formula}SST(P)={S ∩ Σ Κ |S ∈ mc(AS(P Κ ))}.</a>

<a href="#25" id="25">The set of semi-equilibrium models of P is denoted by {a mathematical formula}SEQ(P).</a>

<a href="#27" id="27">{a mathematical formula}PHTLet P be a program over Σ .</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Then its epistemic HT-transformation {a mathematical formula}PHT is defined as the union of {a mathematical formula}P Κ with the set of rules:{a mathematical formula} for {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Σ , respectively for every rule {a mathematical formula}r ∈ P of the form (1).</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">In what follows, we establish a semantic characterization of the {a mathematical formula}SEQ-models relative to a splitting set as those {a mathematical formula}SEQ-models of the program that extend {a mathematical formula}SEQ-models of the bottom part.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Proposition 10</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Let S be a splitting set of a program P. If{a mathematical formula}(X,Y) ∈ SEQS(P), then{a mathematical formula}(X,Y)|S ∈ SEQ(bS(P)).</a>

<a href="#34" id="34">Like the ordinary {a mathematical formula}SEQ-models, also the split {a mathematical formula}SEQ-models coincide with the answer sets of a program if some answer set exists.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Proposition 13</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">For every constraint-free program P and splitting set S of P, it holds that{a mathematical formula}SEQ(PS) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Proposition 15</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">For every splitting sequence S of a constraint-free program P, it holds that{a mathematical formula}SEQ(PS) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Theorem 7</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Let S be a splitting set of a program P without cross-constraints.</a>

<a href="#44" id="44">Formally, for a given Σ let {a mathematical formula} Σ E= Σ ∪ {Ea|a ∈ Σ }, where {a mathematical formula}Ea intuitively means that there is evidence that a is true.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Given a program P, its evidential transformation {a mathematical formula}PE consists of the following rules:</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">3.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">{a mathematical formula}Ea ← a, for each {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Σ ,</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">Also the program in Example 22 has a single P-stable (and L-stable) model in which all atoms are undefined, while c is true under {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model semantics.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">Similarly, the program{a mathematical formula} has a single P-stable (and thus L-stable) model in which all atoms are undefined; if we add the rules {a mathematical formula}d ← a, {a mathematical formula}d ← b, and {a mathematical formula}d ← c to P, the new program cautiously entails under both semi-stable and {a mathematical formula}SEQ-model semantics that d is true, but not under L-stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">Proof of Proposition 7</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">Let P be a program over Σ .</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">If P has a model M, then {a mathematical formula}(M,M) is an HT-model of P. Therefore {a mathematical formula}HT Κ (P) ≠ ∅ , which implies {a mathematical formula}MM(HT Κ (P)) ≠ ∅ , and thus {a mathematical formula}mc(MM(HT Κ (P))) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">We conclude that {a mathematical formula}SEQ(P) ≠ ∅ , i.e., P has a semi-equilibrium model.</a>
