<a href="#1" id="1">Credibility object – credibility baseLet {a mathematical formula}A be a set of agent identifiers and {a mathematical formula}P,Q,S ∈ A.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A credibility object is a pair {a mathematical formula}[P>Q,S] which represents that agent P is strictly more credible than Q, and the agent S is the information source of the credibility element{a mathematical formula}P>Q.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A credibility base is a finite set {a mathematical formula}C of credibility objects.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[A>C,K], K is the source of {a mathematical formula}A>C, and K represents the reliability of {a mathematical formula}A>C.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, the function {a mathematical formula}rel(C) returns the set of agent identifiers that are sources of credibility elements in {a mathematical formula}C, i.e., {a mathematical formula}rel(C)={S:[P>Q,S] ∈ C}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This function will be used to determine the set of agent identifiers that represents the reliability of an argument.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As we will show below, an argument will be composed of a set of credibility objects, and to obtain its reliability the sources of those objects will be considered.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Each credibility element that can be inferred from a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C will have an argument associated that supports it, and such argument will contain the reliability information for that inference.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This reliability information will be used for comparing arguments supporting contradictory conclusions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">An argument is a minimal set of credibility objects as defined next.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Definition 2</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">ArgumentLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base, {a mathematical formula}A be a set of agents, and {a mathematical formula}B,C ∈ A where {a mathematical formula}B ≠ C, an argument {a mathematical formula}X for the conclusion {a mathematical formula}B>C from {a mathematical formula}C is a set of credibility objects {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ C, such that {a mathematical formula}B>C ∈ cl(X) and there is no {a mathematical formula}X ′ ⊂ X holding that {a mathematical formula}B>C ∈ cl(X ′ ).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The set of all arguments that can be built from {a mathematical formula}C will be denoted as {a mathematical formula}ArgsC.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">If {a mathematical formula}X is an argument for the conclusion {a mathematical formula}B>C, sometimes we will use the notation {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,B>C 〉 .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Definition 3</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">SubargumentLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base and {a mathematical formula}X,Z ∈ ArgsC, then {a mathematical formula}Z is a subargument of {a mathematical formula}X if and only if {a mathematical formula}Z ⊆ X.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Proof</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">If {a mathematical formula}(Y,X) ∈ TAttsC then by Definition 5 there is a subargument {a mathematical formula}Z of {a mathematical formula}X such that {a mathematical formula}Y and {a mathematical formula}Z have contradictory conclusions.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Then, given that any argument is trivially a subargument of itself, by Definition 5 it holds that {a mathematical formula}(Z,Y) ∈ TAttsC.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Recall that given an argument {a mathematical formula}X the set {a mathematical formula}rel(X) represents the reliability of {a mathematical formula}X and contains all the agent identifiers that are sources of the credibility objects in {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">For instance, as shown for the arguments from Example 3, {a mathematical formula}rel(A1)={K,J}, {a mathematical formula}rel(A2)={K,H} and {a mathematical formula}rel(A3)={J}.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Example 4</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Consider the credibility base of our running example:{a mathematical formula} In Example 3, we have shown how from {a mathematical formula}C2 it is possible to build the arguments {a mathematical formula}A2,A3, and {a mathematical formula}A1, and Fig.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">An AFRA is expressed as a set of arguments and a set of attacks, where an attack is a pair {a mathematical formula}(A,T) such that {a mathematical formula}A is an argument and {a mathematical formula}T is either an argument or an attack [4].</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">To instantiate an AFRA, we will use arguments and attacks obtained from a credibility base, and then we will analyze which elements are accepted from this framework.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Thus, each credibility base will characterize a particular AFRA which will be called its associated AFRA.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Definition 10</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Defeat in associated AFRALet {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC,AttsC 〉 be the associated AFRA of a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, {a mathematical formula} Α , Β ∈ AttsC and {a mathematical formula}X ∈ ArgsC ∪ AttsC:</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Definition 11</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Conflict-freeness, acceptability, admissibilityLet {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC,AttsC 〉 be the associated AFRA of a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ ArgsC ∪ AttsC, and {a mathematical formula}X ∈ ArgsC ∪ AttsC.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Then:</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">{a mathematical formula}X is acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">S iff for all {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ AttsC such that Α defeats {a mathematical formula}X, there exists {a mathematical formula} Β ∈ S such that Β defeats Α .</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Definition 12</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Preferred ExtensionLet {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC,AttsC 〉 be the associated AFRA of a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C and {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ ArgsC ∪ AttsC.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">The set S is a preferred extension of {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC,AttsC 〉 iff it is a maximal (w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">⊆ ) admissible set.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Definition 13</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Extension of a credibility baseLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base and E a preferred extension of its associated AFRA {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC,AttsC 〉 .</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">We will say that E is an extension of a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C iff for any argument {a mathematical formula}X ∈ ArgsC if every subargument {a mathematical formula}Z ⊂ X is in E then {a mathematical formula}X is in E.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Definition 14</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Justified credibilitiesLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base and E an extension of {a mathematical formula}C, then the set of justified credibilities of E is {a mathematical formula}JE={A>B: 〈 X,A>B 〉 ∈ E}.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">If {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ JE, by Definition 14 it holds that there is an argument {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 in E, thus {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 in {a mathematical formula}ArgsC.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">By Definition 2 we have that {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ C and {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ cl(X).</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Then {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ cl(C).</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">If {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ JE then, by Definition 14, there is an argument {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 in E. By Definition 2 it holds that {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ C and {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ cl(X).</a>
