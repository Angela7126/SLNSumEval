<a href="#0" id="0">We introduce MiningZinc, a declarative framework for constraint-based data mining.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">MiningZinc consists of two key components: a language component and an execution mechanism.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, the MiningZinc language allows for high-level and natural modeling of mining problems, so that MiningZinc models are similar to the mathematical definitions used in the literature.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">a finite set of constraints {a mathematical formula}C.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Modeling a mining problem in MiningZinc follows the same methodology as modeling a constraint program: one has to express a problem in terms of variables with a domain, and constraints over these variables; for example, a set variable with a minimum frequency constraint over data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Listing 8 contains some examples of constraint-based mining constraints that can be added to the frequent itemset mining model in Listing 2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Line 6, Items = cover_inv(cover(Items,TDB),TDB), represents the popular closure constraint {a mathematical formula}I= Ψ D( Φ D(I)).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This closure constraint, together with a minimum frequency constraint, represents the closed itemset mining problem [18].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">the set of FlatZinc constraints over {a mathematical formula}V1, … ,Vn that specify the problem this algorithm can solve (multiple sets can be given in case of multiple equivalent formulations);</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Example 8</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Past work showed that the execution of the frequent itemset mining task is more efficient in some CP systems if a look-ahead constraint is added.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let {a mathematical formula}C2={minfreq_redundant(I,D,V)} represent this look-ahead constraint (see Section 2.4).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This constraint set is entailed by the set of constraints {a mathematical formula}C1={A=cover(I,D),B=card(A),V ≤ B}.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Then for the model of Example 3 (depicted by {a mathematical formula}CM) we have the following rewrite:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">a set of constraints {a mathematical formula}C1;</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Recall that all specialized algorithms are registered with a predicate definition {a mathematical formula}p(±1V1, … ,±nVn) and a set of constraints C that define the problem being solved by this algorithm.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Note that not all variables in C need to be a parameter of the predicate; there can be auxiliary variables.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Example 13</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Assume we wish to solve the earlier model{a mathematical formula} where the available algorithms are the LCM and FPGrowth specialized itemset mining algorithms, the maxsup and frequency specialized algorithms and the Gecode generic CP system (in that order).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Then these are the ranked execution plans: {a mathematical formula} In the above we assume that LCM and FPGrowth are aware of the redundant constraint minfreq_redundant.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">If not, there would be variants of each of the specialized and hybrid strategies with redundant constraints too (they would be ranked below their non-redundant equivalent as they would have more constraints for the CP system).</a>
