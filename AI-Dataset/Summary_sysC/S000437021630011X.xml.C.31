<a href="#1" id="1">Obviously, the question is how the same can be done for loops.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is where quantification over natural numbers comes in.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consider the following while loop</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given a program P and a set {a mathematical formula}X → of program variables including all variables used in P, we define inductively the set of axioms for P and {a mathematical formula}X → , written {a mathematical formula} Π PX → , as follows:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Before we consider more interesting examples, we illustrate our construction of {a mathematical formula} Π PX → using two simple programs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given a program P and a set {a mathematical formula}X → of program variables including all variables used in P, we again use {a mathematical formula} Π PX → to denote the set of axioms for P and {a mathematical formula}X → :</a>
