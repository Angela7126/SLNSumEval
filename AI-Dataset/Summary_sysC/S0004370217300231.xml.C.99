<a href="#0" id="0">(22) the partition function can be computed from the full-inside mass at the top level ({a mathematical formula}d=1){a mathematical formula} With the similar derivation the partition function can also be computed from the full-outside mass at the bottom level ({a mathematical formula}d=D){a mathematical formula} In fact, we will prove a more general way to compute Z in Appendix B{a mathematical formula} for any {a mathematical formula}t ∈ [1,T] and {a mathematical formula}d ∈ [2,D − 1].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this section we consider the general case when {a mathematical formula} Ζ =( Θ ,h), where Θ is the visible set labels, and h the hidden set.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since our HSCRF is also an exponential model it shares the same computation required for general CRFs (Eqs.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, in general, the computation of each building block is multiplied by an identity function that enforces the consistency between these labels and the required constraints for computation of that block.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As an example, we consider the computation of {a mathematical formula} Δ i:jd,s and {a mathematical formula} Α i:jd,s(u).</a>
