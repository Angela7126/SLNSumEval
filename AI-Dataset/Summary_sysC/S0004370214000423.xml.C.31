<a href="#0" id="0">The SMPTSP can be formulated within CP with a set of {a mathematical formula}|T| integer variables {a mathematical formula}X and one objective variable z.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}X represents task-shift assignments: More precisely, if we note {a mathematical formula}d(x) the domain of a variable {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X, then {a mathematical formula}d(xi)={j} means that task {a mathematical formula}ti is assigned to shift {a mathematical formula}sj and {a mathematical formula}d(z) gives the number of shifts assigned to at least one task.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We refer to this model as CP model:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that a maximum independent set in {a mathematical formula}GI, is not necessarily maximal in {a mathematical formula}GCI.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For instance, one may consider a non-empty set of variables with identical domains and with a difference constraint over each pair of distinct variables.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, the semantic of the problem remains the same while the global view of the AllDifferent constraints is lost.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that, we no longer use {a mathematical formula}LB ≠ as an initial lower bound, because it corresponds to the size of the largest AllDifferent constraint.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given this new model, we compare the number of optima respectively proved by {a mathematical formula} ↑ AMNV 〈 GCI|MD,Rk|R1,3 〉 ⁎ and {a mathematical formula} ↑ AMNV 〈 GCI|MD,Rk|R1,3,4 〉 ⁎ , for different values of k, after a resolution of 5 minutes (Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">11).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As justified in Section 3.5, {a mathematical formula}R4 calls the AllDifferent BC filtering algorithm on every independent set.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We now evaluate the ability of our approach to provide good bounds even on large scale instances.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For that, we evaluate the relative gap {a mathematical formula}(z¯ – z ̲ )/z¯ depending on the running model.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Both MIP model and CP model are run with a time limit of 6 minutes.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Default values for {a mathematical formula}z ̲ and {a mathematical formula}z¯ are respectively 0 and {a mathematical formula}|S|, i.e., {a mathematical formula}LB ≠ is not used.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, a run which times out without computing any bound leads to a relative gap of {a mathematical formula}100%.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In order to get tight bounds, CP model is first run 3 minutes in a bottom – up approach to compute a good lower bound and then, if no optimum has been found, 3 other minutes in a top – down mode to get a good upper bound.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Given the size of the instances, finding a feasible solution may be difficult.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">As the AtMostNValue propagation relies on lower bounding, we can expect a strong propagation during the bottom – up step.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">This is no longer expectable in a top – down approach, for which the faster propagation the better.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Therefore, the filtering of {a mathematical formula} ↓ AMNV 〈 GCI|MD,Rk|R1,3 〉 is lightened by setting k to 0.</a>
