<a href="#0" id="0">The “ best-shot ” public goods game is a network game, defined on a social network.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The simple version of the public goods game (PGG) has a fixed utility for a player who has at least a single neighbor buying the good.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Players in the general version of PGG have additional utility when multiple neighbors purchase the good.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The general version of the public goods game is shown to be a potential game, establishing the convergence to a stable state (i.e., a pure Nash equilibrium – PNE) by best-response dynamics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One can think of best-response dynamics as a distributed algorithm that runs in a fixed order of players/agents and is guaranteed to converge to a PNE.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A new distributed algorithm is proposed for finding PNEs with improved efficiency by the use of transfer of payoffs among players.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For the simple version of PGG, it is shown that the proposed algorithm can stabilize an outcome that maximizes social welfare.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the general version of the game, the proposed procedure transforms any initial outcome into a stable solution at least as efficient as the initial outcome by using transfers.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">An extensive experimental evaluation on randomly generated PGGs demonstrates that whereas pure best-response dynamics converges on stable states that have lower efficiency than the initial outcome, the proposed procedure finds PNEs of higher efficiency.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Most previous studies of equilibria of the PGG [7], [14], [15], [8] dealt with the simplified version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the simplified version the costs for taking the action are equal for all players (i.e., {a mathematical formula} ∀ i ∈ N,Ci=C) and the number of public goods that each player can benefit from accessing to is limited to 1 (i.e., {a mathematical formula}K=1).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In such a case, the utility of player i for some outcome {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V1× … ×Vn can be simplified to:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In order to show that PGG is an ordinal potential game, one must provide a global potential function and then prove that the properties of the global potential function (as given in Equation (5)) hold.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We term such a potential function as viable.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Consider a global function of the form{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Φ i(v) denotes the share of player i in the global potential function in outcome v. An intuitive and simple version of {a mathematical formula} Φ i(v) was proposed for the simplified version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game in a former paper [8]:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Despite the efficiency gap that was described in the previous section one may be able to find efficient equilibria in the “ best-shot ” public goods game by using an extended version of better-response dynamics.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In the extended scenario each player is endowed with the ability to propose a payoff transfer at each step, in response to a neighbor's proposal of her better response.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For the simple version of the PGG where {a mathematical formula}K=1, it is shown next that the players' ability to propose payoff transfers enables the extended version of better-response dynamics to converge to a stable state of greater (or equal) efficiency than that of the initial, not necessarily stable, outcome.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">When the extended better-response dynamics is applied to the general version of PGG ({a mathematical formula}K ≥ 2), there is no such theoretical guarantee for the efficiency.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Nevertheless, our experimental evaluation in Section 7 demonstrates that in practice the efficiency is improved for all the evaluated game instances.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Algorithm 2, below, is an extended version of Algorithm 1 that handles the general version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The main difference between the algorithms is that for the general version of PGG there is no guarantee regarding the improvement of the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Nevertheless, the experimental evaluation of Section 7 demonstrates that in practice Algorithm 2 yields stable outcomes of greater efficiency than that of the initial outcome.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The lack of theoretical guarantees regarding the efficiency of the outcomes stems from the fact that according to Algorithm 1 each player may secure a transfer of payoffs to at most one of its neighbors.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">This observation does not hold in the general case when {a mathematical formula}K>1.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Similarly to the simple version, Algorithm 2 terminates when a pass through all the players of the game does not yield any changes to the players' strategies.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">It is easy to see that the average efficiency of the outcomes obtained by the proposed method is higher than those obtained by better-response dynamics (Fig.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">5) for both cases ({a mathematical formula}K=1 and {a mathematical formula}K=3).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">For the simple version, where {a mathematical formula}K=1, the improvement in SW of Algorithm 1 is relatively small (Fig.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">5a).</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">However, for general PGGs with {a mathematical formula}K=3 the improvement in social welfare obtained by Algorithm 2 is quite close to that of the best PNEs (Fig.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">5b).</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">In contrast, the efficiency of the outcomes obtained by better-response dynamics is only slightly higher than that of the worst PNEs.</a>
