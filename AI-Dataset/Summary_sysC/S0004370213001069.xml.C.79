<a href="#0" id="0">But then we have that {a mathematical formula}x¯ ∉ (M ⁎ )+ and {a mathematical formula}x¯ ∈ (N ⁎ )+ and therefore {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ ≱ R+N ⁎ .Now if z is in a minimal model M then the corresponding {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ has maximal range and by the definition of {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ also {a mathematical formula}z ∈ M ⁎ , and thus z is credulously accepted.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If this does not result in a decision for the input instance, the algorithm presented in the proof of Theorem 3 is applied, yielding a complexity-sensitive procedure for deciding skeptical acceptance in the class {a mathematical formula}solprfk.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To illustrate the behavior of Algorithm 1 consider the following AF:{a mathematical formula} The AF has two preferred extensions {a mathematical formula}{b,e} and {a mathematical formula}{a,c,e} with e being the only skeptically accepted argument.Let us first test b for skeptical acceptance with Algorithm 1 and base semantics adm. Then, already in line 2 of the algorithm we obtain an admissible set attacking b, e.g.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The procedure follows the idea of the first loop in Algorithm 2, Algorithm 3, and thus in principle can decide the reasoning problems without any further investigations, but would be expensive for high values of k. To profit in cases where k is small from the complexity-sensitive perspective, and avoid unnecessary computational cost otherwise, we include again the parameter d to bound the search-depth to sets of arguments to those whose range S satisfies {a mathematical formula}|A ∖ S| ⩽ d.</a>
