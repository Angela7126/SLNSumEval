<a href="#0" id="0">The set of all leaves of a plan p is denoted by {a mathematical formula}leaves(p).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using this definition, a PR algorithm is complete if it returns a hypothesis set H such that {a mathematical formula}h ∼ rh ⁎ → h ∈ H, that is, H contains all possible hypotheses that can be refined to {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Updating an existing plan in the hypothesis with {a mathematical formula} Σ 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Query functionA query QA is a function that receives as input a plan p and outputs whether one of the plans in the correct hypothesis {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ can be refined from p.{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">SPR processSPR process takes as input a set of hypotheses {a mathematical formula}H0, a query function QA and a query policy Π .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, a query is performed on p, and the result is used to generate an updated hypothesis set {a mathematical formula}Hi+1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">2, if {a mathematical formula}QA(p1)=True then we know that the correct hypothesis {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ will contain a complete plan that is a refinement of {a mathematical formula}p11.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, the hypothesis {a mathematical formula}H4 is pruned since there is no plan in it that can be refined to a plan that is also a refinement of {a mathematical formula}p11.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let {a mathematical formula}Hk be the set of all hypotheses after k iterations and {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ is the correct hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If the query result is False, then the entropy of the resulting hypothesis set is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} Recall that {a mathematical formula} Φ (H,p,False) is the set of all hypotheses such that none of their plans can be refined to be p (Equation (3)).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Similarly, if the query result is True, then the entropy of the resulting hypothesis set is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} Recall that {a mathematical formula} Φ (H,p,True) is the set of all hypotheses that contain at least one plan which is a match of p (Equation (2)).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The hypothesis set has 6 hypotheses {a mathematical formula}H4,H5, … H9, each consisting of a plan {a mathematical formula}p4,p5, … ,p9, respectively.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let {a mathematical formula}H ′ ⊆ H be the set of hypotheses remaining after convergence of the SPR process.</a>
