<a href="#0" id="0">Using these definitions, the automated process of configuring static sequential portfolios can be defined as follows: Given a set of candidate solvers P and a set of training instances I automatically find the portfolio configuration C of solvers {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P such that it maximizes the performance of the resulting portfolio over the given benchmark I.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Alternatively, in the case of Automated Planning, instead of relying on a collection of features that describes the structure of each instance, some approaches focus on the performance of each candidate solver in a specific set of planning tasks (those that belong to the same planning domain) [4].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, 3S runs the fixed schedule of candidate solvers for 10% of the available time and the selected solver for the remaining time.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As discussed in the introduction, we propose to analyze the performance of any solver on a given benchmark using the upper bound defined by the OSS portfolio for that particular set of instances.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Otherwise, the plan quality of a solved instance was computed as the lowest (i.e., better) solution cost found by any planning system in the competition, divided by the cost of the solution s found by the participant planner p. In case of solving planning tasks optimally the quality of the resulting plans is a binary value, since plans have to be optimal.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Each candidate solver {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P is executed with every training instance {a mathematical formula}t ∈ I to obtain the sets {a mathematical formula}Spt of solutions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In case of solving problems optimally or SAT problems, a candidate solver {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P generates at most one solution {a mathematical formula}s ∈ Spt for each training instance {a mathematical formula}t ∈ I, since s should be optimal (as in the case of Automated Planning) or because it is required only to find a single solution — as in the case of SAT.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Although the usual goal for configuring portfolios is to maximize the overall solution quality or the number of solved instances, we considered an objective function that maximizes a weighted sum of overall running time (the sum of {a mathematical formula}timep for all solvers p) and quality of the solutions (quality).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">One of the main factors that influences the time required to solve the MIP task defined in the previous section is the size of the training instance set.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, in this section we analyze the question of whether there is a subset of the training problems that results in a portfolio with a similar or even equal performance (measured in overall quality or coverage) with regard to the same set of candidate solvers.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Finally, each resulting portfolio has been evaluated over the whole collection of planning tasks defined in the IPC 2011 (training set).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The results of this analysis are shown in Table 2.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">From the table, it results that the same performance (measured in coverage and time) is achieved for all the sequential portfolios derived using all sets of training problems but the first one (which consists just of those problems that were solved by at most one planner).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As it can be seen in Table 2, the minimum set of training problems necessary to configure the OSS portfolio for the IPC 2011 is the second one, which contains only 27 problems.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Hence, since the number of variables depends on the number of solvers and the 3S MIP task which considers 52 candidate solvers was solved quickly, we hypothesize that the number of candidate time values t (where solvers solve an instance) in our training data set is too small and in general, this value is much higher.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Therefore, we have performed an additional experiment with the aim of analyzing the correlation between the number of candidate time values t for each candidate solver and the time required to solve the MIP task.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This additional experiment consists of generating models using the formulation proposed by 3S and the input data defined in the design of MIPSat but considering more candidate time values t (in the discrete range {a mathematical formula}[1,5000]) for each candidate solver.</a>
