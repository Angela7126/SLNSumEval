<a href="#0" id="0">The second strategy is concerned with determining the expected value of the noisy fitness samples on the basis of their distribution, instead of their conventional averaging, as the fitness measure of the trial solutions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This paper addresses the issues of uncertainty management (regarding the selection of qualitative trial solutions) in MOO in the presence of noise by incorporating the following three policies: adaptation of the sample size of a trial solution for its periodic fitness evaluation, expected fitness estimation from the measured noisy fitness samples, and crowding-distance-induced stochastic selection.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Here a nonlinear form (capturing the relationship between the sample size of a trial solution and the fitness variance in its local neighborhood) induced by an exponential function is regarded to efficiently balance the trade-off between runtime complexity and computational accuracy.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, the average fitness presumes equal probability of occurrence of all fitness samples, and thus returns a poor fitness estimate when the noise variance (in the fitness measure of the solutions) in the local neighborhood of a selected trial solution is large.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, the statistical expectation of the fitness samples is referred to as the “ fitness measure of the trial solutions. ” On the basis of the proposed strategies, Goldberg's method [7] is extended to verify possible accommodation of slightly inferior population members in the optimal Pareto front.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Occurrence probability of the fitness samples: It is evident from the proposed nonuniform partitioning of the sample space that the fitness samples in the longer intervals are rare samples, probably owing to noise, and hence their contribution to the true fitness estimate of {a mathematical formula}X → i should not be regarded similarly to that of the fitness samples in the smaller interval.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We obtain the expected value — say, {a mathematical formula}E(fk(X → i))=f ‾ k(X → i) — of the kth fitness of {a mathematical formula}X → i by (9):{a mathematical formula}The expected value thus obtained provides a unique measure of the kth objective of {a mathematical formula}X → i from the noisy local distribution of its fitness samples over a wide space.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The interquartile range corresponding to {a mathematical formula}fk(X → i) is then used as a measure of {a mathematical formula}sk,i as defined by (10) for {a mathematical formula}k=[1,N]:{a mathematical formula}To eliminate the impact of the extreme values of the noisy fitness samples, the interquartile range is referred to as a measure of the spread of the samples of {a mathematical formula}fk(X → i) from the respective expected measurement {a mathematical formula}f ‾ k(X → i), instead of the sample variance.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Termination criteria for the algorithm include a bound by the maximum number of function evaluations (FEs) or the achievement of a sufficiently low difference between the performance metric values (discussed in Section 5.3) of two successive generations or aggregations thereof.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The uncertainty problem is resolved here by weighting the size of the objective space covered by a nondominated solution {a mathematical formula}X → with the probability that {a mathematical formula}X → dominates at least one population member.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The higher the probability, the more reliable the measure of the objective space covered by {a mathematical formula}X → .</a>
