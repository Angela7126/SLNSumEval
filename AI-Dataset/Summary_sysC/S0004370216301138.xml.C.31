<a href="#1" id="1">2 visualizes the improvements algorithm configuration yielded for the best-performing solver Clasp-3.0.4-p8 on these benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Improvements were particularly large on the GI instances, where algorithm configuration decreased the number of timeouts from 42 to 6.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 5 summarizes the results we obtained for all solvers on these benchmarks, showing that configuration also substantially improved the performance of many other solvers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The table also aggregates results across both benchmark families to yield overall results for the crafted SAT+UNSAT track.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">While Forl-nodrup showed the best default performance and benefited substantially from configuration (#timeouts reduced from 135 to 98), Clasp-3.0.4-p8 improved even more (#timeouts reduced from 139 to 96).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The Random SAT+UNSAT track consisted of three random benchmarks detailed in Appendix A.3: 3cnf, K3, and unif-k5.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The instances in unif-k5 are all unsatisfiable, while the other two sets contain both satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Fig.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">6 visualizes the improvements achieved by configuration on these benchmarks for the best-performing solver Clasp-3.0.4-p8.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Clasp-3.0.4-p8 benefited most from configuration on benchmark 3cnf, where it reduced the number of timeouts from 18 to 0.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For the other benchmarks, it could already solve all instances in its default parameter configuration, but configuration helped reduce its average runtime by factors of 3 (K3) and 2 (unif-k5), respectively.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Table 12 summarizes the results of all solvers for these benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We note that solver DCCASat+march-rw showed the best default performance, and that after configuration, it also solved all instances from the three benchmark sets, only ranking behind Clasp-3.0.4-p8 because the latter solved these instances faster.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">5sat500 This set contains 500 5-SAT instances generated uniformly at random with a clause-to-variable ratio of 20.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Each instance is satisfiable and has 500 variables and 10000 clauses.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This set was first used for tuning the SAT solver Captain Jack and other SLS solvers [81].</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We used the original uniform random split into 250 training and test instances in the 2014 CSSC (random satisfiable track).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">7sat90 This set contains 500 7-SAT instances generated uniformly at random with a clause-to-variable ratio of 85.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Each instance is satisfiable and has 90 variables and 7650 clauses.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This set was also first used for tuning the SAT solver Captain Jack and other SLS solvers [81].</a>
