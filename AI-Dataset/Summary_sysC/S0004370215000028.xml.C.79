<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}DL be any classical description logic language, and {a mathematical formula}DLN be the extension of {a mathematical formula}DL with a new concept name {a mathematical formula}NC for each {a mathematical formula}DL concept C. The new concept names {a mathematical formula}NC are called normality concepts, and are meant to denote the normal, standard or prototypical instances of C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A {a mathematical formula}DLN model of a set of {a mathematical formula}DLN axioms {a mathematical formula}S (that may possibly comprise both inclusions and assertions) is a {a mathematical formula}DLN interpretation that satisfies all the axioms in {a mathematical formula}S. As usual, if {a mathematical formula}I is a {a mathematical formula}DLN model of {a mathematical formula}S then we write {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ S, and if a sentence Α is satisfied by all the {a mathematical formula}DLN models of {a mathematical formula}S then we say that Α is a logical consequence of {a mathematical formula}S and write {a mathematical formula}S ⊨ Α .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While many of our results apply to all priority relations, in the examples (unless otherwise stated) we will assume that ≺ is determined by so-called specificity:{a mathematical formula} With the above definition, the specific properties of {a mathematical formula}pre( Δ 1) may override those of the more general concept {a mathematical formula}pre( Δ 2).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}KB) iff there exists no pre-model {a mathematical formula}J of {a mathematical formula}KB satisfying all of the following conditions:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let Σ be any finite set of normality concepts containing at least all the normality concepts explicitly occurring either in{a mathematical formula}KB or in the query of interest.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Next, for all sets of {a mathematical formula}DL axioms {a mathematical formula}S ′ and all DIs Δ , let {a mathematical formula}S ′ ↓ ≺ Δ denote the result of removing from {a mathematical formula}S ′ all the axioms {a mathematical formula} Δ 0NC such that {a mathematical formula} Δ 0's priority is not higher than Δ 's:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Now we can define the classical knowledge base {a mathematical formula}KB Σ corresponding to {a mathematical formula}KB with the following inductive construction (where {a mathematical formula}i=1,2, … ,z):{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} In informal terms, the first step in constructing {a mathematical formula}KB Σ consists in extending {a mathematical formula}S with the axioms {a mathematical formula}NC ⊑ C implicitly satisfied by {a mathematical formula}DLN's semantics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In summary, the next result shows that if normality concepts occur neither in {a mathematical formula}KB nor in the DI Δ , then the condition in Theorem 3 needs to be checked only over a finite, representative set of normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NC, defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{sup:22} Note, however, that the queries {a mathematical formula}N{a} ⊑ D simply constitute an alternative way of inspecting the same models: these queries are consequences of {a mathematical formula}KB iff a belongs to D in all the {a mathematical formula}DLN-models where a satisfies its default properties, that is, {a mathematical formula}N{a}(a) holds.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Suppose that{a mathematical formula}C ≡ Dis a (classically) valid equivalence and let{a mathematical formula}KB¯be a knowledge base obtained from{a mathematical formula}KB by replacing some occurrences of C with D. If ≺ is semantic, then</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A simple inspection of the proof of Theorem 8 shows that the rational closure properties that are not valid in {a mathematical formula}DLN are in sharp contrast with the idea of overriding as inconsistency with more specific axioms.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">2 with premises {a mathematical formula} Δ 1, Δ 2 and conclusion Δ , consider the following weak interpretation: For all normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NX: if {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ 1, {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ 2, and neither {a mathematical formula} Δ 1 nor {a mathematical formula} Δ 2 are overridden in {a mathematical formula}NX, then for all {a mathematical formula}DLN-models {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}KB, {a mathematical formula}NX satisfies the conclusion Δ (i.e.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Actually, (LLE) is valid under the strong interpretation (39) not only if {a mathematical formula}C ≡ D is a tautology, but also when it is a strong consequence of {a mathematical formula}KB, provided that the priority relation is semantic.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The inference problems of many important description logics belong to deterministic time or space complexity classes {a mathematical formula}C ⊇ P (such as PSPACE or ExpTime) such that {a mathematical formula}PC equals {a mathematical formula}C. As a consequence, {a mathematical formula}DLN preserves their complexity:</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Although most of our results hold for unrestricted knowledge bases, the “ mainstream ” use of the strong part {a mathematical formula}S of {a mathematical formula}KB is specifying classically valid axioms that do not involve normality concepts, because such concepts are supposed to be defined by the DIs in {a mathematical formula}D. By adhering to this discipline, one obtains what we call a canonical knowledge base:</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The resulting KB is correct, and hence reasoning about nominals can be reduced to an instance problem in a {a mathematical formula}DL theory without nominals.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As a consequence, Default DLs cannot encode Example 12, because the range of role {a mathematical formula}has_organ consists of implicit individuals to which default rules do not apply.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Differently from {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin, they have a special inclusion operator for DIs but no equivalent of N. They satisfy the Rational closure axioms and are subject to inheritance blocking, like {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin (Example 6, Example 30 are not dealt with correctly).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">These logics, introduced in [40], extend classical DLs with conditional constraints{a mathematical formula}(D|C)[l,u] whose intended meaning is: “ by default, the typical instances of C belong to D with probability {a mathematical formula}p ∈ [l,u] ” .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Accordingly, in the above knowledge base, a must necessarily be a “ classical ” individual that is not subject to any conditional constraint (while {a mathematical formula}DLN permits to use {a mathematical formula}{a} in the left-hand side of DIs, for all individuals a).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Let {a mathematical formula}J be the extension of {a mathematical formula}J0 obtained by setting {a mathematical formula}ND ′ J= ∅ for all normality concepts {a mathematical formula}ND ′ ∉ Σ .Note that {a mathematical formula}J is indeed a {a mathematical formula}DLN interpretation, since (i) for all {a mathematical formula}ND ′ ∉ Σ , the axiom {a mathematical formula}ND ′ ⊑ D ′ is vacuously satisfied by construction of {a mathematical formula}J, and (ii) for all {a mathematical formula}ND ′ ∈ Σ , {a mathematical formula}J satisfies {a mathematical formula}ND ′ ⊑ D ′ because {a mathematical formula}J agrees with {a mathematical formula}J0 on the interpretation of all {a mathematical formula}DL Σ sentences (by construction), and {a mathematical formula}J0 satisfies {a mathematical formula}ND ′ ⊑ D ′ because this inclusion belongs to {a mathematical formula}S0 Σ .Clearly, by construction, {a mathematical formula}J satisfies {a mathematical formula}S (the strong part of {a mathematical formula}KB) as well as conditions 1 and 2 of Definition 1.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">By analogy with the base case, it can be seen that {a mathematical formula}J is actually a {a mathematical formula}DLN interpretation, that {a mathematical formula}J is a pre-model of {a mathematical formula}KB, and that {a mathematical formula}J satisfies conditions 1 – 2 of Definition 1.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">By Theorem 3, in order to disprove a query {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ , for a DI Δ , it is sufficient to find a normality concept {a mathematical formula}NC such that {a mathematical formula}KB{NC} ↓ ≺ Δ ∪ { Δ NC} ⊭ NC ⊑ ⊥ and {a mathematical formula}KB{NC} ⊭ Δ NC (intuitively, Δ is neither overridden nor satisfied in {a mathematical formula}NC).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Assuming the contrary, there exists a model {a mathematical formula}J of {a mathematical formula}KB{NC} and an individual {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Δ J s.t.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Suppose that{a mathematical formula}C ≡ Dis a (classically) valid equivalence and let{a mathematical formula}KB¯be a knowledge base obtained from{a mathematical formula}KB by replacing some occurrences of C with D. If ≺ is semantic, then</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">By Theorem 1, {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Α can be verified by constructing {a mathematical formula}KB Σ and checking whether {a mathematical formula}KB Σ ⊨ Α , where Σ is the set of normality concepts occurring in {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α } and hence{a mathematical formula} As a preliminary step, {a mathematical formula}D must be linearized according to the preference relation ≺ , using any standard sorting algorithm.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Note that F has one occurrence in {a mathematical formula}KB and that such occurrence is positive, so a witness {a mathematical formula}J that Δ is not overridden in {a mathematical formula}NC/I can be obtained from {a mathematical formula}I simply by setting {a mathematical formula}FJ= Δ J= Δ I, {a mathematical formula}AJ=AI for all concept names {a mathematical formula}A ≠ F, and {a mathematical formula}NDJ=NDI for all normality concepts {a mathematical formula}ND.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">This follows immediately from the definitions of {a mathematical formula}NCI and {a mathematical formula}FI, so the proof of Claim 4 is completed.Finally, Claim 3, Claim 4 prove that the reduction is correct; the theorem follows immediately.</a>
