<a href="#0" id="0">As usual, {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ Φ denotes that the interpretation {a mathematical formula}I is a model of an SO-sentence Φ , and {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊨ Φ denotes that the SO-sentence Φ follows from the set of SO-sentences Φ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then there does not exist any model {a mathematical formula}J of {a mathematical formula}T with {a mathematical formula}I| Σ =J| Σ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Conversely, assume that {a mathematical formula}I is a model of {a mathematical formula}T such that there does not exist any model {a mathematical formula}J of {a mathematical formula}T with {a mathematical formula}I| Σ =J| Σ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We will see below that no such example exists if concept definitions the form {a mathematical formula}A ≡ ⊤ ⊓ ⋯ ⊓ ⊤ are disallowed.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In fact, the only interesting equivalence is the first one, where we exploit that {a mathematical formula} Σ =sig(T1) ∩ sig(T2).The upper bound proofs are by reduction to Σ -inseparability with Σ a concept signature, for which corresponding upper bounds have been established in Theorem 14, Theorem 9.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">For a proof by contradiction assume that {a mathematical formula}J is such a model of {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We show that then there exists a model {a mathematical formula}J ′ of {a mathematical formula}T2 such that {a mathematical formula}J ′ | Σ =I| Σ and thus obtain a contradiction.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given{a mathematical formula}EL- or{a mathematical formula}ELI-TBoxes{a mathematical formula}T1and{a mathematical formula}T2and concept signatures Σ , it is{a mathematical formula}coNExpNP-complete to decide{a mathematical formula}T1 ≡ Σ T2.Containment in {a mathematical formula}coNExpNP follows from Theorem 9, which shows that the problem is in {a mathematical formula}coNExpNP even for {a mathematical formula}ALCI-TBoxes.Hardness is (essentially) proved by reduction of Σ -entailment for {a mathematical formula}ALC-TBoxes and concept signatures Σ , which is {a mathematical formula}coNExpNP-hard by Theorem 10.More precisely, for {a mathematical formula}ALC-TBoxes {a mathematical formula}T1 and {a mathematical formula}T2 and a set Σ of concept names, we construct {a mathematical formula}EL-TBoxes {a mathematical formula}T1 ′ ,T2 ′ and a signature {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ consisting of concept names only the following two statements are equivalent:</a>
