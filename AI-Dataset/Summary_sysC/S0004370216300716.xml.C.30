<a href="#6" id="6">Given an SN {a mathematical formula}S=(V,E,VL, Ω ), a GAP Π , and a property p, the diffusion centrality problem consists of finding the DC (w.r.t.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">Moreover, suppose none of v's friends have {a mathematical formula}sp relations.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then, v is an “ unnecessary ” vertex (for the purpose of computing DC) because there is no rule {a mathematical formula}r ∈ Π hiv by which vertex v can receive property {a mathematical formula}hiv or transmit {a mathematical formula}hiv to other vertices.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In fact, it is easy to see from the rules above that a vertex cannot transmit {a mathematical formula}hiv if it does not have {a mathematical formula}sp relations.</a>
