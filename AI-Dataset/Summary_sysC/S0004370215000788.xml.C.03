<a href="#0" id="0">Given the learned models, we propose two types of optimization methods: a black-box best-first search approach, and a novel white-box approach that maps learned regression models to integer linear programs (ILP), which can then be solved by any ILP-solver.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Two agents {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}A2 take part in a sequential auction of items.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For sale are items {a mathematical formula}r1 and {a mathematical formula}r2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This auction design problem is a typical example where the mathematical optimization model cannot be fully determined, and hence, machine learning and data mining techniques can come into play.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given the models, we propose two approaches to find the optimal ordering for a new set of items: (1) a best-first search that uses the models as a black-box to evaluate different orderings of the items; and (2) a novel white-box optimization method that translates the models and the set of items into a mixed-integer program (MIP) and runs this in an ILP-solver (CPLEX).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">One of the main contributions of this paper is the realization that learned regression models can be evaluated efficiently inside modern mathematical optimization solvers.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Although we use sequential auction design to illustrate our method, all of our constructions are general and can be applied to any optimization setting where unknown relations can be represented using regression models that have been learned from data.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In Section 2, we formally introduce the problem of optimal ordering for sequential auctions (OOSA), and then we show how to learn regression models from historical auction data in Section 3 using standard machine learning methods.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Based on the learned models, our white-box optimization method and a black-box optimization are introduced to find the optimal ordering for OOSA in Section 4.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In one auction, a set of n items S with type set {a mathematical formula}R ′ ⊆ R will be auctioned sequentially using a predetermined order.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The optimization problem we study is: given a set of items and budget constrained bidders, finding an optimal ordering of items in sequential auctions such that the expected revenue is maximized.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The regression tree (or LASSO) can be used to evaluate the values of selling different items based on the feature values that are computed on a given ordering of the items.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The learned regression trees (or LASSO functions) are then used in two ways to model the optimization problem OOSA: (1) Black-box optimization.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Subsequently, we learn regression trees for both item types {a mathematical formula}r1 and {a mathematical formula}r2, as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In Appendix A, we also provide hardness results that demonstrate there is little hope (unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP) of finding an efficient (polynomial-time) algorithm that gives the optimal ordering for any regression tree or linear regression predictor.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Given regression tree and linear regression models for the expected value per item type, we automatically formulate the problem of finding an optimal ordering as a mixed integer linear program (MIP).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Item i is of type r if and only if {a mathematical formula}xi,r=1.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We require that at every index i at most one item type is auctioned, and that the total number of auctioned items of type r is equal to the number {a mathematical formula}nr of type r items in S.{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We aim to maximize the expected values {a mathematical formula}pi,r:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">It states that if {a mathematical formula}xi,r is true, then the values of {a mathematical formula}pi,r is determined using the regression function.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Given the learned trees in Example 2, suppose we are asked to order a new multiset of items {a mathematical formula}{r1,r2,r2}.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Model evaluation: we use the learned regression models to evaluate the solutions returned by the ordering methods to compute the predicted revenues.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">4 shows that all regression models lead to good prediction, with the lowest {a mathematical formula}R2 score over 0.86.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Interestingly, despite their lower {a mathematical formula}R2 scores, the linear regression LP methods return good orderings especially lasso2lp and lasso3lp which are on average better than the three regression tree LP models.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">It is more obvious from this figure that the proposed linear regression LP models are the better optimization methods than the tree LP models in practice.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">We checked this cause by investigating whether the {a mathematical formula}R2 scores of the depth 8 regression tree are correlated with which method performing better in the model evaluation.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Specifically, when deciding what value to bid on the current item {a mathematical formula}ri, they have access to the auction simulator and use it to run the remaining items {a mathematical formula}I ′ ∖ ri.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The {a mathematical formula}R2-scores obtained in these experiments are shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The model results show that also in these cases, white-box methods outperform black-box ones, with the only exception for depth 8 regression trees where the performance of white-box and black-box is similar.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">In every possible next state {a mathematical formula}q ′ , the set of available items is equal to {a mathematical formula}I − {i}, i.e., equal to the items in q minus the sold item i.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">The necessary changes may include the selection of the features for learning regression models and the encoding in the white-box optimization model.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">The regression tree for every item type {a mathematical formula}ri is shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">The following ordering then gives a value of {a mathematical formula} ∑ 1 ≤ i ≤ nvi:{a mathematical formula} In this ordering, {a mathematical formula} ∑ 1 ≤ i ≤ |A|v(ai)=k by definition of A and since {a mathematical formula}sum(y)=0 before item y is auctioned.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">The objective value is then given by {a mathematical formula} ∑ 1 ≤ i ≤ |A|v(ai)+v(y)+ ∑ 1 ≤ i ≤ |B|v(bi).</a>
