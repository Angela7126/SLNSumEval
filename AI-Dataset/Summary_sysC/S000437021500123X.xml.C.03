<a href="#0" id="0">The default layer also contains knowledge of action effects on the instance state.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using knowledge in the diagnostic layer, one can also make assumptions predicting new default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This incompleteness in knowledge requires open-world planning — that is, planning that takes into account the fact that new entities may become known to the robot during plan execution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To create these extensions, the planner has assumptive actions it can take, each making one or more assumptions about instance knowledge.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">3) is to move to the hypothesized meeting room and to plan to conduct a visual search for the object when the robot gets there.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The first type extends the action models from the default layer with knowledge of how those actions might fail.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The second type of diagnostic knowledge is a new set of assumptive actions that can hypothesize new pieces of default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, Dora can plan and verify explanations that lead to updating of both instance and default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The potential functions {a mathematical formula} Φ rc( ⋅ , ⋅ ) come from the default knowledge about connectivity of room types.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Executing the action causes the robot to be at ?to, turns it into a place node, and has a knowledge effect which will be explained in the next section.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The knowledge predicate {a mathematical formula}K(v) can be used to model the effects of sensing actions.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Assumptive actions allow us to model probabilistic instance states — for example, in the relational map.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula} Π 0 is a solution to the original planning task Π ; that is, a plan that reaches g from the initial state {a mathematical formula}s0.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{a mathematical formula}si,i>0 is the state observed by the robot after executing {a mathematical formula} Π i − 1e.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">{a mathematical formula} Π i is a solution to the modified planning task {a mathematical formula} Π i= 〈 V,A,si,g 〉 ; that is, a plan that reaches g from the previous observed state {a mathematical formula}si.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The expected state after plan {a mathematical formula} Π i is denoted {a mathematical formula}si+1 ′ =app(si, Π ia, Π ie) and is the result of the application of {a mathematical formula} Π i's assumptions and executed actions from its initial state.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">SurpriseLet {a mathematical formula} Π i be the ith plan in a continual planning process with initial state {a mathematical formula}si, expected state {a mathematical formula}si+1 ′ after execution of {a mathematical formula} Π ie, and observed state {a mathematical formula}si+1.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The planner is allowed to make all the assumptions {a mathematical formula}Aa of the original plan, but the only physical actions that are allowed are the executed actions of the original plan.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Thus, the planning problem has a solution only if the planner can find a sequence of assumptions that allow all the original physical actions to be executed in sequence, and which results in expected and actual observations {a mathematical formula}si matching.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In the second case, by our allowing instance assumptions based on default knowledge, explanations posit the existence of new places or objects — such as the existence of a new room the object might be in.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In the diagnostic layer there are corresponding default assumptions that can hypothesize new default knowledge about state.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Thus, default assumptions allow the robot to generate more general explanations than are possible with instance assumptions alone.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The diagnostic actions and default assumptive actions are employed only for planning of explanations.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Diagnostic actions are restricted to planning of explanations because their many conditional effects slow regular task planning.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">It also shows the use of instance assumptions from instance knowledge to plan under uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">This experiment shows the ability of the system to use a mix of default assumptions and instance assumptions to create explanations for task failure.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">This shows the ability to plan again with instance assumptions in order to verify an explanation that involves hypothesized new default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Under test condition {a mathematical formula}Claser, the robot was able to categorize all rooms in {a mathematical formula}600±389 seconds.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">An example run of test condition {a mathematical formula}Cc (object in meeting room) is shown Fig.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">It also shows the use of assumptive actions based on default knowledge to fill in incomplete state information, with their probabilities being generated from the default-knowledge graph.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">As the robot was certain about one room being an office and not so certain about there being a meeting room, it could make the assumption that no magazine was present with high probability (0.82).</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">In these runs, the robot tried to verify both the hypotheses about new instance knowledge and the hypotheses about new default knowledge.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Probabilistic approaches which do reason about sensing effects have been applied to object search and robot planning in a variety of settings.</a>
