<a href="#0" id="0">The 2014 UT Austin Villa team introduced an extensive layered learning approach to learn skills for the robot such as getting up, walking, and kicking.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This approach includes sequential layered learning where a newly learned layer is frozen before learning of subsequent layers, as well as overlapping layers where parts of previously learned layers are re-optimized as part of the current layer being learned.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">After every RoboCup competition teams are required to release the binaries that they used during the competition.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to analyze the performance of the different components of our overlapping layered learning approach before the 2014 competition, we played 1000 games with different versions of the UT Austin Villa team against each of the top three teams from the RoboCup 2013 competition.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To isolate the performance of kicking learned through an overlapping layered learning approach we disable all kicking (except for on kickoffs where we once again have a robot kick the ball as far as possible toward the opponent's goal without scoring) and used an “ always dribble ” behavior.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Data from playing against the top three teams at the RoboCup 2013 competition when only dribbling is shown in Table 4.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The robot learns a kicking motion to kick the ball a long distance starting from a standing position behind the ball.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The robot learns a kicking motion to kick the ball over opponents starting from a standing position behind the ball.</a>
