<a href="#0" id="0">A belief function Bel on a distributive lattice is Bayesian (or a probability function) iff all its focal elements are join-irreducibles.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So a Bayesian belief function (or probability function) Μ on a distributive lattice {a mathematical formula}L=J(P) for some poset P is more like a point function than a set function in its level of complexity in the sense that Μ is determined by its values at elements of P (which correspond to principal order ideals in P) rather by its values at all order ideals of P (all values at non-principal order ideals are 0).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This implies that generally probability functions are simpler and easier to describe than belief functions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The significance of this perspective is that the satisfiability problem of a given belief formula with respect to the class of belief-function structures is equivalent to that with respect to the class of probability-function structures.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">So we can translate the complexity of satisfiability problem with respect to the class of belief-function structures into that of satisfiability problem with respect to the class of probability structures, which follows directly from the well-known result in [18] with respect to the class of Boolean algebras as well as the representation theorem for distributive lattices (Theorem A.2 in Appendix A).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In Section 5, we show that the complexity of deciding whether a belief formula is satisfiable with respect to the class of belief-function structures on distributive lattices (especially on those structures for many non-classical logics) is NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let P be the set {a mathematical formula}{(A,s):s ∈ A,A ∈ J(PD)} with the identity relation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ ={(A,s):s ∈ A} for any {a mathematical formula}A ∈ J(P).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It is easy to see that, if {a mathematical formula}A ≠ B, then {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ ∩ B ⁎ = ∅ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In addition, {a mathematical formula} ⋃ A ∈ J(PD)A ⁎ =P.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We take {a mathematical formula}{A ⁎ :A ∈ J(PD)} to be the “ basis ” for the distributive lattice {a mathematical formula}L ′ in the sense that {a mathematical formula}L ′ is the set of all finite unions of elements {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We can show by induction on the complexity of Φ that, for all formulas {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Φ 0, {a mathematical formula}v( Φ )={(B,s):s ∈ vD( Φ ) ∩ B,B ∈ J(PD)}.Now we will show that such defined probability structure {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 P,L,L ′ , Μ ,v 〉 is equivalent to the belief structure D. For each formula Φ and {a mathematical formula}A ∈ J(PD), we have {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ ⊆ v( Φ ) iff {a mathematical formula}(A,s) ∈ v( Φ ) for all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ A iff {a mathematical formula}s ∈ vD( Φ ) for all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ A iff {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ vD( Φ ).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">So the largest “ measurable ” set (simply the largest element in {a mathematical formula}L ′ ) contained in {a mathematical formula}v( Φ ) is {a mathematical formula} ⋃ A ⊆ vD( Φ )A ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">On the other hand, given any possible-world-like structure for the logic {a mathematical formula}L, the interpretations of the formulas is an algebra that characterizes {a mathematical formula}L. So, in the following section, before we reason about belief functions on specific classes of algebras, we elaborate on this kind of duality between logics and their corresponding algebraic structures (and possible-world-like semantics) and won ʼ t distinguish belief functions on algebras and for their logics.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Given a basic belief formula {a mathematical formula}f:=a1bel( Φ 1)+a2bel( Φ 2)+ ⋯ +akbel( Φ k) ⩾ b and a probability structure {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 S,L,L ′ ,v, Μ 〉 on a Routley structure {a mathematical formula}S:= 〈 S, ⩽ ,g,v 〉 where {a mathematical formula}L=J(S), {a mathematical formula}L ′ is a sublattice of L and Μ is a probability function on {a mathematical formula}L ′ , M satisfies f (denoted as {a mathematical formula}M ⊨ f) if{a mathematical formula}We then extend the above ⊨ in the obvious way to all belief formulas.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">From the constraints in {a mathematical formula}f ˜ and Theorem 3.2, it follows that Bel is a belief function on the canonical Routley structure.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Moreover, the constraints in {a mathematical formula}f ˆ guarantees that f is satisfied in this canonical structure.Now we are back to show the theorem.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Actually the whole argument there works to show that each DS structure {a mathematical formula}B:= 〈 S, ⩽ ,g,v,Bel 〉 on a de Morgan lattice {a mathematical formula}J(S) (or on a Routley structure {a mathematical formula} 〈 S, ⩽ ,g,v 〉 ) is equivalent to a probability structure {a mathematical formula}M:= 〈 S ′ ,L,L ′ ,v ′ , Μ ′ 〉 where {a mathematical formula}L=2S ′ , {a mathematical formula}L ′ is a Boolean algebra and {a mathematical formula} Μ ′ is a probability function on {a mathematical formula}L ′ in the sense that, for any formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Φ ,{a mathematical formula}Note that, compared to Theorems 3.22 (and Corollary 3.23), our equivalence here is stronger because the language Φ here includes the negation ∼ while {a mathematical formula} Φ 0 in Theorems 3.22 (and Corollary 3.23) does not.</a>
