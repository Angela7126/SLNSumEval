<a href="#0" id="0">The second function receives an offer vector {a mathematical formula} Ω → which specifies the issue values for all the negotiation issues of a new offer recently received from the opponent.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That is, as soon as a new offer is received from the opponent, this function is invoked to update the model based on this newly received bid.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It updates the estimated preference profile of the opponent by adjusting {a mathematical formula}evaliOP( Ω i) and {a mathematical formula}wi values (Algorithm: lines 18 and 21).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Whenever a new offer is received from the opponent, the perceptron learning delta rules (Algorithm: lines 18 and 21) are repeated N times.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The {a mathematical formula}EstimatedUtilityOP( Ω → ) is a function which receives an offer as the input and returns the estimated utility value of that offer in the opponent's utility space as the output.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This proposed model is a supervised algorithm, thus it needs output labels for training instances.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The problem of preference modeling in bilateral multi issue negotiations through supervised learning methods can be separated in two sub-problems: 1) estimating the utility values of the opponent's offer history (the history of the offers received from the opponent through the negotiation session) and 2) extracting the estimated utility function (or the preference profile) of the opponent from the opponent's offer history.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By solving the first problem, now the opponent's offer history contains all the estimated offer utilities for each offer in the opponent's offer history.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The {a mathematical formula}EstimatedUtilityOP( Ω → ) function which deals with the first sub-problem, can be estimated according to the perceived bidding behavior of the opponent.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this article, four different values – three constant (0.6, 0.8, and 1) and one adaptive – are applied in order to estimate the utilities of the offers proposed by the opponent.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Applying the constant values for estimating the utility value of the bids received from the opponent may seem simplistic at first, but actually it is not.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As explained in Section 1, the opponent modeling problem in negotiation is a specific type of a learning problem, where all of the training examples are not provided in advance, but are provided throughout the negotiation session in an incremental manner.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In fact, designing a preference model which is able to update in an incremental manner is one of the important challenges in modeling the user preferences in bilateral multi issue negotiations.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">More importantly, in such models the number of bids that the agents exchange before reaching deadline is limited [2], and this is another important challenge that an opponent model should overcome.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Although estimating the utilities of the bids received by the opponent through a constant function may not be the best choice, it could at least be a reasonable assumption, whereas the rational agents try to reach the highest utility by following a concession-based bidding strategy [2].</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For example, 1) assuming “ most of the bids that the opponent sends throughout the negotiation session have utilities around a value such as 1 ” would not be an unreasonable assumption, and 2) in the Scalable Bayesian Model proposed by Hindriks et al.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In the setting adopted in Experiment I (Section 5.1.1), the accuracy of this proposed model is evaluated together with other opponent models through a Pearson Correlation between the estimated and real bid utilities [38]:{a mathematical formula} where, {a mathematical formula}uOP is the real utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ is the estimated utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP( Ω → ) is the real utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space, and {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ ( Ω → ) is the estimated utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space.</a>
