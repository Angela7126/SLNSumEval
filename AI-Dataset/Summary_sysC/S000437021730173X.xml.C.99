<a href="#0" id="0">We next examine possible blow-ups; then we show that our method is exponentially separated from all previous search reduction techniques; then we show how to design (augmented-optimal) search algorithms for {a mathematical formula} Θ Π F.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we pointed out, the decoupled state space is, in general, infinite due to (1) different center paths, and due to (2) different pricing functions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Specifically, here and in the discussions below, by an exponential separation from X, where X is an alternate search reduction method, we mean a family {a mathematical formula}{ Π n|n ∈ N+} of planning tasks, of size (number of state variables and actions) polynomially related to n, so that (i) the number of reachable decoupled states is bounded by a polynomial in n, while (ii) the state space size under X is exponential in n. In most cases, the exponential separation will be our Scaling example, fixing, for simplicity, the number of locations to be the same as the number n of objects {a mathematical formula}oi to transport.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">State space search here is guided by a heuristic function, heuristic for short, a function h that maps states s to estimates of remaining cost, i.e., of the cost of an optimal solution for s. We denote that latter cost as the perfect heuristic{a mathematical formula}h ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To prove (i), say first that {a mathematical formula}p ∈ [s].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the corresponding embedded state {a mathematical formula}p ˆ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As all compliant path graph vertices in {a mathematical formula}p ˆ are reached at s, for every {a mathematical formula}FL there must exist a path {a mathematical formula} Π [FL] from {a mathematical formula}I[FL]0 to {a mathematical formula}p ˆ (FL) in {a mathematical formula}CompG Π [ Π C[s],FL].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From the collection of these paths, along with {a mathematical formula} Π C[s], we obtain an embedded path {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ from {a mathematical formula}I ˆ to {a mathematical formula}p ˆ : simply interleave the embedded {a mathematical formula}FC transitions induced by {a mathematical formula} Π C[s] with the embedded {a mathematical formula}FL transitions induced by the {a mathematical formula} Π [FL].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">With Lemma 7, from {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ we obtain a path Π as desired.Say now that Π is a path in Π from I to some p, where the center action subsequence of Π is {a mathematical formula} Π C[s].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">With Lemma 7, we obtain an embedded path {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ from {a mathematical formula}I ˆ to {a mathematical formula}p ˆ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Collecting the {a mathematical formula}FL transitions from {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ for each {a mathematical formula}FL, clearly we get paths {a mathematical formula} Π [FL] from {a mathematical formula}I[FL]0 to {a mathematical formula}p ˆ (FL) in {a mathematical formula}CompG Π [ Π C[s],FL].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}p ∈ [s] as desired.Claim (ii) now follows directly, because the above shows that, for every {a mathematical formula}p ∈ [s], the paths Π as specified are in one-to-one correspondence with {a mathematical formula} Π C[s] augmented with the possible selections of {a mathematical formula}CompG Π [ Π C[s],FL] paths from {a mathematical formula}I[FL]0 to {a mathematical formula}p[FL]n, where {a mathematical formula}n:=| Π C[s]|.</a>
