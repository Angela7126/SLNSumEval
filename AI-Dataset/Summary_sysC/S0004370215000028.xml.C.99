<a href="#0" id="0">A {a mathematical formula}DLN model of a set of {a mathematical formula}DLN axioms {a mathematical formula}S (that may possibly comprise both inclusions and assertions) is a {a mathematical formula}DLN interpretation that satisfies all the axioms in {a mathematical formula}S. As usual, if {a mathematical formula}I is a {a mathematical formula}DLN model of {a mathematical formula}S then we write {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ S, and if a sentence Α is satisfied by all the {a mathematical formula}DLN models of {a mathematical formula}S then we say that Α is a logical consequence of {a mathematical formula}S and write {a mathematical formula}S ⊨ Α .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While many of our results apply to all priority relations, in the examples (unless otherwise stated) we will assume that ≺ is determined by so-called specificity:{a mathematical formula} With the above definition, the specific properties of {a mathematical formula}pre( Δ 1) may override those of the more general concept {a mathematical formula}pre( Δ 2).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In summary, the next result shows that if normality concepts occur neither in {a mathematical formula}KB nor in the DI Δ , then the condition in Theorem 3 needs to be checked only over a finite, representative set of normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NC, defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then,{a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ if and only if the condition:{a mathematical formula}holds for all{a mathematical formula}X= 〚 D ′ 〛 such that{a mathematical formula}D ′ ⊆ D.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The obvious decision method for DI inference based on this theorem needs to check the condition in its statement for all {a mathematical formula}2|D| possible X.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Suppose that{a mathematical formula}C ≡ Dis a (classically) valid equivalence and let{a mathematical formula}KB¯be a knowledge base obtained from{a mathematical formula}KB by replacing some occurrences of C with D. If ≺ is semantic, then</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Assume that {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ 1 and {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ 2.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let {a mathematical formula}I be a model of {a mathematical formula}KB, we prove that {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ KB Δ .Let {a mathematical formula}NX be a normality concept, assume first that {a mathematical formula} Δ 1 is overridden in {a mathematical formula}NX/I.We prove that also Δ is overridden in {a mathematical formula}NX/I.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By definition of overriding, for all pre-models {a mathematical formula}J of {a mathematical formula}KB such that {a mathematical formula}I ≤ Δ 1J it holds that {a mathematical formula}NXJ= ∅ or {a mathematical formula}NX ∉ satJ( Δ 1).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Now, let {a mathematical formula}J ′ be a pre-model of {a mathematical formula}KB such that {a mathematical formula}I ≤ Δ J ′ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since {a mathematical formula} Δ 1 ≺ Δ , it holds that {a mathematical formula}I ≤ Δ 1J ′ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Hence, either {a mathematical formula}NXJ ′ = ∅ or {a mathematical formula}NX ∉ satJ ′ ( Δ 1).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In particular, in the latter case {a mathematical formula}NX ∉ satJ ′ ( Δ ), because violating {a mathematical formula} Δ 1 implies violating Δ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We can then conclude that Δ is overridden in {a mathematical formula}NX/I.The case when {a mathematical formula} Δ 2 is overridden in {a mathematical formula}NX/I is entirely symmetric.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">It remains to treat the case when neither {a mathematical formula} Δ 1 nor {a mathematical formula} Δ 2 is overridden in {a mathematical formula}NX/I.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In that case, it holds that {a mathematical formula}NX ∈ satI( Δ 1) ∩ satI( Δ 2).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Hence, {a mathematical formula}NX ∈ satI( Δ ).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Putting the various cases together, we obtain that {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ KB Δ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">(RM) Let {a mathematical formula}KB={A ⊑ C,A ⊑ ¬E, Δ 1}, where {a mathematical formula} Δ 1=(C ⊑ nE).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We have that {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ 1.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Let {a mathematical formula} Δ 2=(C ⊑ n¬D) and {a mathematical formula} Δ =(C ⊓ D ⊑ nE).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">We show that {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ 2 and, contrary to Axiom (RM), {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ .</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">To do so, we exhibit a model {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}KB such that {a mathematical formula}I ⊭ KB Δ 2 and {a mathematical formula}I ⊭ KB Δ .</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Let {a mathematical formula}I be defined by {a mathematical formula} Δ I={x}, {a mathematical formula}NAI=AI=CI=DI={x}, whereas all other concepts are empty.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">A simple inspection of the proof of Theorem 8 shows that the rational closure properties that are not valid in {a mathematical formula}DLN are in sharp contrast with the idea of overriding as inconsistency with more specific axioms.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">{a mathematical formula}KB (i.e.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">there exists a {a mathematical formula}DLN model {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}KB such that {a mathematical formula}CI ≠ ∅ ) iff {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}C ⊑ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Similarly, {a mathematical formula}KB consistency will not be dealt with, because it can be reduced to checking whether {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} ⊤ ⊑ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Given any natural encoding of sets of sentences as strings, the size of a reasoning problem instance is defined as the length of the encoding of {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α }, where Α is the given query (a subsumption, an assertion, or a DI).</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The inference problems of many important description logics belong to deterministic time or space complexity classes {a mathematical formula}C ⊇ P (such as PSPACE or ExpTime) such that {a mathematical formula}PC equals {a mathematical formula}C. As a consequence, {a mathematical formula}DLN preserves their complexity:</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Although most of our results hold for unrestricted knowledge bases, the “ mainstream ” use of the strong part {a mathematical formula}S of {a mathematical formula}KB is specifying classically valid axioms that do not involve normality concepts, because such concepts are supposed to be defined by the DIs in {a mathematical formula}D. By adhering to this discipline, one obtains what we call a canonical knowledge base:</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">As a consequence, Default DLs cannot encode Example 12, because the range of role {a mathematical formula}has_organ consists of implicit individuals to which default rules do not apply.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Differently from {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin, they have a special inclusion operator for DIs but no equivalent of N. They satisfy the Rational closure axioms and are subject to inheritance blocking, like {a mathematical formula}ALC+Tmin (Example 6, Example 30 are not dealt with correctly).</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">These logics, introduced in [40], extend classical DLs with conditional constraints{a mathematical formula}(D|C)[l,u] whose intended meaning is: “ by default, the typical instances of C belong to D with probability {a mathematical formula}p ∈ [l,u] ” .</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">those that are subject to conditional constraints, are not allowed to occur in any axiom of the knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Accordingly, in the above knowledge base, a must necessarily be a “ classical ” individual that is not subject to any conditional constraint (while {a mathematical formula}DLN permits to use {a mathematical formula}{a} in the left-hand side of DIs, for all individuals a).</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">By analogy with the base case, it can be seen that {a mathematical formula}J is actually a {a mathematical formula}DLN interpretation, that {a mathematical formula}J is a pre-model of {a mathematical formula}KB, and that {a mathematical formula}J satisfies conditions 1 – 2 of Definition 1.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">So, in order to show that {a mathematical formula} Δ i is not overridden in {a mathematical formula}NC/I, we are only left to prove that {a mathematical formula}J satisfies also cond.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Suppose that{a mathematical formula}C ≡ Dis a (classically) valid equivalence and let{a mathematical formula}KB¯be a knowledge base obtained from{a mathematical formula}KB by replacing some occurrences of C with D. If ≺ is semantic, then</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Let {a mathematical formula}KB=S ∪ D.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">By Theorem 1, {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Α can be verified by constructing {a mathematical formula}KB Σ and checking whether {a mathematical formula}KB Σ ⊨ Α , where Σ is the set of normality concepts occurring in {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α } and hence{a mathematical formula} As a preliminary step, {a mathematical formula}D must be linearized according to the preference relation ≺ , using any standard sorting algorithm.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">By Lemma 2, Δ is not overridden in {a mathematical formula}NC iff {a mathematical formula}KB Σ ↓ ≺ Δ ∪ { Δ NC} ⊭ NC ⊑ ⊥ , where {a mathematical formula} Σ ={NC}.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Moreover, since the DIs of {a mathematical formula}KB are all mutually incomparable, and {a mathematical formula} Δ NC=NC ⊓ ⊤ ⊑ P¯i, we have that {a mathematical formula}KB Σ ↓ ≺ Δ ∪ { Δ NC} equals:{a mathematical formula} Therefore we have to prove that (A.10) does not entail {a mathematical formula}NC ⊑ ⊥ .The assumption {a mathematical formula}C ⋢ KBPi implies that there exists a pre-model {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}KB such that{a mathematical formula} Obtain another interpretation {a mathematical formula}J from {a mathematical formula}I by setting:{a mathematical formula} It can be easily verified that {a mathematical formula}J ⊨ S ∪ {NC ⊓ ⊤ ⊑ P¯i}, by construction.</a>
