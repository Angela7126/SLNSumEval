<a href="#0" id="0">Consider a direct application of PDBs to Sokoban.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A natural abstraction is to keep only {a mathematical formula}k ′ of all k stones.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is admissible, since the cost of solving a subset of stones never exceeds the cost of solving the whole instance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We can construct a PDB which stores the shortest distance to the nearest abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since in Sokoban the goal state is defined implicitly, every placement of the {a mathematical formula}k ′ stones on the k goal squares is an abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">2 shows the abstract goal states for a toy instance with {a mathematical formula}k=4 and {a mathematical formula}k ′ =2.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We call this PDB the multiple goal state PDB (MPDB).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider a decomposition of an instance into a maze zone and a goal zone, defined by some cut square.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The maze zone subproblem is to bring all stones in the maze zone to the cut square, where the capacity constraints of the cut square have been relaxed.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Suppose we know, for all subsets of squares {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ Q of size {a mathematical formula}k ′ and positions of the man m the minimum cost {a mathematical formula} Δ (P,m) of solving this subproblem with the {a mathematical formula}k ′ stones placed at squares P. (As explained above, these values are computed by an exhaustive backwards search and stored in a PDB.)</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As mentioned in the introduction, a natural approach for a PDB would be to use an abstraction that keeps only {a mathematical formula}k ′ of the k stones, and stores the distances to the nearest abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this case, every of the {a mathematical formula}(kk ′ ) possible placements of {a mathematical formula}k ′ stones on goal squares together with a reachable component for the man is an abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">2 shows an example of the set of abstract goal states for a small instance.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This is one of the main differences between IPDBs and MPDBs: an MPDB has a usually large number of goal states, whereas the IPDB has only one.</a>
