<a href="#0" id="0">Roughly speaking, in our approach, we consider a set of individuals S in a network to be a most influential set, with respect to a particular goal of interest, if S is the most preferred subset among all those that satisfy the following condition: were the individuals in S to choose the behavior {a mathematical formula}xS prescribed to them by a desired stable outcome {a mathematical formula}x ≡ (xS,x − S) which achieves the goal of interest, then the only stable outcome of the system that remains consistent with their choices {a mathematical formula}xS is x itself.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Said more intuitively, once the nodes in the most influential set S follow the behavior {a mathematical formula}xS prescribed to them by a desired stable outcome x achieving the goal of interest, they become collectively “ so influential ” that their behavior “ forces ” every other individual to a unique choice of behavior!</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In fact, it is unclear what the equivalent or analogous concept of the “ influence spread function ” is in our setting, given that we do not explicitly consider the dynamics by which stable outcomes may arise.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An example of a goal function g that captures the objective of achieving a specific stable outcome {a mathematical formula}x ⁎ ∈ NE(G) is {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ 1[x=x ⁎ ].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Another example that captures the objective of achieving a stable outcome with the largest number of individuals adopting the behavior 1 is {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ ∑ i=1nxi+12, or equivalently, {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ ∑ i=1nxi.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that both of the functions just presented ignore the set S. One alternative that does not is {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ ∑ i ∈ Stixi − ∑ i ∉ Stixi, where the {a mathematical formula}ti's reflect a weighted preference over individual nodes, thus capturing our interest in some “ weighted maximum set of adopters. ”</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Similar to the last objective function described in the previous paragraph, an alternative is {a mathematical formula}h(S) ≡ ∑ i ∈ Svi − ∑ i ∉ Svi, where the {a mathematical formula}vi's reflect a weighted preference over individual players in any set S that achieves the objective of interest.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In general, the influence factors {a mathematical formula}wji induce a (potentially completely-connected) directed graph, where nodes represent individuals/players, and therefore, we obtain a graphical game having a linear (in the number of edges) representation size, as opposed to the exponential (in the maximum degree of a node) representation size of general graphical games in normal form [46].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note however that this adaptation is exclusive to a very specific instance of our general problem formulation: identifying “ most influential nodes ” with respect to the goal being maximizing the number of +1's in the PSNE (see Definition 3.6 in Section 3.2 for a definition and discussion of our problem formulation and the role that the “ objective function ” {a mathematical formula}g(.)</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore, in this paper, we only adapt the popular, greedy algorithm used to find the “ most influential individuals ” in the cascade model, as described in Kleinberg[49], to use as a heuristic to solve what would be the equivalent/analogous instance of that problem in the more general problem formulation in our setting presented in Section 3.2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In particular, for the diffusion-based heuristic, at each iteration, we select a node u that achieves the “ maximum spread ” of action 1, by which we mean the node u that leads to the largest (marginal difference in the) number of other players in the network with action 1 after performing best-response dynamics in the LIG; force u to adopt action 1; and let all but the previously selected nodes modify their actions as best responses to u's adoption of action 1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Given the set {a mathematical formula}S of all stable outcomes (i.e., PSNE) and a subset of {a mathematical formula}C of these stable outcomes, find a minimal set T of players such that{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}PS(V) is the set of PSNE-extensions of the nodes in V playing action 1, i.e.,{a mathematical formula}</a>
