<a href="#0" id="0">Given {a mathematical formula}s ∈ SA, the transition function {a mathematical formula}s ′ = Ξ (s,A) is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} We say that A is executable if {a mathematical formula}SA ≠ ∅ or, equivalently, if{a mathematical formula} Sets of actions that are not executable do not play any role in our analysis as they will never appear in executable plans (see below for the exact definition).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For this reason, in our analysis, we always restrict consideration to executable sets of actions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This implies, in particular, that each single action a that we consider satisfies the condition {a mathematical formula}Prea+ ∩ Prea − = ∅ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The weight of the instance {a mathematical formula} Γ 1 in some state s is how many of the atoms in {a mathematical formula} Γ 1(Tft) are true in s. For example, {a mathematical formula}w( Γ 1,s0)=1 for the plausible initial state {an inline-figure}, because the intersection of the state {a mathematical formula}s0 and the instantiation {a mathematical formula} Γ 1(Tft) contains just clear(tile1).We will see that we can actually prove that {a mathematical formula}Tft is an invariant, which states that any given tile (e.g., tile1 for the instance/instantiation {a mathematical formula} Γ 1) satisfies at most one of: (1) clear, (2) painted a colour, or (3) occupied by a robot.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The sets {a mathematical formula}A2, … ,An − 1, as well as {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}An, possibly contain other actions that are executed over the duration of Da.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, it is convenient to consider general sequences of actions {a mathematical formula}A=(A1,A2, … ,An) without referring to plans or durative actions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, in this section, we first give a definition of safety for A such that, when A is executed serially in any executable plan Π , if the weight constraint is not violated in the state where the sequence is initially applied, it is not violated in any intermediate step and at the end of the sequence.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note that this also shows that {a mathematical formula}Ati does not contain actions in {a mathematical formula}GAend( Γ ) for any {a mathematical formula}i ∈ (h,k) (as the corresponding start fragment cannot happen either before or after time {a mathematical formula}th).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, {a mathematical formula}Ati is Γ -irrelevant for every {a mathematical formula}i ∈ (h,k) because of (iii) of Definition 52.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore A satisfies properties (a) and (b) contrarily to the assumptions made on Da.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Precisely, if {a mathematical formula}a=gr( Α ), it follows from the definition of {a mathematical formula}a Γ (see Remark 15) that:{a mathematical formula} Considering that, by Proposition 16, a is strongly Γ -safe if and only if {a mathematical formula}a Γ is also strongly Γ -safe, the property of strong safety of an action schema Α does not depend on the formulas in Α that do not match {a mathematical formula}T. Hence, in principle, such a property should be analysed by studying the restrictions of Α to the different {a mathematical formula}T-classes L of matching formulas.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This intuition leads to the following definition.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We can estimate this term with the product {a mathematical formula} Ω ⋅ |C| where Ω is the maximum number of formulas in any schema that shares the same relation and {a mathematical formula}|C| is the cardinality of the template's component set {a mathematical formula}C. We deduce that all safety checks for individual schemas (both the instantaneous and the durative ones) have a computational complexity of the order of {a mathematical formula}M ⋅ |A| ⋅ Ω ⋅ |C|, where M is the maximum number of formulas appearing in any schema and {a mathematical formula}|A| is the total number of schemas.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Consequently, this is the computational complexity of Corollary 74, Corollary 98 that only involve safety checks.</a>
