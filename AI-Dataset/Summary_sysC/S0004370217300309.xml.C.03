<a href="#0" id="0">Given a set of diagnoses Ω and a probability function over them p, we can derive a health state as follows{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}1C ∈ Ω is the indicator function defined as:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Instead of repairing the components in the diagnoses ordered by their probabilities, the health state wasted effort metric considers repairing components order by their probabilities in the health state.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We define the wasted effort metric of a health state H as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula} Ω i be the set of the first i diagnoses returned by the DA, and let {a mathematical formula}Hi to be the health state generated from the diagnoses in {a mathematical formula} Ω i.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We say that the health state has converged after i diagnoses if {a mathematical formula}Hi is stable, where a stable health state is defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As an example, Table 5 lists the health state obtained for every {a mathematical formula} Ω i for our running example from Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The first clear trend we observe in these results is that it is possible to converge to a Ε -stable health state without finding all diagnoses even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The wasted effort cost for the health state generated from all diagnoses (the {a mathematical formula} Ε =0 line) is 0.18.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Now consider the health state for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The health state generated from the diagnoses found until convergence according to the Euclidean distance has a wasted effort cost of 0.44 – much worse than the 0.18 for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">By contrast health state generated for the AUC metric has a wasted effort cost of 0.19 – almost the same as the wasted effort cost for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This is especially surprising, since the convergence rate for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.5 is 0.08, i.e., only 8% of the diagnoses are needed to create a health state that has only 0.01 more wasted effort cost than the health state generated by all diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For example, the value 0.82 for system 74181 and {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 in Table 9 is the AUC value of the health state obtained by halting the diagnosis process when reaching a Ε -stable health state for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The fact that using all diagnoses is relatively close to the Oracle value is especially interesting because the results also show that with {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 we get a health state that is almost the same as for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0, and consequently to the Oracle value.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The last health state is calculated based on having all previous diagnoses and a new diagnosis that had the minimal number of faulty components.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As can be seen, even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1, only a fraction of the minimal cardinality diagnoses are needed to reach a Ε -stable health state.</a>
