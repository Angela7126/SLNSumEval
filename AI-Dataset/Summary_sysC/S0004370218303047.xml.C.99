<a href="#0" id="0">We have so far considered that the input is a string encoding a Bayesian network specification {a mathematical formula}B, a query {a mathematical formula}(Q,E), and a rational number Γ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However in practice one may face a situation where the Bayesian network is fixed, and the input is a string consisting of the pair {a mathematical formula}(Q,E) and a rational number Γ ; the goal is to determine whether {a mathematical formula}P(Q|E)> Γ with respect to the fixed Bayesian network.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Denote by {a mathematical formula}QINF[B], where {a mathematical formula}B is a Bayesian network specification, the language consisting of each string {a mathematical formula}(Q,E, Γ ) for which {a mathematical formula}P(Q|E)> Γ with respect to {a mathematical formula}B.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">And denote by {a mathematical formula}QINF[L] the set of languages {a mathematical formula}QINF[B] where {a mathematical formula}B is a Bayesian network specification with definition axioms whose bodies are formulas in {a mathematical formula}L.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To state this result precisely, consider a relational Bayesian network specification {a mathematical formula}S based on {a mathematical formula}DLLitenf, a set of assignments E for ground atoms, and a domain size N. Denote by X the set of random variables that correspond to groundings of relations in {a mathematical formula}S. Now there is at least one set of assignments M such that: (i) M contains assignments to all random variables in X that are not mentioned in E; and (ii) {a mathematical formula}P(M,E) is maximum over all such sets of assignments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We collect all these assignments in a set E. Note that E in effect “ creates ” all the desired definition axioms by selecting two instances of X per instance of Y.Note that if we enforce {a mathematical formula}{Y(x)=1} for all {a mathematical formula}x, we obtain the same construction used in the proof of Theorem 2, we one difference: in that proof we had 3m variables {a mathematical formula}Xij, while here we have N variables {a mathematical formula}X(x) (note that {a mathematical formula}N ≥ 3m, and in fact {a mathematical formula}N>3m for {a mathematical formula}m>1).Consider grounding this relational Bayesian network specification and computing{a mathematical formula} This distribution is encoded by a Bayesian network with nodes {a mathematical formula}X(1), … ,X(N) and nodes {a mathematical formula}Y(1), … ,Y(N), where all nodes {a mathematical formula}Z(x,y) are removed as they are set by E; also, each node {a mathematical formula}Y(x) has two parents, and all nodes {a mathematical formula}X(3m+1), … ,X(N) have no children.</a>
