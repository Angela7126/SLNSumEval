<a href="#0" id="0">To learn the issue weight values and individual utility function, a two layered architecture would be essential.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, in order to overcome the aforementioned difficulties and to justify the features outlined above, a new model based on perceptron units is proposed here for an agent with incomplete information, in order to model the preference profile of the opponent in bilateral multi issue negotiations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Regression analysis models assume that the bidding strategy of the opponent could be defined by a formula with unknown parameters; that is, the problem of estimating the bidding strategy of the opponent could be easily reduced to the regression analysis on the utility values of the received offers from the opponent in the agent's own utility space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, according to the underlying scheme in which they are applied to extract the opponent's preferences, the existing state of the art opponent models (which use a common negotiation setting for estimating the preference order of the negotiation outcomes and are designed and implemented in the Genius framework [36], [37] in the ANAC tournaments) could be categorized into the following [38]:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In other words, the preference profile of an agent is modeled as a linear combination of a set of weights (which measures the relative importance of the negotiation issues) and a number of individual utility functions (or evaluation functions) which calculate the utility of a possible value for a negotiation issue.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this algorithm, instead of updating each {a mathematical formula}evaliOP( Ω i) and {a mathematical formula}wiOP value after calculating all {a mathematical formula} Δ wi and {a mathematical formula} Δ evaliOP values when all training examples are met, each {a mathematical formula}evaliOP( Ω i) and {a mathematical formula}wiOP value is modified using training delta rules right after each single training instance is met in an incremental manner (Algorithm: lines 18, 21).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, this algorithm can easily be applied in more realistic negotiation scenarios in which training examples (opponent offers) are gradually met one at a time.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The problem of preference modeling in bilateral multi issue negotiations through supervised learning methods can be separated in two sub-problems: 1) estimating the utility values of the opponent's offer history (the history of the offers received from the opponent through the negotiation session) and 2) extracting the estimated utility function (or the preference profile) of the opponent from the opponent's offer history.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Applying the constant values for estimating the utility value of the bids received from the opponent may seem simplistic at first, but actually it is not.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As explained in Section 1, the opponent modeling problem in negotiation is a specific type of a learning problem, where all of the training examples are not provided in advance, but are provided throughout the negotiation session in an incremental manner.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">From the four classes above, the second contains opponents with random or non-deterministic behavior, while the others comprise deterministic opponents.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Consequently, the experiment involves a total of 15 opponents, among which 4 opponents (in the first class) are predictable, and the remaining 11 are unpredictable.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As mentioned in Section 1, all of the existing models apply a subset of assumptions on the bidding strategy or on the value distribution of the issues of the opponent's preference profile.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In the setting adopted in Experiment I (Section 5.1.1), the accuracy of this proposed model is evaluated together with other opponent models through a Pearson Correlation between the estimated and real bid utilities [38]:{a mathematical formula} where, {a mathematical formula}uOP is the real utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ is the estimated utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP( Ω → ) is the real utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space, and {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ ( Ω → ) is the estimated utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space.</a>
