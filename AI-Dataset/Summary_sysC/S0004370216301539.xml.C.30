<a href="#0" id="0">A planning problem {a mathematical formula}P ˜ with respect to an incomplete domain model {a mathematical formula}D ˜ and a set of typed objects O is defined as {a mathematical formula}P ˜ = 〈 F,A,I,G 〉 where F is the set of propositions instantiated from predicates {a mathematical formula}R and objects O, A is the set of actions instantiated from {a mathematical formula}O and O, {a mathematical formula}I ⊆ F is the initial state, and {a mathematical formula}G ⊆ F is the set of goal propositions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In a specific complete model {a mathematical formula}D, actions instantiated from one operator have the same realized preconditions and effects.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The complete sets of preconditions and effects for action {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A in complete model {a mathematical formula}D are denoted by {a mathematical formula}PreD(a), {a mathematical formula}AddD(a) and {a mathematical formula}DelD(a).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given an incomplete domain model {a mathematical formula}D ˜ , problem {a mathematical formula}P ˜ and plan {a mathematical formula} Π = 〈 a1,...,an 〉 , a naive approach to compute the robustness of Π is to enumerate all domain models {a mathematical formula}D ∈ 《 D ˜ 》 and check for the success of Π with respect to {a mathematical formula}D. This is prohibitively expensive when the number of possible preconditions and effects is large.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula} Σ Π be the set of all constraints above.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For each assignment Σ for variables Z, we denote {a mathematical formula}D Σ ∈ 《 D ˜ 》 as the candidate domain model in which the realization of possible preconditions and effects is determined by the truth assignment for variables {a mathematical formula}Z ˜ in Σ .</a>
