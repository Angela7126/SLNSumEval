<a href="#0" id="0">Given a distance metric d, a profile Π , and that {a mathematical formula}d( Π , Σ ⁎ ) ≤ t, we can bound {a mathematical formula}k(t, Π ) using the diameter of the set of possible ground truths {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For a set of rankings {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ L(A), denote its diameter by {a mathematical formula}D(S)=max Σ , Σ ′ ∈ S ⁡ d( Σ , Σ ′ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given n noisy rankings at an average distance of at most t from an unknown true ranking{a mathematical formula} Σ ⁎ according to a distance metric d, it is always possible to find a ranking at distance at most 2t from{a mathematical formula} Σ ⁎ according to d.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If {a mathematical formula}d ↓ (t)=0, then the result trivially holds.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assume {a mathematical formula}d ↓ (t)>0.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ be two rankings at distance {a mathematical formula}d ↓ (t).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consider profile Π consisting of only a single instance of ranking Σ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Then, {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ ∈ Bt( Π ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence, {a mathematical formula}D(Bt( Π )) ≥ d ↓ (t).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Now, it follows from Lemma 1 that {a mathematical formula}k(t) ≥ D(Bt( Π ))/2 ≥ d ↓ (t)/2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">First, we show that {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ Bt( Π ) only if equality in Equation (5) holds.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To see why, note that the footrule distance is always even and {a mathematical formula}r=dFR ↓ (2t) ≥ ⌊ 2t ⌋ − 1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Hence, if equality is not achieved, then {a mathematical formula}dFR( Ρ , Σ )+dFR( Ρ , Σ ′ ) ≥ r+2 ≥ ⌊ 2t ⌋ − 1+1>2t.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence, the average distance of Ρ from votes in Π would be greater than t.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Consider the profile Π consisting of {a mathematical formula}n/2 instances of Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ each.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Clearly, Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ have an average distance of {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ /2 ≤ t from rankings in Π .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Hence, {a mathematical formula}{ Σ , Σ ′ } ∈ Bt( Π ).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Surprisingly, in this case we can show that the minimax distance of {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) without any additional information regarding the structure of {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Take a ranking {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ L(A).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The alternative placed first in Ρ must be ranked at a position {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ or below in at least one of Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Hence, {a mathematical formula}max ⁡ (dMD( Ρ , Σ ),dMD( Ρ , Σ ′ )) ≥ ⌊ 2t ⌋ .</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Thus, there exists a ranking in {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) at distance at least {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ from Ρ , i.e., the minimax distance of {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) is at least {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ , as desired.</a>
