<a href="#0" id="0">In the following, {a mathematical formula}T and {a mathematical formula}S respectively refer to the set of tasks and shifts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It includes a set of 5 tasks {a mathematical formula}T={t1,..,t5} and a set of 5 shifts {a mathematical formula}S={s1,..,s5}.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}St1={s2,s3,s4}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}LB ≠ =3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">An optimal solution involving shifts {a mathematical formula}{s1,s2,s3} is given in Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The SMPTSP can be formulated within CP with a set of {a mathematical formula}|T| integer variables {a mathematical formula}X and one objective variable z.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The filtering algorithm proposed in [7] stems from the search of a maximum independent set in {a mathematical formula}GI(X).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let the number of variables and the number of values be respectively referred to as {a mathematical formula}n=|X| and {a mathematical formula}l=|S|.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">2, with {a mathematical formula}d(z)={1}.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Based on this new graph, if we assume that {a mathematical formula}x1 and {a mathematical formula}x5 are then used as a new independent set (Fig.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Consequently, {a mathematical formula}AI is an independent set in {a mathematical formula}GCI.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Note that a maximum independent set in {a mathematical formula}GI, is not necessarily maximal in {a mathematical formula}GCI.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Thus, using {a mathematical formula}GCI is presumably better than using {a mathematical formula}GI to filter AtMostNValue when difference constraints figure in the model (Proposition 2).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To illustrate the interest of {a mathematical formula}GCI, we now use it on our example, with {a mathematical formula}d(z)={1,2,3}, in Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For instance, if we consider the independent set {a mathematical formula}{x1,x2,x3} (Fig.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Consequently, {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 GCI|O|R2 〉 is stronger than {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 GI|O|R2 〉 .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Consequently, {a mathematical formula}A ∪ {i} is a valid independent set in {a mathematical formula}GCI.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">This way, it is possible to filter the domain of the variable {a mathematical formula}xa of the independent set as well.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">4a), because the set of values induced by the independent set is {a mathematical formula}{1,2,3,4,5}.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">However, {a mathematical formula}R3 (Fig.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 GCI|H|R3 〉 is strictly stronger than {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 GCI|H|R2 〉 .</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">If this filtering occurs while considering an independent set of {a mathematical formula}A1 ∩ A2, then the same filtering is performed by {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 GCI|F1|R1,3 〉 .</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Else, this filtering occurs when considering an independent set {a mathematical formula}I2 of {a mathematical formula}A2 ∖ A1.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Thus, {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 GCI|F1|R1,3 〉 is stronger than {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 GCI|F2|R1,3 〉 .</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The {a mathematical formula}Rk heuristic performs k iterations, each one computes an independent set randomly.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">However, the filtering of {a mathematical formula}AMNV 〈 G|F|R 〉 is related to the lower bounding of the problem.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">On Data_100, the use of {a mathematical formula}GCI allows to get values of {a mathematical formula}z ̲ r that are more than twice {a mathematical formula}LB ≠ .</a>
