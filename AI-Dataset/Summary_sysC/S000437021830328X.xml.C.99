<a href="#0" id="0">Properties of interplay Note that {a mathematical formula}w ⊩ HC Φ means that coalition C has the same strategy to achieve Φ in all epistemic states indistinguishable by the coalition from state w. Hence, the following principle is universally true:{a mathematical formula} Similarly, {a mathematical formula}w ⊩ ¬HC Φ means that coalition C does not have the same strategy to achieve Φ in all epistemic states indistinguishable by the coalition from state w. Thus,{a mathematical formula} We call properties (3) and (4)strategic positive introspection and strategic negative introspection, respectively.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Coalition C can even use a strategy that simultaneously achieves another result in addition to Φ :{a mathematical formula} In our logical system we use an equivalent form of the above principle that is stated using only implication:{a mathematical formula} We call this property epistemic determinicity principle.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section we present the formal syntax and semantics of our logical system given a fixed finite set of agents {a mathematical formula}A. Epistemic transition system could be thought of as a Kripke model of modal logic S5 with distributed knowledge to which we add transitions controlled by a vote aggregation mechanism.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By Definition 7, it suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}w ′ ⊩ Ψ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Indeed, assumption {a mathematical formula}w → sw ′ , by Definition 6, implies that {a mathematical formula}w → s1w ′ and {a mathematical formula}w → s2w ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, {a mathematical formula}w ′ ⊩ Φ → Ψ and {a mathematical formula}w ′ ⊩ Φ by the choice of strategies {a mathematical formula}s1 and {a mathematical formula}s2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}w ′ ⊩ Ψ by Definition 7.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Although the proof follows the outline of the proof of Lemma 26 for modality {a mathematical formula}KC, it is significantly more involved because of the need to show that a transition from a parent node to a child node satisfies the constraints of the vote aggregation mechanism from Definition 13.</a>
