<a href="#0" id="0">Thus, the plan compiler produces a QCP that contains feasible state and control input trajectory sets for the linearized abstraction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When event A is executed at {a mathematical formula}T=0, the dispatcher propagates the effect based on the temporal constraints in the dispatchable plan, resulting in an execution window of [1, 10] for event B, and [6, 20] for event C.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">3, the dispatcher decides to execute event B at time {a mathematical formula}T=7.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Multi-Parametric Programming uses a linear discrete time formulation, where plant dynamics are represented by{a mathematical formula} and state and actuation constraints are represented by{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}x(k) ∈ ℜ n is the state vector, and {a mathematical formula}u(k) ∈ ℜ m is the input vector, and A and B are constant matrices.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This control policy specifies z as a linear function of the initial state {a mathematical formula}x(0).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The algorithm accomplishes this by choosing an initial feasible state, {a mathematical formula}x(0), and determining a polytope about this state within which a particular control policy is optimal.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The flexibility provided by state and temporal constraints in the QSP allows the executive to consider multiple possible state and control input sequences, and to choose the most appropriate one given the situation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We call a state and input trajectory, {a mathematical formula} 〈 x(t),u(t) 〉 , a Mode Feasible Trajectory with respect to M if it satisfies the dynamics and actuation constraints of L, as specified in Definition 2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">4, the goal region constraint {a mathematical formula}CM ∈ r1 represents the requirement that the CM trajectory must be in region {a mathematical formula}r1 for the CM movement activity to finish successfully.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Qualitative State PlanA Qualitative State Plan (QSP) is a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 E,A,C 〉 , where E is a set of Events, A is a set of Activities, and C is a set (conjunction) of externally imposed temporal constraints on the start and finish times of the activities.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}x(t) must satisfy the initial and goal region state constraints of a.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}x(t) must satisfy the operating state constraints of a.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Temporally Feasible ActivityGiven an activity and associated plant, the activity is Temporally Feasible in the duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u] if{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">More specifically, if a trajectory starting anywhere in the initial region, {a mathematical formula}Rinit, of the activity (see Definition 8) and ending somewhere in the goal region, {a mathematical formula}Rgoal, at any duration d such that {a mathematical formula}l ≤ d ≤ u, is Plant Feasible, then the activity is temporally feasible in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Temporally Controllable ActivityGiven an activity and associated plant, and given a Valid Control Policy, P, for the activity, the activity is Temporally Controllable by P in the duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u] if the activity is Temporally Feasible in this range, and if all trajectories for the activity are consistent with (generated by) P. A trajectory is consistent with, or generated by P if for every state {a mathematical formula}x(k) in the trajectory, the subsequent state {a mathematical formula}x(k+1) results from applying P to {a mathematical formula}x(k).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The duration range {a mathematical formula}[li,ui] for each activity {a mathematical formula}ai is a temporal constraint on the activity.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">QCPA Qualitative Control Plan (QCP) is a triple {a mathematical formula} 〈 E,Ac,Ct 〉 , where E is a set of events (Definition 7), {a mathematical formula}Ct is a set of temporal constraints on the events (Definition 10), and {a mathematical formula}Ac is a set of control activities (Definition 18).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For the case of the last cross section before the goal, the new state requirement is {a mathematical formula}xnew ∈ Rgoal, where {a mathematical formula}Rgoal is the goal region specified for the activity in the QSP.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">For example, suppose the current state of a linearized sub-system corresponding to a control activity is x.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Suppose, further, that this state is in the region of a cross section, {a mathematical formula}cd(x ∈ Rs(cd)), as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In this case, the control input {a mathematical formula}u=Fjx+Gj is applied to the linearized sub-system over the next time increment.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Using the linearized, discretized plant dynamics, this results in a new state {a mathematical formula}xnew=Aix+Biu in the next time increment.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In a control activity, if the valid region of a cross section,{a mathematical formula}cd, for duration d increments is empty, then there are no valid trajectories for the activity with duration d increments or greater.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">If there is no overlap between the valid initial region of an activity, and a valid cross section corresponding to duration d, then there is no way for the activity to start from {a mathematical formula}Rs(cd), because the initial region constraint is violated.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">However, unlike discrete activity systems, which can simply set the occurrence of events so that they coincide with target completion times, our dispatcher must generate control inputs that guide the hybrid plant to its goal state at the target completion time.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Valid Control Policy for Target Completion TimeA Valid Control Policy that results in achievement of an activity's goal state at time {a mathematical formula}tf is denoted by {a mathematical formula}P(tf); it is a Valid Control Policy with respect to the target completion time {a mathematical formula}tf.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Temporally Controllable Activity for Target Completion Time and Current StateAn activity is Temporally Controllable for Target Completion Time {a mathematical formula}tf from current state x if there exists a Valid Control Policy for Target Completion Time, {a mathematical formula}P(tf), that covers x.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">We call this a Valid Control Policy for Target Completion Time and State, and denote this by {a mathematical formula}P(tf,x).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">During initialization, the dispatcher chooses a goal duration (and target completion time) for the control activity that is consistent with its execution window, and computes an initial control input, based on the control policy for the chosen target completion time.</a>
