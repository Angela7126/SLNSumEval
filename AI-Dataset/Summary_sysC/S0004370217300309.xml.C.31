<a href="#0" id="0">The first clear trend we observe in these results is that it is possible to converge to a Ε -stable health state without finding all diagnoses even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, consider the convergence rate results when using the AUC metric for system 74181.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Only 17% of the diagnoses are needed to generate a health state that is at most 0.1 far from the health state generated from all diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This suggests that intelligent DAs can halt early without significant loss in health state quality.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This conclusion is also supported by the software diagnosis results (shown in Table 8).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When considering the “ All ” results, the wasted effort having all diagnoses is 0.05, while it is only increased by 0.01 even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.5.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The fact that using all diagnoses is relatively close to the Oracle value is especially interesting because the results also show that with {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 we get a health state that is almost the same as for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0, and consequently to the Oracle value.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This is important because as shown in Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, the Ε -stable health state for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 is generated from a small portion of the entire set of diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This demonstrates the potential benefit of a smart DA that will halt early the search for diagnoses but still end up with a high quality health state.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">More generally, our conclusions from the analysis so far are:</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Moreover, a high-quality health state can be found with only a subset of all minimal cardinality diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Table 13, Table 14 show the ratio of minimal cardinality diagnoses (where 1 corresponds to all minimal cardinality diagnoses) required on average, to reach a Ε -stable health state using AUC and Euclidean metrics respectively.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As can be seen, even for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1, only a fraction of the minimal cardinality diagnoses are needed to reach a Ε -stable health state.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For example, only 17% of the minimal cardinality diagnoses are needed to generate a health state that is Ε -stable for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 for the 74181 system under the Euclidean distance metric (Table 14).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Note that the values are normalized by the total number of the minimal cardinality diagnoses and therefore they are higher than the values presented in Table 6, Table 7 which are normalized by all diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Although the proposed online stopping condition is very simple, the results in Table 15, Table 16 show that the resulting values for {a mathematical formula} Δ =0.1 are almost exactly the same as those obtained for health states generated from all diagnoses ({a mathematical formula} Δ =0).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In some cases, the health state obtained by the online stopping condition is even better than the health state of all diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The health state found when using the online stopping is also comparable to the quality obtained by the Ε -stable health state for {a mathematical formula} Ε =0.1 (presented in Table 9, Table 10).</a>
