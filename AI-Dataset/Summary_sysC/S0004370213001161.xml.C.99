<a href="#1" id="1">⊆ ) let us assume that some {a mathematical formula}S ∈ PEXT is not maximal.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From the actions of line 14 in Algorithm 2 this implies that there exists an admissible set {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊃ S s.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast, Algorithm 2 selects an argument, x, labelled BLANK on the bases we have discussed earlier.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, the selection process of MC may take up to {a mathematical formula}|R|2 steps while that of Algorithm 2 requires no more than {a mathematical formula}|R|.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A further, significant difference is that CAYCred selects an argument to be PRO arbitrarily while Algorithm 3 uses a heuristic rule to choose which BLANK argument to expand the search structure.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">So, the expected running time is improved: empirical confirmation being provided by the experiments reported in Section 6.4.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As to the UNDEC label, the objective is to discriminate, and then to avoid, those arguments that previously failed to be in an admissible set with the current PRO arguments.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To accomplish this let us first define the set of critical total value orders, denoted by {a mathematical formula}U ′ , which is basically a subset of the set of all specific audiences {a mathematical formula}U.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In fact, {a mathematical formula}U ′ is the set of total orders that Algorithm 5 investigates for enumerating preferred extensions as we will establish later.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Assume{a mathematical formula} By Algorithm 5, lines 12 and 14{a mathematical formula} By Proposition 5 (which basically states the conditions under which an argument is labelled IN or left BLANK by Algorithm 6) and after simplification{a mathematical formula} This contradicts the definition of {a mathematical formula}U ′ (Definition 7): recall that {a mathematical formula}U ′ contains total value orders including those which satisfy the previous implication.</a>
