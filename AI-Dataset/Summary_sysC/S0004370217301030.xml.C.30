<a href="#0" id="0">In the following, we give a brief overview on abstract argumentation, the computational problems considered in the competition, and some brief overviews on answer set programming and satisfiability solving.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Abstract argumentation frameworkAn abstract argumentation framework{a mathematical formula}AF is a tuple {a mathematical formula}AF=(Arg, → ) where {a mathematical formula}Arg is a set of arguments and → is a relation {a mathematical formula} → ⊆ Arg×Arg.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Semantics are usually given to abstract argumentation frameworks by means of extensions [35].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An extension E of an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Arg, → ) is a set of arguments {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ Arg that gives some coherent view on the argumentation underlying {a mathematical formula}AF.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A set of arguments {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ Arg is a grounded extension (GR) iff it is complete and E is minimal with respect to set inclusion.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A set of arguments {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ Arg is a preferred extension (PR) iff it is complete and E is maximal with respect to set inclusion.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">24 small-sized argumentation graphs from generator A (test set 1)</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">24 medium-sized argumentation graphs from generator A (test set 2)</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">24 large-sized argumentation graphs from generator A (test set 3)</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">24 small-sized argumentation graphs from generator B (test set 4)</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">24 medium-sized argumentation graphs from generator B (test set 5)</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">24 small-sized argumentation graphs from generator C (test set 6)</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">24 medium-sized argumentation graphs from generator C (test set 7)</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The aim of the competition was to measure and compare the computational performance of the submitted solvers on solving instances of the problems presented in Section 2.3.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For the problems SE (compute some extension) and EE (compute all extensions) we used every one of the 192 argumentation graphs (see previous section) as an individual instance for each semantics.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For the problems DS (decide skeptical acceptance) and DC (decide credulous acceptance) we randomly selected three arguments from every argumentation graph, yielding in total 576 instances for each semantics.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The ASPARTIX-D solver (Answer Set Programming Argumentation Reasoning Tool – Dresden version) [54] is a collection of ASP encodings together with dedicated solvers to solve all tasks of the competition wrt.</a>
