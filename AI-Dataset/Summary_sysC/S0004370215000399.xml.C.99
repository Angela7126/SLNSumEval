<a href="#0" id="0">Nevertheless, since there does not exist a similarity measure works better than all the other ones in every scenario, an alignment system typically calculates the similarity between a pair of entities from two different ontologies by means of a set of multiple similarity techniques, and the obtained similarity values are combined in a unique similarity measure.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">During the process of evolution, since our approach utilize UIR to ensure the consistent improvement of recall and precision of the individuals, it is potentially more likely to find better solution than the approach without using UIR.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, through the comparison of the results obtained by one pairs of ontologies using two approaches, MA using both MatchFmeasure and UIR is effective.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As Table 4 shows, except for case number 1, {a mathematical formula}SB is better than {a mathematical formula}SA in the rest cases.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From the third column, {a mathematical formula}SB is apparently better than {a mathematical formula}SA in case numbers 5, 7, 8 and 9.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">While according to the values in the fourth and fifth columns, {a mathematical formula}SB is apparently better than {a mathematical formula}SA in case numbers 2, 3 and 6.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, by comparing the fitness of {a mathematical formula}SB with that of {a mathematical formula}SA, {a mathematical formula}SB is better than {a mathematical formula}SA in case number 4.</a>
