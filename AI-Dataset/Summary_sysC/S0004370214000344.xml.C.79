<a href="#0" id="0">That is, the trust assigned to {a mathematical formula}Informant2 is higher than the trust assigned to {a mathematical formula}Informant1; hence, in our proposal, the reliability of a piece of information will reflect the credibility assigned to the informant.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Credibility order – credibility tupleGiven a finite set of informants {a mathematical formula}A, a credibility order over {a mathematical formula}A is a binary relation on {a mathematical formula}A called {a mathematical formula}O{a mathematical formula}(O ⊆ A×A).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Observe that the definition establishes that in a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[T,S] the source S cannot be in any place in T. A discussion considering the reasons for having this restriction is included in Section 9.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, the function Cl defined below, characterizes the agent's strict partial order as the transitive closure of the set of credibility tuples that are contained in the credibility objects of {a mathematical formula}C.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, given a sound credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, {a mathematical formula}Cl(C) represents the credibility strict partial order that the agent will use to compare informants.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As it will be explained in detail below, when an agent A receives a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[(B,C),I] which does not generate cycles in his current credibility base (i.e., {a mathematical formula}(C,B) ∉ Cl(CA)), then {a mathematical formula}[(B,C),I] can be added to {a mathematical formula}CA and the resulting credibility base will be sound.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">With this problem in mind, in the following sections we will define a change theory for credibility bases giving the agents the capability of changing the strict partial order relation that represents the trust on their peers.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The main task of a contraction operator is to obtain a new credibility base {a mathematical formula}C ′ in which {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∉ Cl(C ′ ), losing as little information as possible.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A particular case of expansion occurs when a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C is expanded by a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[T,A] which is already in {a mathematical formula}C. In this case, expanding {a mathematical formula}C by {a mathematical formula}[T,A] does not generate any change in {a mathematical formula}C. The name vacuity follows the tradition of belief revision literature, showing a case in which the expansion operator does not change anything.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let {a mathematical formula}(D,E) be a credibility tuple that we would like to eliminate from {a mathematical formula}C. We say that a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] of {a mathematical formula}C is safe with respect to contraction by {a mathematical formula}(D,E) in {a mathematical formula}C if and only if every path from D to E either does not contain {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H], or the path contains some credibility object {a mathematical formula}[(I,J),K] with {a mathematical formula}(K,H) ∈ Cl(C).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">That is to say, {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] is safe with respect to contraction by {a mathematical formula}(D,E) in {a mathematical formula}C if and only if there is no path from D to E that contains {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H], or for every path P from D to E that contains {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] then P does contain some credibility object whose source is less credible than H according to {a mathematical formula}C. In the rest of the paper, and only when no confusion arises, we will sometimes write “ is safe ” instead of “ is safe with respect to contraction by{a mathematical formula}(D,E)in{a mathematical formula}C ” .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The CR-contraction operator that we will define below is based on the contraction of a credibility order by a credibility tuple {a mathematical formula}(A,B) proposed in [47].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Although our contraction operator can produce a change that is not minimal with respect to the number of credibility objects in the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, the change is minimal as discussed in [27].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Next, we will give a construction of the prioritized revision operator for credibility bases, called C-revision using reliability (or CR-revision for short), denoted “ {a mathematical formula} ⊛ Σ ↓ ” .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The basic task of our prioritized operator is to construct a new credibility base in which {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ Cl(C) but {a mathematical formula}(B,A) ∉ Cl(C).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">When a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C ∈ C is revised by a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[(A,B),S] there exist two tasks:</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">However, if inconsistency arises, i.e., {a mathematical formula}(B,A) ∈ Cl(C), then the proper credibility base (no other structure is necessary) is used to decide which information prevails.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Based on a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, we will define a function {a mathematical formula}Rl((A,B),C) that given a credibility tuple {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ Cl(C), returns a set of agent identifiers that represent the reliability of {a mathematical formula}(A,B) with respect to {a mathematical formula}C. Recall that the function Sources returns a set of agent identifiers (Definition 16) and that {a mathematical formula}C(A − B) represents the set of all paths from A to B.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The first case in Definition 18 states that when no contradiction arises the input is accepted and added (expansion).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The second case states that if a contradiction arises ({a mathematical formula}(B,A) ∈ Cl(C)) then the input will be accepted and added if every agent returned by {a mathematical formula}Rl((B,A),C) is less credible than S. The third case states that the input is rejected when there exists some agent identifier returned by Rl that is incomparable with S or more credible than S.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">generalized in [28] the idea of screened revision considering a set of credible sentences {a mathematical formula}C. This work presents different properties for {a mathematical formula}C, different constructions, and their respective representation theorems in epistemic models based on belief sets or possible worlds.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Let {a mathematical formula}(D,E) and {a mathematical formula}(F,G) be such that {a mathematical formula}C(D − E)=C(F − G).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">We need to show {a mathematical formula} Σ ↓ (C(D − E))= Σ ↓ (C(F − G)).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">It follows from {a mathematical formula}C(D − E)=C(F − G), by Proposition 6, for all subsets {a mathematical formula}C ′ of {a mathematical formula}C, {a mathematical formula}(D,E) ∈ Cl(C ′ ) iff {a mathematical formula}(F,G) ∈ Cl(C ′ ).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Thus, by Proposition 3, {a mathematical formula}(D,E)=(F,G) and {a mathematical formula}C − (D,E)=C − (F,G).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Then, following (i), {a mathematical formula} Σ ↓ (C(D − E))= Σ ↓ (C(F − G)).2.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">{a mathematical formula} Σ ↓ (C(D − E)) ⊆ ⋃ (C(D − E)).Let {a mathematical formula}T2=(D,E) and {a mathematical formula}[T1,H] ∈ Σ ↓ (C(D − E)).</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Following (i), {a mathematical formula}[T1,H] ∈ C ∖ C − T2.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Thus, {a mathematical formula}[T1,H] ∈ C and {a mathematical formula}[T1,H] ∉ C − T2.</a>
