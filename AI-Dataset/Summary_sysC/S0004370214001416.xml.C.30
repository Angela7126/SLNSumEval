<a href="#0" id="0">Load displacement or swingIs the position of the load, at time t, expressed in coordinates {a mathematical formula} Η (t)=[ Φ (t) Θ (t)]T with the origin in the center of the mass of the joint quadrotor – load system (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Minimal residual oscillations trajectoryA trajectory of duration T is a minimal residual oscillations trajectory if for a given constant {a mathematical formula} Ε >0 there is a time {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ t1 ≤ T, such that for all {a mathematical formula}t ≥ t1, the load displacement is bounded by Ε , i.e.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula} ‖ Η (t) ‖ < Ε .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If MDP and V satisfy the conditions, the system is globally uniformly stable, i.e.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">a policy generated under these conditions will drive the quadrotor – load system from any initial state s to the goal state {a mathematical formula}sg=0.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We empirically show that the conditions are met.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We can also see that the swing is bounded throughout the trajectory, maintaining the displacement under {a mathematical formula}10 ∘ for the duration of the entire flight (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this part of the trajectory, the cubic trajectory shows a load swing of {a mathematical formula}5 – 12 ∘ , while the learned trajectory controls the swing to under {a mathematical formula}4 ∘ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Path-following with reduced load displacement evaluation compares the load displacement and path-following errors of Algorithm 1 with two other methods: a minimal residual oscillations method described in Section 3.2, and path-following with no load displacement reduction.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The path-following only method creates minimum time path-following trajectories, by choosing actions that transition the system as close as possible to the reference path in the direction of the goal state with no consideration to the load swing.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We use three reference trajectories: a straight line, a two-line segment, and a helix.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">8b quantifies the accumulated path-following error.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Path-following error for Algorithm 1 remains close to the path-following only trajectory.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For both trajectories, the accumulated path-following error is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than for the minimal residual oscillations method.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Examining the load displacement characteristics though power spectral analysis of the vector {a mathematical formula} Η =[ Φ Θ ]T time series, we notice that frequency profile of the trajectory generated with Algorithm 1 resembles closely that of the minimal residual oscillations trajectory (Fig.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">10 depicts the trajectory of the quadrotor and the load during the coffee delivery task for required maximal load displacements of {a mathematical formula}1 ∘ , {a mathematical formula}10 ∘ , and {a mathematical formula}25 ∘ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The accumulated squared error profiles differ based on the load displacement angle bound, with the {a mathematical formula}1 ∘ trajectory having accumulated error significantly smaller than other two trajectories.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The load's trajectories (Fig.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">12b) show higher uncertainty over the position of the load at any given time.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">However, the load displacement is bounded and stays within {a mathematical formula}10 ∘ .</a>
