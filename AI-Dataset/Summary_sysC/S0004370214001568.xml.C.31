<a href="#0" id="0">AI researchers soon recognized that to solve the “ kinds of problems now reserved for humans ” would require a substantive knowledge base and a host of ways to use it [16].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As engineers produced computers that could store vast quantities of data and process it quickly, the data-driven paradigm arose: what intelligence requires is enough facts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For some purposes, that approach is surprisingly successful (e.g., web search, self-driving cars).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The development of such a knowledge base has motivated massive AI efforts from CYC [22] to Watson [26], as well as recent funding initiatives.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Too often, however, statistical correlation fails to connect information in meaningful ways.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Artifacts like the Jeopardy-playing Watson remind us what remains beyond the reach of a program with a great deal of knowledge but not enough incisive procedures to apply it.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Productive dialogue requires not only a shared vocabulary but also a shared context in which to construct good answers.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A CI should elicit that context by asking questions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Many human endeavors have multiple goal criteria and require multiple decisions, each of which impacts several goals.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A CI that elicits its user's goals can ask how they should be prioritized, so that it can model both the user's knowledge and the user's expectations.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Our kitchen CI, for example, could ask whether the soup ingredients are to be purchased or limited to those on hand.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Some important questions address ambiguity or motivation.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">It is far easier to disambiguate with a question, such as “ Did you want me to prepare a soup or would you just like a recipe? ” Questions about the authority and significance of knowledge sources also help a CI filter information to reduce it to a manageable quantity: “ Do you prefer the approach of a particular chef? ” Questions can help a CI contend with misunderstandings and unanticipated occurrences.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Questions also relieve the CI of an obligation to understand perfectly.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">As envisioned here, a CI is not a general intelligence.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Each CI would target problem areas in which it could assist people, and provide representations and procedures to support particular human activities.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Many of the key issues for a CI, however, have already received preliminary research attention.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We take now as a running example, the sample dialogue with an appointment secretary in Fig.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">2.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Line 1 is an alert to the system by the human H; line 2 is a response from the collaborative intelligence CI.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Although it is unreasonable to expect a CI to detect the subtleties that dictate how people make decisions, a CI that detected inconsistencies in observed patterns could certainly ask questions to improve its performance.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">For example, as electronic calendars become the norm, it is increasingly likely that requests for “ personal ” and “ business ” meetings will be directed to the same CI.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">If a user meets someone to plan a project one day and meets the same person to play tennis the next, a CI that asks for clarification (e.g., “ isn't Saturday an unusual meeting time? ” ) has the opportunity to learn a new feature value and new associations for it.</a>
