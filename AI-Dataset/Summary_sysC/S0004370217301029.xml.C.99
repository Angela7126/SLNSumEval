<a href="#0" id="0">Note that the transition from {a mathematical formula}s1 to {a mathematical formula}s2 given a may not be instantaneous.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Specifically, during the transition from {a mathematical formula}s1 to {a mathematical formula}s2, intermediate states may be experienced.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The intermediate states may be the same as {a mathematical formula}s1 (i.e., during a's execution, the world state does not change from {a mathematical formula}s1) or they could be different from {a mathematical formula}s1 (i.e., during a's execution a new state is experienced).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We define the sequence of intermediate states as {a mathematical formula}Int(s1,a,s2,Co(s1,a)).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that the SAR task is remarkably different from the warehouse operation task in several aspects: (1) SAR task's termination time is usually unknown during task execution; (2) Unlike the fully stochastic process in which orders arrive at the warehouse system, the target objects in SAR are revealed by the robots themselves.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the warehouse operation task, using a subject group of Computer Science students, the results show that the 2-MYAO heuristic, deployed by the W-AID2 agent, significantly outperforms the 1-MYAO heuristic deployed by the W-AID1 agent, which in turn significantly enhanced human operator's performance compared to the baseline condition of no advising agent.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Using an additional group of students, this time we evaluate the 3-MYAO heuristic, deployed by the W-AID3 agent, which significantly outperforms the 2-MYAO heuristic deployed by the W-AID2 agent.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the SAR task, the results show that the 2-MYAO heuristic deployed by the S-AID significantly enhanced human operator's performance compared to the baseline condition of no advising agent.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For most tasks, including the warehouse operation and SAR tasks, the reward model has to be learned.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As there are presumably an infinite number of functional forms, we used the following basic procedure to select the functional form: each state feature was tested by itself and a single variable function was fitted to capture the observed influence of that feature on the task's reward.</a>
