<a href="#0" id="0">A vote Σ is a ranking in {a mathematical formula}L(A), and a profile {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ L(A)n is a collection of n rankings.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Suppose we are given a profile Π of n noisy rankings that are estimates of an underlying true ranking {a mathematical formula} Σ ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula} Σ ˆ =MiniMax(Bt( Π )).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula} Σ ˆ =argmin Σ ∈ Π d( Σ , Π ) be the ranking in Π which minimizes the distance from Π among all rankings in Π .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ be two rankings at distance {a mathematical formula}d ↓ (t).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ ∈ Bt( Π ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consider the profile Π consisting of {a mathematical formula}n/2 instances of Σ and {a mathematical formula}n/2 instances of {a mathematical formula} Σ rev.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, every extension of {a mathematical formula}PA has an average distance of {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ /2 ≤ t from Π .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The distance of this ranking from Ρ would be at least {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=13(mi2)= ⌊ 2t ⌋ , implying {a mathematical formula}k(Bt( Π )) ≥ ⌊ 2t ⌋ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Take rankings {a mathematical formula} Σ , Τ ∈ L(A).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Consider the profile Π consisting of {a mathematical formula}n/2 instances of Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ each.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Take a ranking {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ L(A).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Take a ranking {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ L(A).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Define rankings {a mathematical formula} Σ , Σ ′ ∈ L(A) as follows.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula} Let profile Π consist of {a mathematical formula}n/2 instances of Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ each.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Hence, every ranking {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ L(A) must mismatch with at least one of Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ in each of first {a mathematical formula}2 ⌊ 2t ⌋ positions.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Every ranking Ρ that achieves equality in Equation (8) is clearly in {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) because its average distance from the votes in Π is {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ /2 ≤ t.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Take a ranking {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ L(A).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Consider rankings Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Consider the profile Π consisting of {a mathematical formula}n/2 instances of Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ each.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Clearly, Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ have an average distance of {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ /2 ≤ t from rankings in Π .</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Take a ranking {a mathematical formula} Ρ ∈ L(A).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The alternative placed first in Ρ must be ranked at a position {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ or below in at least one of Σ and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ .</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Thus, there exists a ranking in {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) at distance at least {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ from Ρ , i.e., the minimax distance of {a mathematical formula}Bt( Π ) is at least {a mathematical formula} ⌊ 2t ⌋ , as desired.</a>
