<a href="#0" id="0">It is important to note that if ∇ is an ES basic fusion operator, restricted to the triple {a mathematical formula}W ⁎ , {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ , N, we can establish analogous results to those presented in Section 4 and Appendix A, adapting their statements to the case where a selected finite society N is chosen, the profiles are restricted N-profiles {a mathematical formula} Φ ⁎ over {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ , integrity constrains E, {a mathematical formula}E ′ are epistemic states in {a mathematical formula}E ⁎ and the interpretations w, {a mathematical formula}w ′ and {a mathematical formula}w ″ are elements in {a mathematical formula}W ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From this and the fact that {a mathematical formula}w>w ′ , it follows that {a mathematical formula}w ≻ Φ Π ≥ w ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, {a mathematical formula} Φ ↦ ⪰ Φ Π ≥ satisfies Property 3.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Similarly we obtain that Properties 4 and 4 ′ hold.In order to show that a quasilinearized projective operator satisfies (ESF-U), we will prove that {a mathematical formula} Φ ↦ ⪰ Π ≥ Φ satisfies property (u) given in Proposition 5.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, consider N in {a mathematical formula}F ⁎ (S), Φ an N-profile and {a mathematical formula} ⪰ ′ an epistemic state such that {a mathematical formula} ⪰ i= ⪰ ′ , for all i in N. Thus, {a mathematical formula} ⪰ lex( ⪰ dN, ≥ )= ⪰ lex( ⪰ ′ , ≥ ), showing that {a mathematical formula} ⪰ Φ Π ≥ = ⪰ ⪰ ′ Π ≥ .To see that (ESF-I) holds, it is enough to see that {a mathematical formula} Φ ↦ ⪰ Φ Π ≥ satisfies property (ind) given in Proposition 8.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, consider N in {a mathematical formula}F ⁎ (S), Φ and {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ a pair of N-profiles, and w, {a mathematical formula}w ′ two interpretations such that {a mathematical formula} ⪰ i ↾ {w,w ′ }= ⪰ i ↾ {w,w ′ } ′ , for all i in N. From the fact that {a mathematical formula} ⪰ dN ↾ {w,w ′ }= ⪰ dN ′ ↾ {w,w ′ }, we have {a mathematical formula} ⪰ lex( ⪰ dN, ≥ ) ↾ {w,w ′ }= ⪰ lex( ⪰ dN ′ , ≥ ) ↾ {w,w ′ }, that is, {a mathematical formula} ⪰ Φ Π ≥ ↾ {w,w ′ }= ⪰ Φ ′ Π ≥ ↾ {w,w ′ }.Now, since {a mathematical formula} ∇ Π ≥ satisfies unanimity and independence conditions, by Proposition 9 we have that (ESF-P) holds.In order to show that {a mathematical formula} ∇ Π ≥ satisfies (ESF-D), we will prove that its assignment satisfies Property (d) given in Proposition 10.</a>
