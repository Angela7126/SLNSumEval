<a href="#0" id="0">Two hidden assumptions are made in this case: the first is that the robots perform relatively smoothly, with the infrequent need for human intervention; the second is that the human operator is only required to perform a single task at any given moment.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Different techniques have been proposed to address this operator's challenge, for example in [32], where the authors investigate the manipulation of an object by a team of robots who follow a single human leader, thereby reducing the need for the human operator to interact directly with the robots.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S, time t and {a mathematical formula}k ≥ 1, we define the {a mathematical formula}Value function capturing the expected cumulative future reward by using k sequential pieces of advice, starting at state s at time t. That is, given that the task had terminated (i.e., {a mathematical formula}t ∉ T), no future reward is possible.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">There are two main possible answers to explain the observed high acceptance rate: 1) as our subject pool consisted of non-technically-oriented students, students heavily relied on the provided advice regardless of condition; 2) the newly sampled orders and malfunction series were more complex than the previously tested series, which could explain why human operators rely heavily on provided advice.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that the SAR task is remarkably different from the warehouse operation task in several aspects: (1) SAR task's termination time is usually unknown during task execution; (2) Unlike the fully stochastic process in which orders arrive at the warehouse system, the target objects in SAR are revealed by the robots themselves.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the warehouse operation task, using a subject group of Computer Science students, the results show that the 2-MYAO heuristic, deployed by the W-AID2 agent, significantly outperforms the 1-MYAO heuristic deployed by the W-AID1 agent, which in turn significantly enhanced human operator's performance compared to the baseline condition of no advising agent.</a>
