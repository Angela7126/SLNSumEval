<a href="#0" id="0">Similarly to a few other algorithms (e.g., GAC-allowed [6] and GAC-va [8]), STR3 provides an index for each constraint table, enabling a tuple sought with respect to a domain value to be found without visiting irrelevant tuples, thus reducing time complexity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">GAC algorithms normally follow the same pattern: a domain value is proved to be consistent by producing a valid tuple containing that value (in the case of positive table constraints) or by producing some evidence from auxiliary structures, e.g., a path in case of BDDs (Boolean Decision Diagrams), MDDs (Multi-valued Decision Diagrams), or tries [12], [21], [22].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">During search, STR3 (lines 10 – 33) is called for a constraint C every time a value a is removed from the domain of a variable X involved in C. Note that the instantiation of a variable X effectively invokes {a mathematical formula}STR3(C,X,a) for every value a that is present in the domain of X at the time of the assignment but which is not the value assigned to X.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The worst-case time complexity of STR3 along a single path of length m in the search tree is{a mathematical formula}O(rt+m)per constraint.STR3's operations can be seen from the point of view of the three main data structures: table, inv, and dep.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Because STR2 is sensitive to ordering, we can build a table constraint and a search path such that (1) each call to STR2 involves a domain reduction of exactly one value on every domain, so that the second improvement is useless, (2) each call to STR2 eliminates exactly one tuple, which is found at the end of the table.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As a result, the cost is {a mathematical formula}O( ∑ i=1mr(t − i)), which is {a mathematical formula}O(rtm) when {a mathematical formula}m ≪ t.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The use of an additional data structure containing pointers to elements of support lists is suggested so that these elements can also be accessed in {a mathematical formula}O(1) time — specifically, a two-dimensional array {a mathematical formula}ptr(C) of size {a mathematical formula}|rel(C)|×|scp(C)|.</a>
