<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, it is assumed that when engaging in a joint search all agents are a priori acquainted with the probability distribution functions and search costs of all agents, i.e., the only possible difference in the information available to the different agents throughout the joint search is their own findings and the findings of others.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The calculation of this latter value relies on the probability distribution function of the maximum value obtained along agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's search, denoted {a mathematical formula}fireturn(y).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to formulate {a mathematical formula}fireturn(y), we make use of the probability that the maximum value obtained along the search process of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai, when using the reservation value {a mathematical formula}ri, is less than x, denoted {a mathematical formula}Fireturn(x), calculated according to:{a mathematical formula} When {a mathematical formula}x<ri all n explored opportunities must result in a value below x.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The strategy of agent{a mathematical formula}Ai ∈ K ′ that maximizes the group's expected benefit, given the set of (not necessarily reservation-value based) strategies used by all other searching agents{a mathematical formula}K ′ /Ai, is to follow reservation value{a mathematical formula}ri, which satisfies:{a mathematical formula}where{a mathematical formula}f¯i(x)denotes the probability distribution function of the maximum value obtained by all agents except agent{a mathematical formula}Ai, throughout their search.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">(5) also has the intuitive interpretation as in the single agent's stand-alone search, in the form of indifference between the expected marginal utility from obtaining the value of the opportunity (represented by the right-hand term of the equation), this time, however, calculated for all group members (hence multiplied by k) and taking into consideration the findings of others.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Seemingly, one could expect the solution for the set of k equations of type (5) to result in a reservation value {a mathematical formula}ri= − ∞ for each agent that does not need to engage in search according to the optimal strategy, consequently eliminating the need to evaluate each subset separately.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We use {a mathematical formula}EBj(v) to denote the overall expected utility of the agents when j search periods remain, if the optimal fully cooperative search strategy is used, given that the best value obtained so far by any of the agents is v. The value of {a mathematical formula}EBj(v) can be calculated recursively, based on the overall expected utility of the subsequent search period:{a mathematical formula} where for the case where there is only one remaining search period:{a mathematical formula} The first element in (17) represents the sum of the search costs of the agents that engage in search during the coming search period.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's strategy can thus be represented as the mapping {a mathematical formula}S(v,j) → pij(v), where {a mathematical formula}pij(v) is the probability that {a mathematical formula}Ai will choose to explore an additional opportunity when the number of remaining allowed searches is j and the best value obtained so far by all agents is v. We use {a mathematical formula}EBij(v) to denote the expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai if it follows the optimal search strategy, given the strategies used by the other agents, with j search opportunities remaining, and the best value obtained through all the agents' searches so far is v.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">2 depicts the individual expected utility of the agents, in equilibrium, in a self-interested-agents setting, as a function of the number of agents k. The setting used for this example considers a search horizon of three search periods ({a mathematical formula}n=3) and the search cost is {a mathematical formula}c=0.1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Similar to the case of fully cooperative agents, here the increase in the number of remaining search periods results in a reduced individual search probability (which is equivalent to a decrease in the number of searching agents in the fully cooperative case).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The influence of the best value found thus far and the number of remaining opportunities over the expected utility, however, is strikingly opposite to the one that holds in the fully cooperative case; here an increase in these two parameters results in a decrease in the expected utility.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">When communication is continuous, the totally mixed equilibrium in this case results in an individual expected utility of 0.925.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If communication is prohibited throughout the process, the agents' individual expected utility, according to the totally mixed equilibrium, is 0.922.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In other words, the agents' expected utility increases by enabling communication between them throughout the search process.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Then we continue with an inductive proof, showing that if the reservation value calculated according to (5) is indeed the optimal strategy for any number of available opportunities {a mathematical formula}n ″ >n ′ then this reservation value should also be used when the number of available opportunities is {a mathematical formula}n ′ .In the absence of any other new information along the search process, agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's strategy is the mapping {a mathematical formula}S(x → ,n ′ ) → {terminate,resume}, where {a mathematical formula}x → is the set of values obtained so far and {a mathematical formula}n ′ is the number of potential remaining search periods.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Now consider the agent's decision regarding exploring one more opportunity, if the best value it obtained so far is x, the number of opportunities that can still be potentially explored is {a mathematical formula}n ′ , and the optimal strategy for {a mathematical formula}n ″ <n ′ is to use reservation value {a mathematical formula}ri according to (5).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">If {a mathematical formula}x>ri and the agent executes one additional search, then regardless of the value obtained next the agent will definitely terminate the search after the additional search (as it already has a value greater than {a mathematical formula}ri and according to the induction assumption the optimal strategy thereafter is the reservation value {a mathematical formula}ri).</a>
