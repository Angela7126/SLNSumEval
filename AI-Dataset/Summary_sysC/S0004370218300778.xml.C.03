<a href="#0" id="0">Credibility object – credibility baseLet {a mathematical formula}A be a set of agent identifiers and {a mathematical formula}P,Q,S ∈ A.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A credibility base is a finite set {a mathematical formula}C of credibility objects.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C2 from Example 2 where the following two credibility elements {a mathematical formula}A>C and {a mathematical formula}C>B are explicitly stored.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The first function returns all the credibility elements of a credibility base, i.e., {a mathematical formula}ce(C)={P>Q:[P>Q,S] ∈ C}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Considering the credibility base from Example 2, {a mathematical formula}ce(C2)={A>C,C>B,B>A,K>J} and {a mathematical formula}cl(C2)={A>C,C>B,B>A,A>B,C>A,B>C,K>J,A>A,B>B,C>C}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, the function {a mathematical formula}rel(C) returns the set of agent identifiers that are sources of credibility elements in {a mathematical formula}C, i.e., {a mathematical formula}rel(C)={S:[P>Q,S] ∈ C}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, in the following sections we will propose an argumentation formalism that given a credibility base it will find a non-contradictory subset of {a mathematical formula}cl(C) that has the information that is more reliable.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Each credibility element that can be inferred from a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C will have an argument associated that supports it, and such argument will contain the reliability information for that inference.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The set of all arguments that can be built from {a mathematical formula}C will be denoted as {a mathematical formula}ArgsC.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Observe that it is not possible to have arguments for a conclusion such as {a mathematical formula}A>A.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Note that even though an argument {a mathematical formula}X can have one or more credibility objects, each argument has only one conclusion.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">SubargumentLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base and {a mathematical formula}X,Z ∈ ArgsC, then {a mathematical formula}Z is a subargument of {a mathematical formula}X if and only if {a mathematical formula}Z ⊆ X.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Consider again the credibility base of our running example introduced in Example 2:{a mathematical formula} There are seven arguments that can be built from {a mathematical formula}C2.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Given an argument {a mathematical formula}X, the set {a mathematical formula}rel(X) contains all the agent identifiers which are sources of the credibility objects in {a mathematical formula}X, and hence {a mathematical formula}rel(X) represents the reliability of {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Nevertheless, in the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C2 there is more information that can be used.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">If {a mathematical formula}(Y,X) ∈ TAttsC then by Definition 5 there is a subargument {a mathematical formula}Z of {a mathematical formula}X such that {a mathematical formula}Y and {a mathematical formula}Z have contradictory conclusions.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Then, given that any argument is trivially a subargument of itself, by Definition 5 it holds that {a mathematical formula}(Z,Y) ∈ TAttsC.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Recall that given an argument {a mathematical formula}X the set {a mathematical formula}rel(X) represents the reliability of {a mathematical formula}X and contains all the agent identifiers that are sources of the credibility objects in {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Consider again the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C2 and Fig.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Consider the credibility base of our running example:{a mathematical formula} In Example 3, we have shown how from {a mathematical formula}C2 it is possible to build the arguments {a mathematical formula}A2,A3, and {a mathematical formula}A1, and Fig.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Therefore, by Definition 6 it holds that {a mathematical formula}(X, Β ) ∈ RAttsC.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Consider the credibility base{a mathematical formula} which is in fact {a mathematical formula}C2{a mathematical formula} ∪ {[J>H,Y]}.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Consider the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C5 from Example 5.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Consider the credibility base{a mathematical formula} that corresponds to {a mathematical formula}C5{a mathematical formula} ∪ {[Y>X,T]}.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">7 shows the arguments and attacks that can be built from {a mathematical formula}C8.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Consider for instance the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C7 from Example 7.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The associated AFRA {a mathematical formula}(ArgsC7,AttsC7) of that credibility base is depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Defeat in associated AFRALet {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC,AttsC 〉 be the associated AFRA of a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, {a mathematical formula} Α , Β ∈ AttsC and {a mathematical formula}X ∈ ArgsC ∪ AttsC:</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">In the associated AFRA {a mathematical formula}(ArgsC7,AttsC7) depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">{a mathematical formula} Α ∈ AttsC and Α defeats {a mathematical formula}Y.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Consider the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C7 and its associated AFRA as depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Consider the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C8 introduced in Example 8.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Extension of a credibility baseLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base and E a preferred extension of its associated AFRA {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC,AttsC 〉 .</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">We will say that E is an extension of a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C iff for any argument {a mathematical formula}X ∈ ArgsC if every subargument {a mathematical formula}Z ⊂ X is in E then {a mathematical formula}X is in E.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Justified credibilitiesLet {a mathematical formula}C be a credibility base and E an extension of {a mathematical formula}C, then the set of justified credibilities of E is {a mathematical formula}JE={A>B: 〈 X,A>B 〉 ∈ E}.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">For instance, the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C7 has only one extension that is the only preferred extension {a mathematical formula}EC7 of its associated AFRA {a mathematical formula} 〈 ArgsC7,AttsC7 〉 , which was shown in Example 12.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Note that in this case the credibility information in {a mathematical formula}C7 is enough for deciding in every conflictive situation.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Consider a credibility base {a mathematical formula}Cs={[O>P,X],[P>Q,Y],[Q>O,Z]}.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">By Definition 5, Definition 6, Definition 7 we have that {a mathematical formula} Α , Β ∈ RAttsC.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Then, by Definition 7 there are {a mathematical formula} Γ , Δ ∈ IAttsC such that Γ defeats Α and Δ defeats Β .</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Then, by Definition 8, it holds that {a mathematical formula} Ε , Ω ∈ E.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">If {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ JE, by Definition 14 it holds that there is an argument {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 in E, thus {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 in {a mathematical formula}ArgsC.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">By Definition 2 we have that {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ C and {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ cl(X).</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">Then {a mathematical formula}A>B ∈ cl(C).</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">Then by Definition 2, {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A>B 〉 ∈ ArgsC.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Therefore, by Definition 12 it holds that {a mathematical formula}E=ArgsC.</a>
