<a href="#0" id="0">In addition to temporal constraints, QSPs include state constraints that specify valid initial, operating, and goal regions for an activity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If an initial region is specified for an activity, then the trajectory must be within this initial region, in order for the activity to begin.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If an operating region is specified, then the trajectory must stay within this region for the duration of the activity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If a goal region is specified, then the trajectory must be within this region in order for the activity to end.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">4, the goal region constraint {a mathematical formula}CM ∈ r1 represents the requirement that the CM trajectory must be in region {a mathematical formula}r1 for the CM movement activity to finish successfully.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This states that the set of plant feasible trajectories includes ones that go from {a mathematical formula}Rinit to {a mathematical formula}Rgoal over the entire duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">More specifically, if a trajectory starting anywhere in the initial region, {a mathematical formula}Rinit, of the activity (see Definition 8) and ending somewhere in the goal region, {a mathematical formula}Rgoal, at any duration d such that {a mathematical formula}l ≤ d ≤ u, is Plant Feasible, then the activity is temporally feasible in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This implies that the actuation limits imposed by the plant, and the operating constraints of the activity allow for actuation commands that can be used to control the linearized subsystem to the goal region from the initial region, at any duration in the duration range.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Definition 17</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Temporally Controllable ActivityGiven an activity and associated plant, and given a Valid Control Policy, P, for the activity, the activity is Temporally Controllable by P in the duration range {a mathematical formula}[l,u] if the activity is Temporally Feasible in this range, and if all trajectories for the activity are consistent with (generated by) P. A trajectory is consistent with, or generated by P if for every state {a mathematical formula}x(k) in the trajectory, the subsequent state {a mathematical formula}x(k+1) results from applying P to {a mathematical formula}x(k).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Definition 19</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">QCPA Qualitative Control Plan (QCP) is a triple {a mathematical formula} 〈 E,Ac,Ct 〉 , where E is a set of events (Definition 7), {a mathematical formula}Ct is a set of temporal constraints on the events (Definition 10), and {a mathematical formula}Ac is a set of control activities (Definition 18).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Each event is either a start event or finish event of a control activity.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Definition 20</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Valid cross-section of a control activityA cross-section, {a mathematical formula}cd, of a control activity is valid iff{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Ai,Bi represent the discrete-time linearized dynamics of the linear subsystem {a mathematical formula}si, for the control activity, and where {a mathematical formula}u,xnew satisfy the actuation constraints {a mathematical formula}cc of {a mathematical formula}si (Definition 2), and also the QSP actuation and operation constraints {a mathematical formula}Rinput,Rop specified for the activity (Definition 8).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For the case of the last cross section before the goal, the new state requirement is {a mathematical formula}xnew ∈ Rgoal, where {a mathematical formula}Rgoal is the goal region specified for the activity in the QSP.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The executive's dispatcher component executes a QCP output by the plan compiler.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">To execute a QCP, the dispatcher must successfully execute each control activity.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The dispatcher accomplishes this by, in real time, monitoring plant state, and generating plant control inputs based on the appropriate QCP control policy for the current state and time.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This causes the state trajectory of the linearized sub-systems to reach activity goal regions at acceptable times.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">In this way, the dispatcher indirectly schedules start and finish events so that they are consistent with the temporal constraints of the QCP.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">This is a key difference between our dispatcher, and those of discrete activity execution systems [9], in which event times are set directly by the dispatcher.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We focus now on the currently executing activities.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The dispatcher sets the schedule for a currently executing activity by deciding a target completion time for it that is within the activity's execution window.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">However, unlike discrete activity systems, which can simply set the occurrence of events so that they coincide with target completion times, our dispatcher must generate control inputs that guide the hybrid plant to its goal state at the target completion time.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Thus, the activity completion event time cannot simply be set, but rather, occurs as a consequence of the control policy applied to the plant dynamics.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Definition 21</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Valid Control Policy for Target Completion TimeA Valid Control Policy that results in achievement of an activity's goal state at time {a mathematical formula}tf is denoted by {a mathematical formula}P(tf); it is a Valid Control Policy with respect to the target completion time {a mathematical formula}tf.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Definition 22</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Temporally Controllable Activity for Target Completion Time and Current StateAn activity is Temporally Controllable for Target Completion Time {a mathematical formula}tf from current state x if there exists a Valid Control Policy for Target Completion Time, {a mathematical formula}P(tf), that covers x.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">We call this a Valid Control Policy for Target Completion Time and State, and denote this by {a mathematical formula}P(tf,x).</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Theorem 3</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Dispatchable Executing QCPGiven a Plant Model (Definition 1), a QCP (Definition 19) that is dispatchable according toTheorem 1, and the current statex, suppose that each activity{a mathematical formula}aiin the set of currently executing activities is Temporally Controllable in the duration range{a mathematical formula}[li,ui]for the current state according toLemma 5.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Let N be the Simple Temporal Network formed by combining the temporal constraints of the QCP before execution, with the duration range temporal constraints{a mathematical formula}[li,ui]for the currently executing activities.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">If N is dispatchable[9], then a trajectory and schedule exist that satisfy successful execution of the QCP.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Conversely, if N is not dispatchable, then no schedule exists for successful execution.</a>
