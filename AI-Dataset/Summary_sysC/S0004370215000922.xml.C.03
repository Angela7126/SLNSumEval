<a href="#1" id="1">An innocuous probabilistic conditional of Γ is a probabilistic conditional {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Γ such that, for every dominant consolidation {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ of Γ , {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Γ ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that all abrupt consolidations {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ of Γ are consistent with Α .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Now suppose there is a maximal abrupt consolidation {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ such that {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ Γ ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Γ , there is a {a mathematical formula} Β ∈ Ψ such that {a mathematical formula} Α ⊊ Β .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Any consolidation Ψ of {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ must also be formed by atoms in {a mathematical formula}X Γ ′ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If Δ is a consolidation of Γ , there is a consolidation Ψ of {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ such that {a mathematical formula} Δ = Ψ ∪ { Β }, for some Β such that {a mathematical formula} Α ⊆ Β .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ is an abrupt consolidation of Γ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">( ← ) Consider a minimal inconsistent set {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ that is a widening of Γ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Furthermore any {a mathematical formula} Ψ i ⊊ Γ ′ is consistent, for {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ is a minimal inconsistent set.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ is a minimal inconsistent set.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Suppose there is an inescapable conflict {a mathematical formula} Δ ⊆ Γ such that {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Δ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let {a mathematical formula} Ψ ′ be a consolidation of Ψ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Consequently, {a mathematical formula} Ψ ′ ∪ { Α } is a consolidation of Δ for any consolidation {a mathematical formula} Ψ ′ of Ψ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">( ← ) Suppose there is no inescapable conflict Δ in Γ such that {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Δ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Consider the base {a mathematical formula} Ψ = Γ ∖ { Α }.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As all inescapable conflicts of Γ are in Ψ , by Corollary 4.14, {a mathematical formula} Ψ ′ ∪ { Α } is consistent.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Hence, Α is consistent with any consolidation {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ = Ψ ′ ∪ { Β } and Α is innocuous by Lemma 4.5.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Consider the base {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ = Ψ ′ ∖ { Β }, such that {a mathematical formula} Α ⊆ Β .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">As {a mathematical formula} Α =( Φ | Ψ )[q_,q¯] is innocuous, Α is consistent with {a mathematical formula} Γ ′ and {a mathematical formula} Ψ ′ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Hence, {a mathematical formula} Ψ ′ ∪ { Α }= Λ Γ (r ′ ) is a consolidation of Γ .</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Let {a mathematical formula} Ψ = Γ ∪ { Α } be a knowledge base.</a>
