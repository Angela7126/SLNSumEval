<a href="#1" id="1">MM never expands a node whose f-value exceeds {a mathematical formula}C ⁎ .</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">Uni-BS only expands nodes that are near to or far from {a mathematical formula}start.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, Uni-BS will usually not expand all nodes that are exactly distance {a mathematical formula}C ⁎ from {a mathematical formula}start.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, MMe will have no advantage over MM for such nodes since for both systems these nodes have a priority smaller than {a mathematical formula}C ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The second heuristic is {a mathematical formula}h888.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By Lemma 14, MMe's forward search never expands a node when {a mathematical formula}C>C ⁎ , so if n was expanded in the forward search {a mathematical formula}prF(n) ≤ C ⁎ .</a>
