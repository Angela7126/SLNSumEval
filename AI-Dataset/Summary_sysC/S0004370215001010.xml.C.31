<a href="#0" id="0">Both contributions together result in relational linear programming, best summarized as{a mathematical formula} The user describes a relational problem in a high-level, relational LP modeling language and — given a logical knowledge base (LogKB) encoding some individuals or rather data — the system automatically compiles a symmetry-reduced LP that in turn can be solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Before starting to develop lifted linear programming, let us illustrate fractional automorphisms and partition matrices.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Reconsider the equitable partition {a mathematical formula}P0={{1,2},{3};{1}{2,3}{4}} of the LP {a mathematical formula}L0 in our running example.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The fractional automorphism of {a mathematical formula}L0 induced by (3) is{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} Moreover, Proposition 4 holds since{a mathematical formula} It is easily verified that {a mathematical formula}cTXP=cT and {a mathematical formula}XQb=b hold as well.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As an alternative, since index sets and data tables are closely related to the attributes and relations of relational database systems, there have also been proposals for “ feeding ” a linear program directly from relational database systems [64], [65], [66] as well as AMPL's interface with relational databases to define sets and parameters.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, this takes the “ logic ” out of the LP modeling language.</a>
