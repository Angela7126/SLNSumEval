<a href="#1" id="1">Given a POMDP G with a reachability objective {a mathematical formula}Reach(T), a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ Σ is almost-sure winning iff {a mathematical formula}P Λ 0 Σ (Reach(T))=1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We will denote by {a mathematical formula}AlmostG(T) the set of almost-sure winning strategies in POMDP G for the objective {a mathematical formula}Reach(T).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a set U such that all states in U have the same observation, a strategy is almost-sure winning from U, if given the uniform probability distribution {a mathematical formula} Λ U over U we have {a mathematical formula}P Λ U Σ (Reach(T))=1; i.e., the strategy ensures almost-sure winning if the starting belief support is U.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">2 with three states: the initial state {a mathematical formula}s0, and two absorbing states (the target state T, and the losing state B).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We present a double-exponential lower bound on {a mathematical formula}optAsCost with respect to the number of states of the POMDP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We define a family of POMDPs {a mathematical formula}F(n), for every n, with a single target state, such that there exists an almost-sure winning strategy, and for every almost-sure winning strategy the expected number of steps to reach the target state is double-exponential in the number of states of the POMDP.</a>
