<a href="#0" id="0">After analyzing both algorithms, we have observed that the underlying idea comes from the following observation: a MaxSAT formula {a mathematical formula} Φ n with n soft clauses and {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ n) ≥ e, {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ e ≤ n is MaxSAT reducible (Definition 5) to a formula {a mathematical formula} Φ n ′ + 〈 □ ,e 〉 with {a mathematical formula}n − e soft clauses and e empty clauses:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Where {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ n ′ )=cost( Φ n) − cost( 〈 □ ,e 〉 ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, if we could identify a {a mathematical formula} Φ n whose optimal cost is greater than 1, we could directly write the {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ n)-Cardinality constraint and skip all the intermediate iterations performed by Eva and OLL.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a curiosity, we have observed that the transformation made to {a mathematical formula} Φ b using the MaxSAT resolution rule and the introduction of auxiliary variables corresponds indeed to the regular encoding of 1-Cardinality constraint in [44], as we can see in Example 2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Another interesting observation comes from the fact that the regular encoding of a 1-Cardinality constraint is equivalent to the Sequential counter encoding [48] for k-Cardinality constraints when {a mathematical formula}k=1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The soft clause {a mathematical formula} 〈 o ‾ 21,1 〉 and corresponding Cardinality constraint are highlighted, meaning they are not needed to check if {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ 1)=0 in the next iteration (({a mathematical formula}o ‾ 21) is satisfied for all assignments to {a mathematical formula}bi variables that satisfy ({a mathematical formula}o ‾ 11)).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The big boxes represent the Cardinality constraints (see Section 5):{a mathematical formula}In the second iteration, the three algorithms retrieve an unsatisfiable core from {a mathematical formula} Φ 1 and proceed to generate {a mathematical formula} Φ 2.</a>
