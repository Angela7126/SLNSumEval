<a href="#0" id="0">Although several hybrid methods exist that search for a small subset of the training set, and simultaneously achieve the elimination of noisy and superfluous cases, competence enhancement and competence preservation methods can be combined to achieve the same objectives as hybrid methods [6].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since this research focuses on case-based techniques in dynamic environments where concept drift may occur, we will give a more detailed review of CBM methods in Section 2; 2) instance weighting, where each instance is assigned a weight to represent the decreasing relevance of existing training examples.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This phenomenon poses additional challenges for existing case-base editing methods that implicitly assume that existing cases are drawn from a fixed yet unknown distribution, i.e., stationary assumption [22].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We argue that this is too aggressive and is inappropriate, particularly in the concept drift environment, for the following reasons: First, it will destroy the original case distribution, thus affecting the result of any change detection method which directly compares the case distribution.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When concept drift is detected, it also identifies the competence area where the distribution changes most significantly; 2) Noise-Enhanced Fast Context Switch (NEFCS), which enhances the system's learning capacity under concept drift; 3) Stepwise Redundancy Removal (SRR) method which controls the size of the case-base to tackle the performance issue.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Although any change detection technique can be adopted to accomplish this task, we choose the competence-based drift detection method [28], which uses the competence model as a space partition technique and compares the empirical distribution of two case windows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The main reason for adopting the competence-based change detection method is that it cannot only warn of possible concept drift but it can also highlight a small region of the problem space in terms of case-base competence, called the identified competence area (Definition 8), which is most likely to be affected by concept drift.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">When working with other change detection methods which have no capacity to locate concept drifts, all new cases will be exempt from removal, which is also the case when {a mathematical formula}p=0 in Definition 8.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">There are three reasons for us to use a different way of constructing the competence model for change detection purposes: 1) While performing change detection, the competence model should reflect the current competence contribution of each case.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">While performing case-base editing, the competence model should reflect the maximum contribution of each case, since cases may be removed at any time.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Table 2 shows a summary of the test data across each month for both datasets.Similar to Spam Filtering – static, each email {a mathematical formula}ei is represented by a vector of features {a mathematical formula}ei= 〈 x1,x2, ⋯ ,xn 〉 , where each feature is binary, and we use the same similarity as described in Experiment 1.Since error rate is not a good metric for skewed datasets, the most common effectiveness metrics [66] for spam filtering are used to evaluate effectiveness, where Legitimate Recall (LR) is defined as {a mathematical formula}LR=TNTN+FP=TNN, and Legitimate Precision (LP) is defined as {a mathematical formula}LP=TNTN+FN, where FP means legitimate emails that are incorrectly classified as spam, and FN means spam emails that are incorrectly classified as legitimate.In this experiment, we again compare our algorithm with two closely related concept handling methods, IB3 [50] and PECS [53], as well as other well-known competence enhancement methods designed for static tasks, ENN [33] and BBNR [5], and the Full Base which performs no noise removal at all.</a>
