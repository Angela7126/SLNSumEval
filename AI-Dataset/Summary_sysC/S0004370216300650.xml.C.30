<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}Dx ′ ,Dy ‾ ′ denote the domains of {a mathematical formula}x,y → right before the propagation of {a mathematical formula}c1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Also, let {a mathematical formula} ⊢ cp denote the provability relation by constraint propagation, i.e., {a mathematical formula} Φ ⊢ cp Ψ denotes that starting with a set of constraints and domains Φ , the set of literals Ψ is derivable through constraint propagation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let S be some set of values.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then it is not hard to see that the following is a contradiction for any constraint {a mathematical formula}c(x,y → ):{a mathematical formula} or, equivalently, that the following implication is valid:{a mathematical formula} Let {a mathematical formula}X denote the set of values of x which have no support in {a mathematical formula}Dy ‾ ′ :{a mathematical formula} Instantiating (15) with {a mathematical formula}c1 ∧ 2 for c and with {a mathematical formula}X for S yields the inference rule that we call Combine:{a mathematical formula}</a>
