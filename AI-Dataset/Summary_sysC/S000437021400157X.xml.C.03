<a href="#0" id="0">This paper presents an approach to creating a semantic map of an indoor environment incrementally and in closed loop, based on a series of 3D point clouds captured by a mobile robot using an RGB-D camera.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Based on a semantic model about furniture objects (represented in an OWL-DL ontology with rules attached), we generate hypotheses for locations and 6DoF poses of object instances and verify them by matching a geometric model of the object (given as a CAD model) into the point cloud.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Also, it has advantages for the map building process itself: If the class and location of objects in the map are known, object models could be used to hypothesize missing sensor data, or loop-closing in mapping can be based on semantic as well as geometric information.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">Additionally, we include new comprehensive results about what effect the degree of similarity between CAD model and actual object has on the quality of the final pose estimation, and we apply the method to a full scene point cloud using a 6D SLAM algorithm.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">CAD models have been used for object recognition before.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">[26] use CAD models to create synthetic point clouds of several types of furniture and extract geometric features which are used to build a vocabulary of objects via machine learning techniques.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">An impressive recent approach to the problem of 3D object mapping is the SLAM++ system by Salas-Moreno et al.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However their work focuses on streams of registered point clouds and thus the available data is usually much more complete than from a single frame.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Using the information contained in CAD models for object recognition has several advantages.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Since ICP needs two point clouds as input, we create a surface sampling of the CAD model to fulfill the algorithm's requirements.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To investigate how robust our ICP matching step is with respect to such differences between CAD model and actual object, we conducted an experiment where we matched several CAD models of chairs against recorded point data of a chair.</a>
