<a href="#0" id="0">Note that the subtraction of 1 in the definition of {a mathematical formula}Imc is to ensure that a consistent knowledge base has inconsistency value 0 (a consistent knowledge base has one maximal consistent subset, itself, and no self-contradictory formulas).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If the knowledge base is inconsistent, then the probability mass must be distributed (recall that an inconsistent set of formulas cannot be satisfied by a single interpretation Ω ; thus the probability {a mathematical formula}P( Ω ) can only be associated with a subset of this set).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In its simplest implementation, the inconsistency measure {a mathematical formula}IMI is defined to be exactly the number of the minimal inconsistent subsets of a knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Accordingly, in order to determine the number {a mathematical formula}Cf(IMI,n) it is necessary to investigate how many different minimal inconsistent subsets a knowledge base with n formulas may possess.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">More precisely, for any knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K, formulas Φ , {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ with {a mathematical formula} Φ ≡ Φ ′ we have {a mathematical formula}I Η (K ∪ { Φ })=I Η (K ∪ { Φ ′ }) as {a mathematical formula}P( Φ )=P( Φ ′ ) for every probability function.</a>
