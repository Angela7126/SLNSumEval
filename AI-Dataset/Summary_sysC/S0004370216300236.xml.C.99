<a href="#0" id="0">In this case, {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ corresponds to the type spaces used in Bayesian games and ϒ corresponds to the “ basic probability distribution ” [56].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">(However, note that in contrast to Bayesian games, we assume no knowledge of {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ and ϒ .)</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We provide theoretical conditions under which these formulations produce correct beliefs, and we provide examples to show when they may fail to do so.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our definition of correctness is with respect to the type distribution ϒ : beliefs are said to be correct if they assign the same probabilities to true types as ϒ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This requires that the beliefs can point to the types in the support of the type distribution.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, the results in this section pertain to a situation in which the user knows that the true type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ must be a subset of the hypothesised type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Theorem 2 explains why the sum posterior converges to the correct type distribution in Example 2.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since the types {a mathematical formula} Θ A and {a mathematical formula} Θ B always choose different actions and are completely deterministic (i.e.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">the average overlap and stochasticity are always zero), the sum posterior is guaranteed to converge to the type distribution.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">On the other hand, in Example 3 the types {a mathematical formula} Θ A and {a mathematical formula} Θ AB produce an overlap whenever action A is chosen, and {a mathematical formula} Θ AB is completely random.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Therefore, the average overlap and stochasticity are always positive, and an incorrect type distribution was learned.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}H ˆ in (3)/(4)) and, therefore, constitute redundancy in both time and space.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Thus, we believe it is advisable to use type spaces which have low average overlap.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As noted earlier, an implicit assumption in (1) is that the type distribution ϒ can be represented as a product of n independent factors (one for each player), such that {a mathematical formula} ϒ ( Θ )= ∏ j ϒ j( Θ j).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, since the sum posterior is in the form of (1), it is in fact only guaranteed to learn independent type distributions.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Given a SBG Γ , we define the ideal process, X, as the process induced by Γ in which player i is controlled by HBA and in which HBA always knows the current and all future types of all players.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Then, given a posterior formulation Pr and hypothesised type spaces {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ for all {a mathematical formula}j ≠ i, we define the user process, Y, as the process induced by Γ in which player i is controlled by HBA (same as in X) and in which HBA uses Pr and {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ in the usual way.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Thus, the only difference between X and Y is that X can always predict the player types whereas Y approximates this knowledge through Pr and {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In order to interpret PCTL expressions over X and Y, we make the following modifications without loss of generality: Firstly, any terminal state {a mathematical formula}s¯ ∈ S¯ is an absorbing state, meaning that if a process is in {a mathematical formula}s¯, then the next state will be {a mathematical formula}s¯ with probability 1 and all players receive a zero payoff.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In this regard, we note that any combination of beliefs Pr and types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ can be described as a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j ⁎ of the form{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This combination is equivalent to sampling a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j ⁎ using probabilities {a mathematical formula}Pr( Θ j ⁎ |Ht), and then using {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ to choose actions {a mathematical formula}aj ∈ Aj via {a mathematical formula} Π j(Ht,aj, Θ j ⁎ )[68].</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Analogously, we may combine the true types {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ⊂ Θ j of player j, using the type distribution ϒ , into a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j+ such that{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Therefore, to simplify the notation in this section, we will generally assume a single hypothesised type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j and a single true type {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ∈ Θ j.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Note that this means that our method can be applied to the combination of beliefs and hypothesised types, as well as to individual types in {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Furthermore, we will write {a mathematical formula} Π j(Ht, Θ j) to denote the probability distribution over actions {a mathematical formula}Aj (rather than probabilities of individual actions).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">To see this, first recall that the standard central limit theorem requires the random variables {a mathematical formula}T Τ to be independent and identically distributed.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">In our case, {a mathematical formula}T Τ are independent in that the random outcome of {a mathematical formula}T Τ has no effect on the outcome of {a mathematical formula}T Τ ′ .</a>
