<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:7} A similar notion is the superadditive cover discussed in [21], which is the superadditive game defined by the payoff function {a mathematical formula}v ˆ such that, for each coalition {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ N, {a mathematical formula}v ˆ (C) is the maximum social welfare that can be attained over all the possible coalition structures built by agents in C. Interestingly, it is known that the superadditive cover can be used to characterize core-related solution concepts when coalition structures are allowed [21], but this is not useful to derive tight bounds in our complexity analysis, since building the superadditive cover requires to compute the social welfare over exponentially many coalitions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since checking the non-emptiness of the core (when all coalitions are feasible ones) is in {a mathematical formula}co-NP[44], the proof basically reduces to show that the value {a mathematical formula}SWopt( Γ ), whose knowledge is required to define the payoff associated with the grand-coalition in {a mathematical formula} Γ ˜ Δ , can be computed in polynomial time by exploiting an NP oracle.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, the proof of the membership of CS-Core-Membership in {a mathematical formula}co-NP over the class {a mathematical formula}CK(R) (and, hence, over {a mathematical formula}CKsa(R)) is a simple adaptation of the result derived in the setting where all coalitions are allowed to form [9] — see the proof of Theorem 4.1.Then, consider the remaining results to be shown on the class {a mathematical formula}CKsa(R).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, {a mathematical formula}|F(G)| ≤ (|N|2)+(|N|1) holds and, consequently, CS-Core-Membership is feasible in polynomial time.Concerning the computation problem CS-Core-Find, observe that, whenever an optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ CS-opt( Γ ) is given, then {a mathematical formula}CS-core( Γ ) is completely determined by a system of linear inequalities, because of Fact 3.5.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, we need just to show that (i) and (ii) can be checked in polynomial time over lines.Indeed, by Claim 6.2, the optimal social welfare can be computed in polynomial time, in fact, together with a feasible coalition structure {a mathematical formula} Π ∈ CS-opt( Γ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Assume that{a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ is a coalition structure in{a mathematical formula}CS-opt( Γ |i).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, there is a coalition structure Π over G such that{a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ = Π |i.</a>
