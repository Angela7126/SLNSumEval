<a href="#0" id="0">Opponent Model: this module constructs a model of the preference profile of the opponent through a learning technique.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Strictly speaking, the model must either use an unsupervised learning technique or somehow pre-estimate the utility values of the received bids from the opponent and use the estimated values as the output label for the training examples.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The negotiation issue weight values are simply calculated according to their rankings among all negotiation issue weights (e.g., as in the model proposed by Hinkriks and Tykhonov [12]).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Here, the evaluation of a negotiation issue value for the opponent is given by 1 minus the evaluation of that negotiation issue value for the agent (e.g., the models proposed by Jazayeriy et al.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The utility values of the offers received from the opponent are known for the agent (e.g., the models proposed by Hinkriks and Tykhonov [12] and Williams et al.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In fact, the models in this category try to estimate the utility function of the opponent and then use this function to calculate the utility of a given bid in the opponent's utility space.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These models consider the hypothesis space as the preference order of the negotiation issues as well as evaluation values of each negotiation issue.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Model with a slight difference: the unchanged issue values are determined by comparing the values of the last and first bids received from the opponent [40].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our model is the first proposed model in the fourth category that uses perceptron units as the underlying mathematical basis for opponent modeling.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The algorithm of the perceptron-based opponent model is proposed in Section 4.2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The second function receives an offer vector {a mathematical formula} Ω → which specifies the issue values for all the negotiation issues of a new offer recently received from the opponent.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">More importantly, in such models the number of bids that the agents exchange before reaching deadline is limited [2], and this is another important challenge that an opponent model should overcome.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">for automated bilateral multi issue negotiations [38] is also applied here to evaluate the accuracy of this proposed POPPONENT model versus the state of the art opponent models.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Each one of these 20 {a mathematical formula}(=8+5+1+1+5)opponent models is equipped with a bidding strategy to compete with an opponent agent.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, to be able to compare the different opponent models, all the models being trained under the same circumstances should be confirmed to allow the non-adaptive opponents to be applied for training this proposed opponent model as well as the other models.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This proposed opponent model is trained to perform against all deterministic opponent agents in 45 aforementioned scenarios, a total of 495 {a mathematical formula}(=11×45) negotiation sessions.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In other words, a total number of 82810 {a mathematical formula}(=11830×7) sessions are executed in the second experiment to evaluate this newly proposed model together with the state of the art opponent models in a fair realistic competition.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In the setting adopted in Experiment I (Section 5.1.1), the accuracy of this proposed model is evaluated together with other opponent models through a Pearson Correlation between the estimated and real bid utilities [38]:{a mathematical formula} where, {a mathematical formula}uOP is the real utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ is the estimated utility space or preference profile of the opponent, {a mathematical formula}uOP( Ω → ) is the real utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space, and {a mathematical formula}uOP ′ ( Ω → ) is the estimated utility of the negotiation outcome {a mathematical formula} Ω → in the opponent's utility space.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In Experiment II (Section 5.1.2), the performance of this proposed model is evaluated by measuring the real performance of agents applying opponent models in real world experimental negotiation scenarios.</a>
