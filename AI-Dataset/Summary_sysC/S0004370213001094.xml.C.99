<a href="#0" id="0">The set {a mathematical formula}ground ⁎ ( Π ) is obtained from {a mathematical formula}ground( Π ) by replacing a constraint atom a by ⊤ or ⊥ if a is true or false respectively.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A ground constraint atom evaluates to true or false under a standard interpretations of its symbols.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, a constraint atom {a mathematical formula}1=1 evaluates to true, whereas a constraint atom {a mathematical formula}1 ≠ 1 evaluates to false.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}ground ⁎ ( Π ) is a nested program.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For instance, let {a mathematical formula}ground( Π ) consist of two rules{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} then {a mathematical formula}ground ⁎ ( Π ) is{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If we define the semantics of an AC program as the semantics of a corresponding nested program {a mathematical formula}ground ⁎ ( Π ) then mixed atoms will never be part of answer sets (indeed, mixed atoms never occur in the heads of the rules).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We now show that {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}ac( Π ).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By the definition, {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}ac( Π ) if {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of{a mathematical formula} By Proposition 11, {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of (15) iff X is an answer set of{a mathematical formula} The transformation described in Observation 1 applied to (16) will result in {a mathematical formula} Π A.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We are given that X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π A.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Consequently, it is an answer set of (16).Right-to-left: Let M be a functional set of ground atoms of Σ and X be a set of ground atoms such that {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of {a mathematical formula}ac( Π ).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula}V[ Π ] denote the set of all clingcon variables occurring in Π .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">From the fact that M is a functional set it follows that for every variable {a mathematical formula}p(r → ) ∈ V[ Π ] there is an atom of the form {a mathematical formula}p(r → ,c) in M. We can construct an assignment A for {a mathematical formula}V[ Π ] as follows: for every variable {a mathematical formula}p(r → ) ∈ V[ Π ], {a mathematical formula}A(p(r → ))=c where {a mathematical formula}p(r → ,c) ∈ M.By the definition of an answer set for an AC program, {a mathematical formula}X ∪ M is an answer set of (15).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Furthermore, by Proposition 11, X is an answer set of (16).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">From {a mathematical formula} Π A construction and it follows that the transformation described in Observation 1 applied to (16) will result in {a mathematical formula} Π A.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We are given that X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π A.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Consequently, X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π A and therefore a constraint answer set of Π .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">It is easy to see that set {a mathematical formula}(QD,C+) Ξ ∪ (QD,C − ) Ξ is a splitting set of {a mathematical formula} Π Ξ .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The bottom part of {a mathematical formula} Π Ξ (relevant to this splitting set) consists of choice rules for each atom occurring in {a mathematical formula}(QD,C) Ξ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">It follows that {a mathematical formula}(QD,C+) Ξ is an answer set of the bottom.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Let U denote {a mathematical formula}(QD,C+) Ξ ∪ (QD,C − ) Ξ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Note that {a mathematical formula}eU( Π Ξ ∖ bU( Π Ξ ),(QD,C+) Ξ ) coincides with {a mathematical formula} Π (Q) ′ .Left-to-right: Let X be an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π (Q).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">By the Theorem on Constraints [24] it follows that X is also an answer set of the program {a mathematical formula} Π (Q) ′ .</a>
