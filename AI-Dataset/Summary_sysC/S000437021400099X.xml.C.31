<a href="#0" id="0">The above-mentioned results show that the (unary) unbiased black-box model for several classic test problems gives complexity estimates much closer to the performance of commonly used randomized search heuristics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show that this observation does not extend in general to difficult combinatorial optimization problems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We demonstrate an {a mathematical formula}NP-hard subclass of the classic combinatorial optimization problem Partition which has a small polynomial unbiased black-box complexity, even if the arity of the variation operators is restricted to one.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">More precisely, we consider the subclass {a mathematical formula}Partition ≠ of all Partition instances with pairwise different weights.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For two natural formulations of this problem (one using a signed and one using an unsigned objective function, see Sections 3.1 and 3.2) we prove that there exists a unary unbiased black-box algorithm that solves any of such instances using only {a mathematical formula}O(nlog ⁡ n) function evaluations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">k-ary unbiased black-box algorithms can now be described via the scheme of Algorithm 2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The k-ary unbiased black-box complexity of some class of functions {a mathematical formula}F is the complexity of {a mathematical formula}F with respect to all k-ary unbiased black-box algorithms.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">There is no one best way of how to consider {a mathematical formula}Partition ≠ as an optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For two different models of {a mathematical formula}Partition ≠ , different with respect to the objective function, we show (Theorem 4, Theorem 6) that the unary unbiased black-box complexity is {a mathematical formula}O(nlog ⁡ n).</a>
