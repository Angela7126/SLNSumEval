<a href="#0" id="0">Following our running example we can define the abstract decision framework {a mathematical formula} 〈 Xr,Cr,>Cr,Kr, Γ r 〉 , with the set of alternatives {a mathematical formula}Xr={box1,box2,box3}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The epistemic component {a mathematical formula}Kr (explained in detail below) will contain evidence obtained from the domain (e.g., {a mathematical formula}smaller(box1,box3), {a mathematical formula}smaller(box2,box3)) and arguments for and against considering one box better than another one.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These arguments will be considered by the dynamic argumentation framework to obtain the agent's conclusions (e.g., {a mathematical formula}better(box1,box3)).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This epistemic component provides a knowledge representation tool that allows for the representation of preferences and conflicts among the agent's available alternatives.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula} Σ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Σ 2 be two argumental structures in W, then{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}dlits( Σ ) ⊆ C is the set of distinguished literals that are contained in arguments of an argumental structure Σ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have shown in Example 5 that given a working set of arguments {a mathematical formula}Wr, the available evidence {a mathematical formula}Er will determine a set {a mathematical formula}Activer ⊆ Wr with the current set of active arguments.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, the conflict relation {a mathematical formula} ⋈ r and the preference function {a mathematical formula}prefr are used for determining the set {a mathematical formula}Warrantedr ⊆ Activer of the current warranted arguments.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We will introduce next the decision component of our framework; this component will use the justified conclusions supported by arguments in {a mathematical formula}Warrantedr to determine which alternatives will be selected.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We will formalize now the decision component Γ of our proposed abstract decision framework {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,C,>C,K, Γ 〉 L, and we will propose an algorithm for computing the selecting alternatives.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As we have mentioned, the decision component is a set of decision rules that will effectively implement the agent's decision making policy.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Decision rules [27], that will be used to decide among alternatives from a choice experiment {a mathematical formula}B ⊆ X, are formalized in following definition.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Then, to determine which alternatives will be selected from a choice experiment B it is necessary to consider all the decision rules from Γ that are applicable with respect to the justified conclusions that can be inferred from the active arguments of {a mathematical formula}K. The set of acceptable alternatives can be defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Definition 9</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Set of acceptable alternativesLet {a mathematical formula}B ⊆ X be a set of alternatives posed to the agent and {a mathematical formula} 〈 X,C,>C,K, Γ 〉 be the agent's decision framework.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Then, the set of acceptable alternatives {a mathematical formula} Ω B of the agent will be defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Note that this algorithm implements a choice rule as introduced in Section 2.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">That is because the algorithm assigns to each set of alternatives {a mathematical formula}B ∈ B a non-empty set that represents the alternatives that the decision maker might choose when presented with the alternatives in B.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Definition 13</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Given a set {a mathematical formula}Args of arguments, an argumental structure for a claim Α from {a mathematical formula}Args is a tree of arguments Σ verifying:</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The set of arguments belonging to Σ is denoted as {a mathematical formula}args( Σ ).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Definition 16</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">A dynamic argumentation framework (DAF) is a four tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 E,W, ⋈ ,pref 〉 , composed by a set E of evidence, a working set W of arguments, a conflict relation {a mathematical formula} ⋈ ⊆ W×W, and a preference function {a mathematical formula}pref defined over {a mathematical formula}str(W, ⋈ ).</a>
