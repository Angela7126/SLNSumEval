<a href="#0" id="0">In other words, under the stable semantics particular outcomes (in the example the set {a mathematical formula}S of extensions) can only be achieved via afs containing at least one rejected argument.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, the stable semantics makes proper use of rejected arguments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As we will see, all semantics under consideration (except naive semantics) show a similar behavior.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It can be seen that stable semantics yields two extensions {a mathematical formula}{a,d} and {a mathematical formula}{b,c} for {a mathematical formula}F2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since c and d do not occur together in an extension there is an implicit conflict and thus {a mathematical formula}F2 is not analytic (for stable semantics).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, the naive extensions of {a mathematical formula}F2 are given by {a mathematical formula}{a,d}, {a mathematical formula}{b,c}, {a mathematical formula}{c,d}.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus c and d are not in an implicit conflict here, and the af is easily seen to be analytic for naive semantics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Indeed, by definition of naive semantics, two arguments occur together in a naive extension if and only if there is no attack between them and they are not self-attacking.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus not every af is analytic for naive semantics, but it is quite easy to see that every af can be turned into an equivalent analytic one over the same arguments, by just connecting the self-attacking arguments to any other argument.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Coming back to our example and to stable semantics, the question remains whether {a mathematical formula}F2 can be turned into an equivalent analytic one?</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Later, for semantics Σ , we will also need upper bounds for the problem {a mathematical formula}Cred Σ 2 defined as follows: given afF and arguments a and b, does there exist an extension {a mathematical formula}S ∈ Σ (F) such that {a mathematical formula}{a,b} ⊆ S (see e.g.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This immediately means that for stage semantics there is an implicit conflict between {a mathematical formula}x¯ and {a mathematical formula}FC (argument a to be precise).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This also means that for semi-stable semantics there are no implicit conflicts between {a mathematical formula}x¯ and any argument from {a mathematical formula}FC.It remains to show that F indeed is analytic for semi-stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To this end we still need to investigate possible implicit conflicts between {a mathematical formula}FX and Y, between {a mathematical formula}FC and Y, as well as between {a mathematical formula}FX and {a mathematical formula}FC, and among arguments from {a mathematical formula}FC, as well as among arguments from Y.As mentioned before the range of any semi-stable extension will cover Y and {a mathematical formula}x¯ and either all of {a mathematical formula}FC or all of {a mathematical formula}FX.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let {a mathematical formula}S ∈ Σ Σ , i.e., there is some afF with {a mathematical formula} Σ (F)=S.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As by definition any afF is finite we can have at most finitely many implicit conflicts for semantics {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ {stb,stg}.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Each of them can be removed by repeated application of Proposition 32 for {a mathematical formula} Σ =stb.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Hence there is an analytic af{a mathematical formula}F ′ with {a mathematical formula} Σ (F ′ )=S, meaning that {a mathematical formula}S ∈ Σ stbx.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">For {a mathematical formula} Σ =stg semantics we know from [25] that there is an afG with {a mathematical formula}stb(G)=stg(G)=S.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Now, again, we can remove all implicit conflicts and end up with the stg-analytic af{a mathematical formula}G ′ with {a mathematical formula}stg(G ′ )=S.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Hence {a mathematical formula}S ∈ Σ stgx.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">(4) For the last part of the theorem recall that the exact translation for {a mathematical formula}sem → prf from [25] does not add any implicit conflicts between arguments from the original af.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">This construction is justified by the fact that for any simple graph G, {a mathematical formula}|MIS(G)|=|nai(dir(G))| and furthermore, as shown in [14, Propositions 4 and 5] naive and stable semantics coincide on the class of irreflexive and symmetric afs.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Applying Theorem 41 we obtain {a mathematical formula} Σ maxcon(n)=2 ⋅ 33 − 1+23 − 1=2 ⋅ 32+22=18+4=22.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">This means, G is an extremal af within the class of connected graphs.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">As an aside, in case of arbitrary frameworks, the maximal number of stable extensions given n arguments can be realized by deleting the mutual attacks between {a mathematical formula}a3 and {a mathematical formula}b3 as well as {a mathematical formula}b3 and {a mathematical formula}c3 (cf.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Recall that for a single connected component with n arguments the maximal number of Σ -extensions is denoted by {a mathematical formula} Σ maxcon(n) and its values are given by Theorem 41.</a>
