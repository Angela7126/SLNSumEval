<a href="#0" id="0">In the following lemma, we show that at least one enforcement set exists and that enforcement sets are always non-empty if {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref is not a stable labelling.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Both are important properties for sets of arguments characterising parts of an AF responsible that a preferred labelling is not stable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since by Lemma 1 a revision exists w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">any set of arguments and labelling, it follows that there exists a revision w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">an enforcement set by an enforcement labelling and that the revision has a stable labelling that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Lemma 8</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As for enforcement sets, at least one preventing set exists w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}LabArgpref and preventing sets are always non-empty if {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref is not a stable labelling.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Preventing sets have the following properties:</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Proof</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Assume there exists a revision {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ of {a mathematical formula}AF w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}Args by {a mathematical formula}LabArg and a revision labelling {a mathematical formula}LabArg ⊛ of {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ such that {a mathematical formula}LabArg ⊛ is a stable labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">By Definition 5, {a mathematical formula} ∃ A ∈ Argsprev such that A is illegally labelled by {a mathematical formula}LabArg in {a mathematical formula}AF.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Since {a mathematical formula}A ∈ Ar ∖ Args, it follows from Lemma 37 in Appendix A that A is illegally labelled by {a mathematical formula}LabArg ⊛ in {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Contradiction.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Example 26</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Consider again the SCUPs of {a mathematical formula}AF7 w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">its only preferred labelling {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref (see Example 24 on page 317).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Let {a mathematical formula}LabArg be the in – out labelling illustrated in Fig.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">16, which is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The set {a mathematical formula}{a,b,d,e} does not contain any argument from the SCUP {a mathematical formula}{c}.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">It is easy to see that there exists no revision {a mathematical formula}AF7 ⊛ of {a mathematical formula}AF7 w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">{a mathematical formula}{a,b,d,e} by {a mathematical formula}LabArg such that a revision labelling is a stable labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF7 ⊛ , since c will always be illegally labelled out.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Since a SCUP revision labelling is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref (because all arguments in SCUPs are labelled in or out by the SCUP revision labelling, but are labelled undec by {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref), it follows that there exists a preferred labelling of the SCUP revision that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">By Theorem 12, we know that if a revision has a stable labelling that is more committed than {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref, the set of arguments used for the revision must be a superset of some enforcement set.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Proof</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">By Proposition 16, there exists a labelling {a mathematical formula}LabArg of {a mathematical formula}AF with {a mathematical formula}LabArgpref ⊑ LabArg and {a mathematical formula}undec(LabArg)= ∅ such that, for all revisions {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ of {a mathematical formula}AF w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">S by {a mathematical formula}LabArg and all revision labellings {a mathematical formula}LabArg ⊛ of {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ , {a mathematical formula}LabArg ⊛ is a stable labelling of {a mathematical formula}AF ⊛ .</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">It then follows from Theorem 12 that there exists an enforcement set {a mathematical formula}Args w.r.t.</a>
