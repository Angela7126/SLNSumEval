<a href="#2" id="2">is the relation ⪰ on descriptors such that {a mathematical formula} Ξ ⪰ Ψ if and only if either (i) there is some X with {a mathematical formula}X ⊩ Ξ such that {a mathematical formula}X ≦ Y for all Y with {a mathematical formula}Y ⊩ Ψ , or (ii) Ψ is not satisfiable within the domain of ≦ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is the set specified by {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ , and it satisfies Ψ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Due to {a mathematical formula} Ψ ∪ Ξ ⊩ Ψ and counter-dominance we also have {a mathematical formula} Ψ ⪰ ( Ψ ∪ Ξ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For the other direction, let {a mathematical formula} Ψ ≃ Ψ ′ and let X be the unique belief set with {a mathematical formula}X ⊩ Ψ and {a mathematical formula}X ′ the unique belief set with {a mathematical formula}X ′ ⊩ Ψ ′ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Due to the definition of {a mathematical formula}tdb, the domain of {a mathematical formula} ≦ ′ is the set of belief sets specified by some {a mathematical formula} Ψ ˆ such that Ψ is satisfiable within the domain of ≦ , i.e.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula} ≦ ′ has the same domain as ≦ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since ≦ is descriptor-wellfounded, it follows from the definition of {a mathematical formula}tb ∘ that the domain of {a mathematical formula} ∘ i is the set of descriptors that are satisfiable within the domain of ≦ .</a>
