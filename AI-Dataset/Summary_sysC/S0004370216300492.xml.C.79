<a href="#0" id="0">We show that the conjunctive model includes linear combination as a special case, and that the more general model can account for non-compositional behaviours such as overextension, non-commutativity, preservation of necessity and impossibility of attributes and to some extent, attribute loss or emergence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Examples of theories proposed to account for such concept combination include prototype theory together with fuzzy set theory [51], conceptual spaces [19], and quantum probability [3], [9] approaches.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is argued in [25] that the failure of fuzzy set theory to adequately model human concept combination results from its failure to consider the intension of concepts, i.e., the attributes that the concept possesses.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In contrast, the conceptual spaces and the quantum approaches take intension into account, either by considering concepts as being comprised of a combination of properties,{sup:1} which are themselves embedded in a space of quality dimensions, or by incorporating context into the model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Lawry and Tang [33] combine random set theory with conceptual spaces [19] and prototype theory [43], to give a formalisation of concepts as based on a prototype and an uncertain distance threshold, located in a conceptual space.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Section 4 introduces a framework for concept combination based on a hierarchy of conceptual spaces, and in which compound concepts are defined within Boolean spaces.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Elements from an underlying metric space then have graded membership in a concept depending on their similarity to a set of prototypical cases.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Fuzzy set theory [49] was proposed as a calculus for combining and modifying concepts with graded membership, and these ideas were then extended [51] to linguistic variables, these being variables taking words as values, rather than numbers.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The variable relates to an underlying universe of discourse Ω , which for the concept ‘ tall ’ could be {a mathematical formula}R+.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then each value L of the variable is associated with a fuzzy subset of Ω , and a function {a mathematical formula} Μ L: Ω → [0,1] associates with each {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Ω the value of its membership in L. Prototype theory gives a semantics for fuzzy set theory through the notion of similarity to a prototype, as described in [15].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this context, concepts are represented by fuzzy sets and membership of an element in a concept is quantified by its degree of similarity to the prototype.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Elements {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Ω that are very good examples of the concept L have membership close to 1, whereas elements x that are bad examples of the concept have membership close to 0.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In contrast, conceptual space and quantum models are able to represent the intension of concepts, since in each case, a concept is viewed as being embedded in a multidimensional space, whose dimensions are, in some sense, the required attributes.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The distance measure can be used to formulate a measure of similarity, as needed for prototype theory, according to which similar objects are close together in the conceptual space and very different objects are far apart.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The formal rule for concept combination is then that the combination CD of two concepts C and D is determined by letting the regions for the domains of C confined to the contrast class defined by D, replace the values of the corresponding regions for D. So in the example of ‘ red wine ’ , the space of colours has been restricted by the noun ‘ wine ’ to a subset of the full colour space with the same geometry.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Adams and Raubal [2] give a fairly straightforward formalisation of Gärdenfors's account, within which a conceptual space consists of a 6-tuple of domains, concepts, instances, contrast classes, contexts, and a similarity sensitivity parameter.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In [2], Adams and Raubal go on to define three types of concept combination: property – concept, concept – concept and contrast – class – concept combination and give algorithms for the implementation of each type of combination.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">It is defined by:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Cab is the value of the correlation between properties a and b on concept C.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">For example, suppose our context is the set {a mathematical formula}{red,round} and our objects are {a mathematical formula}C1=apple, {a mathematical formula}C2=cricketball.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">So, for example, the adjective ‘ big ’ can be applied in the combinations Adj-Noun or Noun-Copula-Adj, and has the semantic effect that it can be applied to physical objects and limits the normalised value of the size property to greater than 0.75.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In the work we present here we focus on intersective adjectives, since as pointed out in [27] even these require work to clarify how typicality functions in a composite concept, and therefore we do examine the difference in semantic types.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Based on these lists of attributes, the second experiment asked participants how useful each attribute was in defining the concept, as measured on the scale shown in Table 2 (the numerical value was imposed later rather than given by participants).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Furthermore, our framework is a natural extension of the conceptual spaces model in which the importance of certain dimensions is related to their necessity as defined by possibility theory [16].</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">In this framework, agents use a set of labels {a mathematical formula}L={L1,L2,...,Ln} to describe an underlying conceptual space Ω which has a distance metric {a mathematical formula}d(x,y) between points.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Each label {a mathematical formula}Li is entirely defined by its prototype {a mathematical formula}Pi, the distance metric in the space {a mathematical formula}d(x,y) and the distribution {a mathematical formula} Δ i of the threshold {a mathematical formula} Ε i.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">We can therefore, given a particular conceptual space Ω , use the notation {a mathematical formula}Li=<Pi,di, Δ i> to completely describe the label {a mathematical formula}Li.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">A similarity relation between points in a conceptual space may be defined as a decreasing function of distance in the space.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Gärdenfors gives the example that the similarity {a mathematical formula}s(x,y) between two points x and y in the conceptual space is an exponentially decaying function of the distance {a mathematical formula}d(x,y) between the two points, i.e.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">In terms of the prototype-threshold approach outlined above, the membership of an element x in a concept L may then be defined as the similarity to the prototype P of L, where {a mathematical formula} Ε ∼ Exp(c).</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">From this perspective, each of the attribute labels can form a binary dimension which are then combined to form the space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n where n is the number of attributes.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">We show that if the threshold of the compound concept in the binary combination space is uniformly distributed, the membership function for the compound concept is shown to be a weighted sum of the membership functions of the individual labels.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Lastly, we will show that under certain conditions, the importance of an attribute in a conjunction of two compound concepts can be calculated as the weighted sum of the importances of the individual attributes, directly mirroring Hampton's results.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Consider a set of distinct integral domains {a mathematical formula} Ω 1, … , Ω n, such as the CIELab colour space, size, and taste.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">We also allow some deviation from the prototype by taking into account the different levels of importance of each label {a mathematical formula}Li.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">We say that an element {a mathematical formula}X → ∈ {0,1}n can be appropriately described by the concept Α iff {a mathematical formula}d(x → Α ,X → ) ≤ Ε with the membership function defined by:{a mathematical formula} We can then relate membership in {a mathematical formula} Ω 1× Ω 2×...× Ω n to membership in the binary space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n as follows.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Now by total probability we have that:{a mathematical formula} We may assume that {a mathematical formula}Z → and {a mathematical formula}Y → are conditionally independent given {a mathematical formula}X → , since {a mathematical formula}Z → is defined purely in terms of {a mathematical formula}X → .</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Letting {a mathematical formula} Μ Α (Y → ) denote {a mathematical formula}P(Z=1|Y → ) and assuming independence of the dimensions {a mathematical formula}i=1...n we then have that:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">More generally, we can define a compound concept with prototypical case {a mathematical formula} Θ = ⋀ I±Li, where {a mathematical formula}I ⊆ {1,...,n}, as a triple {a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,d, Δ > where:{a mathematical formula}P is therefore a set of points which all have the same values on the dimension specified by the index set I, and cover all remaining possibilities across the dimensions not in I.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">We now outline a correspondence between our idea of a compound concept as a conjunction of attribute labels or their negations, and Hampton's account of concepts as combinations of attributes with individual weights.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">In contrast, our weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ → is always positive, and the idea of an attribute {a mathematical formula}Li being atypical or impossible is captured by the notion that the conjunction {a mathematical formula} ⋀ i=1n±Li includes {a mathematical formula}¬Li.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">In section 4.3.1 we show that as a special case, the membership function of a compound concept reduces to a weighted sum of the membership functions of the individual constituent concepts, thereby giving a mathematical grounding to the ideas proposed in [19] of seeing a concept as a weighted combination of properties, or in [50] of forming complex concepts via a mechanism of convex combination.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">However, we show that by restricting the type of membership function used in the binary combination space, we can derive an expression for the membership function {a mathematical formula} Μ Θ (Y → ) of the compound concept {a mathematical formula} Θ = ⋀ i=1k±Li, {a mathematical formula}k ≤ n as a weighted sum of the membership functions for individual domains {a mathematical formula} Μ ±Li(Yi).</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Theorem 4 grounds the idea that properties can be combined via a set of weights to form a concept, as proposed by Gärdenfors in [19], or the operation of convex combination proposed by Zadeh in [50].</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">Furthermore, the fact that we require specific conditions for the distribution of the threshold of the concept in the binary space is an advantage, since relaxing these conditions allows us to explain some of the characteristics of concept combination seen in psychological experiments, such as overextension or non-commutativity.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">In a space {a mathematical formula}Rn with the Euclidean distance metric, convexity of a set S is defined by the property that {a mathematical formula} ∀ x,y ∈ S, every point on the line segment connecting x and y is also in S. A detailed discussion is given [19] citing experimental evidence for the fact that concepts as used by humans tend to be convex, and that the use of convex concepts requires less cognitive load.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">In this case, the prototype P does not specify all values of {a mathematical formula}i=1...n. We firstly introduce some notation allowing us to talk about the set of dimensions in a prototype that remain invariant.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Let{a mathematical formula} Θ =<P,H Λ → , Δ >where P is convex with respect to{a mathematical formula}H Λ → .</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">Furthermore, let{a mathematical formula} Θ ′ =<P,H Λ ′ → , Δ >such that:{a mathematical formula}Then{a mathematical formula} Μ Θ (X → )= Μ Θ ′ (X → )Since P is convex we have that:{a mathematical formula} Therefore,{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">So with respect to membership in Θ in the binary space, the weight vector {a mathematical formula} Λ ′ produces the same results as the weight vector Λ .</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">These results show that a compound concept can be built up out of the weighted sum of individual concepts, provided that certain key conditions hold.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">So under certain conditions, the attribute weights in the conjunctive concept are a weighted sum of the attribute weights of the constituent concepts, which models one of Hampton's key findings as stated in section 4.1.</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">In addition to the general rule that the importance of attributes in the conjunction is the weighted sum of the importance of attributes in the constituent concepts, Hampton identifies four additional behaviours: necessity and impossibility are preserved; attribute loss or emergence is observed; conjunction is not commutative; and dominance effects are observed.</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">Recall that we view the impossibility of an attribute {a mathematical formula}Li as equivalent to the necessity of {a mathematical formula}¬Li, and we measure the necessity of an attribute or its negation using the notion of necessity from possibility theory as outlined in Definition 13.</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">We also introduce an alternative definition of the importance of an attribute, consistent with our random set based conceptual models.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">Rather than simply consider the weight {a mathematical formula} Λ → to be the importance of the attribute, we use the idea of necessity from possibility theory [16].</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">The possibility of a set of states A is then defined in [16] to be:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">Within our model, a state s is considered to be a particular point {a mathematical formula}X → in the binary combination space {a mathematical formula}{0,1}n and {a mathematical formula} Π (X → ):= Μ Θ (X → ).</a>
<a href="#57" id="57">To examine the necessity of a dimension in a conjunction of two compound concepts, we relate the distribution of the threshold Ε in the higher level binary space to the neighbourhood in the first level binary space.</a>
<a href="#58" id="58">When the distribution of Ε is defined over a narrower range than {a mathematical formula}[0,wT], the importance of attributes in the combined concept is higher than the importance of attributes in either constituent concept, as seen in Fig.</a>
<a href="#59" id="59">This gives:{a mathematical formula}Suppose the two concepts PET and {a mathematical formula}FISH are combined in a higher level binary combination space with prototype {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1), dimension weights {a mathematical formula} Λ → =[0.5,0.5] and {a mathematical formula} Ε ∼ U(0,1.25).</a>
