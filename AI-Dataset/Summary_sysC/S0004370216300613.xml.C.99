<a href="#0" id="0">Understanding via empirical experimentation how to effectively combine various types of clustering features allows us to seamlessly export our system to other datasets and languages.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The result is a simple but highly competitive system which obtains state of the art results across five languages and twelve datasets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Most NERC taggers are supervised statistical systems that extract patterns and term features which are considered to be indications of Named Entity (NE) types using the manually annotated training data (extracting orthographic, linguistic and other types of evidence) and often external knowledge resources.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As in other NLP tasks, supervised statistical NERC systems are more robust and obtain better performance on available evaluation sets, although sometimes the statistical models can also be combined with specific rules for some NE types.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In other words, combining and stacking different types of clustering features induced over a variety of data sources should help to capture more similarities between different words in the training and test sets, increasing the contribution to the weights of the model parameters in the training process.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Contrary to previous suggestions that the larger the number of classes and the corpus used to induced the clusters the better [60], our results provide a number of interesting pointers to choose the appropriate type of corpus and clustering method required for optimal performance.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, the named entity ‘ Uzbekistan ’ is not present in the English CoNLL 2003 training data, whereas in the test set can be found four times, all of them locations.</a>
