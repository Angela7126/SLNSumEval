<a href="#0" id="0">Consider the social network {a mathematical formula}S of Example 1 and the GAP {a mathematical formula} Π hiv of Example 3.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let Π be the GAP modeling both the SN and the diffusion model, i.e., {a mathematical formula} Π = Π S ∪ Π hiv.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Diffusion centrality tries to measure how well a vertex v can diffuse a property p (e.g., the {a mathematical formula}hiv property).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Diffusion centralityLet {a mathematical formula}S=(V,E,VL, Ω ) be an SN, Π a GAP, and p a property.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The diffusion centrality (DC for short) of a vertex {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Whenever Π , p, and {a mathematical formula}S are clear from the context, we denote the diffusion centrality of a vertex v simply as {a mathematical formula}dc(v).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Recall that the only vertex with property {a mathematical formula}hiv is b.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given an SN {a mathematical formula}S=(V,E,VL, Ω ), a GAP Π , and a property p, the diffusion centrality problem consists of finding the DC (w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Π , p, and {a mathematical formula}S) of every vertex of {a mathematical formula}S.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Consider a vertex {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Consider the diffusion model {a mathematical formula} Π hiv from Example 3:{a mathematical formula} Suppose v is a vertex with no {a mathematical formula}sp relations (in a given SN).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">A vertex of {a mathematical formula}S is necessary if it activates a rule of {a mathematical formula} Π p, otherwise it is unnecessary.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Since this is the case, then Π is {a mathematical formula}hiv-monotonic.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Recall that, given a GAP Π and a property p, then {a mathematical formula} Π p is the set of rules r in Π such that either p depends on the head predicate symbol of r or p is the head predicate symbol.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Then, {a mathematical formula} Π p ∖ Π p ⁎ can be evaluated.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Consider the GAP {a mathematical formula} Π hiv of Example 3 and the SN of Example 1 (cf.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">2 shows the diffusion hypergraph for the GAP {a mathematical formula} Π hiv of Example 3 and the social network of Example 1.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In this case, the diffusion centrality of vertex v is {a mathematical formula}sump ′ − (sump − F[p][v]).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Here, we consider the fact that the diffusion of the property p can rapidly decrease according to the distance of vertices in {a mathematical formula}Vv from the diffusion source vertex v.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">HyperDC is much faster than betweenness and closeness centrality for all the STEAM networks and for all values of {a mathematical formula} Δ q.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Even when {a mathematical formula} Δ q=30%, the runtime of HyperDC is still low.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">We see that irrespective of the diffusion model used and the value of {a mathematical formula} Δ q, HyperDC runs in linear time in practice.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Higher values of {a mathematical formula} Δ q lead to higher running times, because when more vertices have property q, diffusion unfolds more and thus HyperDC takes more time to converge to the least fixed point.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">By the expected number of vertices with property p for an SN {a mathematical formula}S after diffusion of Π we mean {a mathematical formula} ∑ v ∈ Vlfp( Π ∪ Π S)(p(v)), where V is the set of vertices of {a mathematical formula}S. Our spread experiments are presented in two ways.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">We varied {a mathematical formula} Δ q over the set {a mathematical formula}{1%,2%,3%,4%,5%,10%,15%,20%,25%,30%}.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Then for a fixed {a mathematical formula} Δ q,k,Diffusion – Model triple, we computed the ratio of the spread using DC to the best spread achieved by any of the classical centrality measures.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">{a mathematical formula} Δ q for Case 1 above.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">In all the experiments we set {a mathematical formula} Δ p=0 and {a mathematical formula} Δ q=5%.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The time ratios are always less than one in all networks and for all diffusion models with the exception of the Jackson – Yariv model in the huge network GAME220 with {a mathematical formula}k=2000.</a>
