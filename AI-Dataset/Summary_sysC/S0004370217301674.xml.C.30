<a href="#0" id="0">A multi-agent methodology is proposed for Decentralized Reinforcement Learning (DRL) of individual behaviors in problems where multi-dimensional action spaces are involved.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When using this methodology, sub-tasks are learned in parallel by individual agents working toward a common goal.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In addition to proposing this methodology, three specific multi agent DRL approaches are considered: DRL-Independent, DRL Cooperative-Adaptive (CA), and DRL-Lenient.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For instance, by considering a system with M actuators (an M-dimensional action space) and N discrete actions in each one, a DRL modeling leads to evaluating and storing NM values per state instead of {a mathematical formula}NM as a centralized RL does.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since from a computational point of view, all the individual agents in a DRL system can operate in parallel acting upon their individual and reduced action spaces, the learning speed is typically higher compared to a centralized agent which searches an exponentially larger action space {a mathematical formula}N=N1× ⋯ ×NM, as expressed in (2)[39].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the centralized modeling for the 3DMC problem, a global reward function is proposed as: {a mathematical formula}r=0 if the common goal is reached, {a mathematical formula}r= − 1otherwise.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the DRL scheme, individual reward functions can be defined as: {a mathematical formula}rx=0 if East top is reached, {a mathematical formula}rx= − 1otherwise, for the {a mathematical formula}Agentx, and {a mathematical formula}ry=0 if north top is reached; {a mathematical formula}ry= − 1otherwise, for the {a mathematical formula}Agenty.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Once the global DRL modeling has been defined and the tuples state, action, and reward {a mathematical formula}[Sm,Am,Rm] are well identified per every agent {a mathematical formula}m=1, ⋯ ,M, it is necessary to complete each single RL modeling.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Implementation and environmental details such as ranges and boundaries of features, terminal states, and reset conditions must be defined, as well as RL algorithms and parameters selected.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If individual sub-tasks and their goals are well identified, modeling each individual agent implies the same procedure as in a classical RL system.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Algorithm 1 is described for the most general case of a fully-decentralized system with individual rewards, where states and rewards are annotated as {a mathematical formula}sm and {a mathematical formula}rm respectively, but it is also possible to implement a joint state vector or common reward DRL systems.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In addition, note that RL parameters could have been defined separately per agent ({a mathematical formula} Α m, Γ m), which is one of the DRL properties remarked in Section 2.3, but in Algorithm 1 they appear unified just for the sake of simplicity.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">6 presents learning evolution plots and Table 4 shows the best policy final performances.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">All the DRL systems implemented improved the {a mathematical formula}%ofScoredGoals of the centralized one as in the learning evolution traces (Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">6), as well as in the final performance test (Table 4).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Except from the Incremental Cooperative Adaptive implementation, DRL-CAinc, the DRL implementations accelerated the learning time of the CRL scheme.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Although DRL-CAinc achieves better performances than CRL after episode 500, the slower learning of the DRL-CAinc can be explained by taking the incremental cooperative adaptation effect into account, which updates the Q function conservatively during early episodes in which the agents do not have good policies.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Stage3.4 — Determining if the problem is fully decentralizable: since the three state variables, {a mathematical formula}[ Ρ , Γ , Φ ] of the joint vector state are required, this problem is not considered to be fully decentralizable.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">So, the proposed modeling for learning the 3-Dimensional velocity vector from the joint observed state is detailed in Table 5.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Since 17 discrete actions per agent are implemented for the DRL system, if an equivalent CRL system were implemented, that centralized agent would search in an action space of {a mathematical formula}173=4913 possible actions, which would be enormous for most of the RL algorithms.</a>
