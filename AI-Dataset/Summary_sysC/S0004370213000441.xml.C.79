<a href="#0" id="0">Agents form beliefs {a mathematical formula}b(0) in the form of a probability distribution over the opponent ʼ s actions {a mathematical formula}Aj for every game state, such that {a mathematical formula}b(0)(aj;s) represents what the agent believes to be the probability that his opponent will play action {a mathematical formula}aj ∈ Aj given that the game is in situation {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For a {a mathematical formula}ToM0 agent, the belief structure {a mathematical formula}b(0) represents the extent of his beliefs concerning his opponent ʼ s behaviour.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given the game ʼ s payoff function and his beliefs about the way his opponent plays the game, a {a mathematical formula}ToM0 agent is able to assign a subjective value {a mathematical formula} Φ i(ai;b(0),s) to playing a certain action {a mathematical formula}ai ∈ Ai in game state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S, given his beliefs {a mathematical formula}b(0) concerning his opponent ʼ s behaviour.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The value {a mathematical formula} Φ i(ai;b(0),s) that the focal agent i assigns to playing action {a mathematical formula}ai in game state s, based on his belief {a mathematical formula}b(0) concerning his opponent ʼ s behaviour, is given by{a mathematical formula} We assume that agents choose rationally given their beliefs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The agent ʼ s first-order theory of mind predicts that his opponent will select the action that will yield her the highest payoff.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The agent then integrates his first-order beliefs {a mathematical formula}b(1), which he believes to correspond to his opponent ʼ s zero-order beliefs, with the prediction that he will play R.{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} These integrated beliefs specify what the agent believes what his opponent ʼ s beliefs are concerning his actions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, based on application of his second-order theory of mind, the {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent believes that his opponent believes that there is an 88% probability that he himself will play R. From the viewpoint of his opponent, the agent then determines what the value would be for playing each of the possible actions, given the integrated beliefs of opponent action.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The action that maximizes this value represents the agent ʼ s prediction of the action his opponent is going to play according to his second-order theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula} Based on second-order theory of mind, the agent therefore believes his opponent will play P.To make a decision, the agent integrates his zero-order beliefs {a mathematical formula}b(0), his first-order prediction {a mathematical formula}a ˆ j(1)=P (see Example 2), and his second-order prediction {a mathematical formula}a ˆ j(2)=P.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Example 2 shows how the agent ʼ s zero-order beliefs and his first-order prediction of opponent behaviour are integrated.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Using this confidence {a mathematical formula}c2, the agent also integrates his belief that his opponent is going to play P. In this example, the agent has confidence {a mathematical formula}c2=0.1 in second-order theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This results in the following integrated beliefs:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Based on these integrated beliefs, the agent determines the value for playing each of the actions.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The agent then chooses to play the action that maximizes the value.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In this case:{a mathematical formula} Based on his integrated beliefs of what the opponent is going to do, the {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent ʼ s choice is to play S.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For every order of theory of mind available to the agent beyond the second-order, say order k, the agent maintains an additional belief structure {a mathematical formula}b(k).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">These beliefs are used to expand his decision process by modeling the decision process of a {a mathematical formula}(k − 1)st-order theory of mind agent from his opponent ʼ s point of view.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The resulting prediction is weighted against the decision process of {a mathematical formula}(k − 1)st-order of theory of mind from his own point of view.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">(12), becomes{a mathematical formula}Table 8 shows that {a mathematical formula}a ˆ j(2)=P=a ˜ j, and thus that second-order theory of mind also correctly predicted that the opponent would play P. However, since first-order theory of mind is of a lower order than second-order theory of mind, and since first-order theory of mind also correctly predicted the action of the opponent, the confidence {a mathematical formula}c2 in second-order theory of mind remains unchanged.The actions that were actually played by the agent and his opponent also change the agent ʼ s beliefs.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">This causes a {a mathematical formula}ToM0 agent with low learning speed to play the action that he weakly believes to be a slightly better choice than the rest.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">This also makes it more difficult for a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 opponent to predict which token the {a mathematical formula}ToM0 agent with low learning speed will play, since his choice is not robust against small deviations in his beliefs.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">7c shows that the {a mathematical formula}ToM3 agent does not have this difficulty when playing ERPS against a similar opponent.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Since the richer action space of ERPS increases performance of the {a mathematical formula}ToM3 agent when playing against an opponent that does not learn, the structure of the game influences the effectiveness of theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">However, performance of a {a mathematical formula}ToM3 agent playing ERPS against a {a mathematical formula}ToM2 opponent is still poor in comparison to performance of the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 and {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agents playing ERPS against opponents of a lower order of theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Although the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 and {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agents clearly outperform opponents of a lower order of theory of mind, the {a mathematical formula}ToM3 agent outperforms the {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent at a small margin only.</a>
