<a href="#19" id="19">GFODD equivalenceGiven diagrams {a mathematical formula}B1 and {a mathematical formula}B2 (with the same aggregation functions) and integer N in unary: return Yes iff for all I with at most N objects, {a mathematical formula}MAPB1(I)=MAPB2(I).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Definition 11</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">GFODD edge removalGiven diagrams {a mathematical formula}B1 and {a mathematical formula}B2 (with the same aggregation functions), where {a mathematical formula}B2 can be obtained from {a mathematical formula}B1 by redirecting one edge to a zero valued leaf, and given integer N in unary: return Yes iff for all I with at most N objects, {a mathematical formula}MAPB1(I)=MAPB2(I).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Proof</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">GFODD Equivalence and GFODD Edge Removal for diagrams with aggregation depth k (where{a mathematical formula}k ≥ 2) are{a mathematical formula} Π k+1P-complete.By Corollary 18, it suffices to show that this holds for max-k-alternating GFODDs.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Since Edge Removal is a special case of Equivalence it suffices to show membership for Equivalence and hardness for Edge Removal.To show membership we show that the complement, nonequivalence, is in {a mathematical formula} Σ k+1P.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Given two max-k-alternating GFODDs {a mathematical formula}B1 and {a mathematical formula}B2 as input, we guess an interpretation I of the appropriate size, and then appeal to an oracle for GFODD Evaluation to calculate {a mathematical formula}MAPB1(I) and {a mathematical formula}MAPB2(I).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Using these values we return Yes or No accordingly.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">To calculate the map values, let B be one of these diagrams, and let the leaf values of the diagram be {a mathematical formula}v1,v2, … ,v ℓ .</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">We make ℓ calls to GFODD Evaluation with {a mathematical formula}(B,I,vi) as input.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Each call requires an oracle in {a mathematical formula} Σ kP and {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I) is the largest value on which the oracle returns Yes.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Clearly if a witness for nonequivalence exists then this process can discover it and say Yes (per non-equivalence), and otherwise it will always say No.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Therefore non-equivalence is in {a mathematical formula}NP Σ kP, that is {a mathematical formula} Σ k+1P and equivalence is in {a mathematical formula} Π k+1P.We reduce QBF satisfiability with {a mathematical formula}k ≥ 3 alternations of quantifiers to equivalence of max-{a mathematical formula}(k − 1)-alternating GFODDs.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">The reduction is conceptually similar to the one from the previous theorem but the details are more involved.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Proof</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">GFODD Value for diagrams with aggregation depth k (where{a mathematical formula}k ≥ 2) is{a mathematical formula} Σ k+1P-complete.The proof of Theorem 16 goes through almost directly and requires only a slight wording variation.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">For membership we get the bound on interpretation size by the assumption on the input; then the algorithm is the same.For the reduction, we use Theorem 1 to calculate {a mathematical formula}B=Apply(B1,B2,+).</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">As stated in that theorem, we can mesh together the aggregation lists of {a mathematical formula}B1 and {a mathematical formula}B2 interleaving the max and min blocks from each diagram without increasing quantifier depth and the diagram B has the same quantifier prefix and depth as those of {a mathematical formula}B1 and {a mathematical formula}B2.</a>
