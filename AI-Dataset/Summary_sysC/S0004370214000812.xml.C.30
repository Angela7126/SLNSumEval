<a href="#0" id="0">Said more intuitively, once the nodes in the most influential set S follow the behavior {a mathematical formula}xS prescribed to them by a desired stable outcome x achieving the goal of interest, they become collectively “ so influential ” that their behavior “ forces ” every other individual to a unique choice of behavior!</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, {a mathematical formula}xi ∈ { − 1,1} denotes the behavior of individual i, where {a mathematical formula}xi=1 indicates that i “ adopts ” a particular behavior and {a mathematical formula}xi= − 1 indicates i “ does not adopt ” the behavior.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, for all individuals i and any possible behavior {a mathematical formula}x − i ∈ { − 1,1}n − 1 of the other individuals in the population, the best-response behavior{a mathematical formula}xi ⁎ of individual i to the behavior {a mathematical formula}x − i ⁎ of others satisfies{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Informally, “ positive influences ” lead an individual to adopt the behavior, while “ negative influences ” lead the individual to “ reject ” the behavior; the individual is indifferent if there is “ no influence. ” We formally characterize the stable outcomes of the system by the following notion of pure-strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE) of the corresponding general-influence game.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We adopt general-influence games as the model of strategic behavior among the individuals.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If, in particular, the individuals are nodes in a network, then we define a graphical-game version of the general-influence game as follows.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Network Influence GamesA network influence game with directed graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) is a general-influence game with players represented by the nodes V and the influence function {a mathematical formula}fi of each player/node {a mathematical formula}i ∈ V represented by a local potential function{a mathematical formula}filocal:{ − 1,+1}|Pa(i)| → R, such that {a mathematical formula}fi(x − i) ≡ filocal(xPa(i)), where {a mathematical formula}Pa(i) ≡ {j ∈ V|(j,i) ∈ E} are the parents of i in G, and {a mathematical formula}xPa(i) is the joint-action of the parents of i consistent with {a mathematical formula}x − i.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An example of a goal function g that captures the objective of achieving a specific stable outcome {a mathematical formula}x ⁎ ∈ NE(G) is {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ 1[x=x ⁎ ].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Another example that captures the objective of achieving a stable outcome with the largest number of individuals adopting the behavior 1 is {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ ∑ i=1nxi+12, or equivalently, {a mathematical formula}g(x,S) ≡ ∑ i=1nxi.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given an LIG and a number{a mathematical formula}k ≥ 1, it is NP-complete to decide if there exists a PSNE with at least k players playing the action 1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Given an LIG and a designated set of{a mathematical formula}k ≥ 1players, it is co-NP-complete to decide if there exists a unique PSNE with those players playing the action 1.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We set the threshold of each node to 0.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We observe that for {a mathematical formula}0<p<1, these games have very few PSNE, while for {a mathematical formula}p=0 and {a mathematical formula}p=1 the number of PSNE is considerably larger than that.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Yet, out of purely scientific curiosity and suggestions/feedback about our work, we present preliminary results based on a heuristic for the problem of most influential nodes in our context (i.e., LIGs) that we designed by adapting what is arguably the most popular and simple greedy-selection algorithm for identifying “ most influential ” nodes developed specifically for the cascade model of diffusion [49].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The simplicity of the original algorithm in the diffusion context facilitates the adaptation to our context.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Note however that this adaptation is exclusive to a very specific instance of our general problem formulation: identifying “ most influential nodes ” with respect to the goal being maximizing the number of +1's in the PSNE (see Definition 3.6 in Section 3.2 for a definition and discussion of our problem formulation and the role that the “ objective function ” {a mathematical formula}g(.)</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Given the set {a mathematical formula}S of all stable outcomes (i.e., PSNE) and a subset of {a mathematical formula}C of these stable outcomes, find a minimal set T of players such that{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}PS(V) is the set of PSNE-extensions of the nodes in V playing action 1, i.e.,{a mathematical formula}</a>
