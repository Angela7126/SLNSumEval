<a href="#0" id="0">A qualitative constraint has the form {a mathematical formula}(xRy), which specifies that the two variables {a mathematical formula}x,y are related by the relation R. The consistency problem is to decide whether a set of qualitative constraints can be satisfied simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A qualitative constraint network Γ is called minimal if for each constraint {a mathematical formula}(xRy) in Γ , R is the minimal (i.e., the strongest) relation between x, y that is entailed by Γ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Suppose{a mathematical formula} Γ ={viTijvj:1 ≤ i,j ≤ n}is a qualitative constraint network over{a mathematical formula}M. If Γ is weakly globally consistent, then it is minimal.For every pair of variables {a mathematical formula}vi,vj ({a mathematical formula}i ≠ j) and every basic relation Α in {a mathematical formula}Tij, it is clear that {a mathematical formula}{vi Α vj} is a consistent scenario of {a mathematical formula} Γ ↓ {vi,vj}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is co-NP-complete to decide if{a mathematical formula}(xRy)is redundant in Γ .First of all, we note that {a mathematical formula}(xRy) is redundant in Γ iff {a mathematical formula}( Γ ∖ {(xRy)}) ∪ {xRcy} is inconsistent, where {a mathematical formula}Rc is the complement of R. Since it is NP-complete to decide if an RCC5/8 network is consistent, we know this redundancy problem (i.e., the problem of determining if a constraint is redundant in a network) is in co-NP.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The second result, stated in Proposition 28, shows that a particular constraint {a mathematical formula}(xRy) is redundant in Γ iff its corresponding constraint in {a mathematical formula} Γ p is redundant in {a mathematical formula} Γ p.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The weak composition of path Π is the qualitative relation in {a mathematical formula}M defined as{a mathematical formula} Since the weak composition operation is associative, the relation {a mathematical formula}CT( Π ) defined above is unambiguous.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We say a path Π is non-trivial if {a mathematical formula}CT( Π ) is not the universal relation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Suppose Γ is a consistent RCC5/8 network and{a mathematical formula}(xRy)a constraint in Γ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It is clear that the constraint {a mathematical formula}(v3PPv2) is redundant in {a mathematical formula} Γ p.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, {a mathematical formula}(v3PPv2) is not redundant in Γ .</a>
