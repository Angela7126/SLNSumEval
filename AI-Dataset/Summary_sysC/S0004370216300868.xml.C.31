<a href="#0" id="0">In an influence situation, a reward social power exists when the target (T) recognizes that the actor (A) can execute an action (ra) that the target positively values in exchange for the execution of the action that the actor intends the target to perform (C).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Rewards are based on resources such as money or social praise.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that the set of all possible rewarding actions that the actor can perform for the target are represented by the set {a mathematical formula}RewardingActionsA.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A reward social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the value that the target assigns to the rewarding action that the actor can perform ({a mathematical formula}Valuera), the target's achievement motivation ({a mathematical formula}AchievementMT) and the target's perception of the tendency of the actor to perform the rewarding action ({a mathematical formula}RewardingT,A,ra).</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">In an influence situation, a coercive social power exists when a target (T) recognizes that an actor (A) can execute a harmful action (ca) if the action underlying the influence interaction (C) is not performed by the target.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Coercions are based on resources such as money or gossip.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that the set of all possible harmful actions that the actor can perform against the target are represented by the set {a mathematical formula}CoerciveActionsA.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A coercive social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the value that the target assigns to the coercive action that the actor can perform ({a mathematical formula}Valueca), the target's achievement motivation ({a mathematical formula}AchievementMT) and the target's perception of the tendency of the actor to perform the coercive action ({a mathematical formula}CoercingT,A,ca).</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">A Responsibility norm specifies that an agent should help other members of the group who are dependent on that agent.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">When a social power is based on such a norm, as modeled by Formula (11), the corresponding bias is also proportionally affected by the degree of dependence {a mathematical formula}DependenceA,T,C{sup:16} of the actor agent on the target.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This bias is also a probability variable, where a value of 0 indicates that the actor does not depend at all on the target's performance of C and a value of 1 indicates that the actor strongly depends on the target's performance of C.{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">A referent social power as modeled in this work can be of one of two types: liking or status.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">A referent liking social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the strength of the liking that the target holds for the actor ({a mathematical formula}LikingT,A) and the target's personal affiliative motivation ({a mathematical formula}AffiliativeMT).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">This description is succinctly modeled by Formula (12).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The other type of referent social power is based on social status, which is defined as a representation of an individual's social prominence and respect [1].</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The referent status social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the actor's status ({a mathematical formula}StatusT,A,cat) as recognized by the target, the target's personal status motivation ({a mathematical formula}StatusMT) and the target's preference for the specific category of status held by the actor ({a mathematical formula}Importancecat).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">An expert social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the importance of the skill associated with that action ({a mathematical formula}Importances,C), the trust that the target agent holds for the actor agent ({a mathematical formula}TrustT,A) and the target's perception of the skill difference between the actor and the target ({a mathematical formula}LevelDA,T,s) regarding the skill associated with the action.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">This description is modeled by Formula (14).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Note that Skills represents the set of all known skills.</a>

<a href="#25" id="25">For Resistance/Control, we found that on average, the perception of the underlying social power force mechanism that the participants reported after playing the game with the SAPIENT agents ({a mathematical formula}M=1.45, {a mathematical formula}SE=0.35) was significantly higher than that reported after playing the game with the scripted agents ({a mathematical formula}M=0.44, {a mathematical formula}SE=0.24).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The results were {a mathematical formula}t(29)= − 2.48 for the dependent t-test, Benjamini – Hochberg significant ({a mathematical formula}FDR=0.1) with an effect size of {a mathematical formula}r=.07.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">For Expert Power, we found that the perception of the expert power experienced by the agents that the participants reported after playing the game with the SAPIENT agents ({a mathematical formula}Mdn=2.91) was significantly higher than that reported after playing the game with the scripted agents ({a mathematical formula}Mdn=1.47).</a>
