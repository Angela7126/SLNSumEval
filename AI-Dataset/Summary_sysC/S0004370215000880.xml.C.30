<a href="#3" id="3">Consider an assignment problem {a mathematical formula}(N,O, ≿ ) where {a mathematical formula}|N|=2, {a mathematical formula}O=o1,o2,o3,o4 and the preferences of the agents are as follows{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}Consider the discrete assignment p in which agent 1 gets {a mathematical formula}o1 and {a mathematical formula}o4 and agent 2 gets {a mathematical formula}o2 and {a mathematical formula}o3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The assignment p is not SD proportional or SD envy-free because the fairness constraints for agent 1 are not satisfied.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, p is weak SD proportional, possible envy-free, and weak SD envy-free.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Possible envy-freeness implies weak SD proportionality.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Assume an assignment p is not weak SD proportional.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By Theorem 2, p is not possible proportional.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Consider an assignment problem with two agents with preferences {a mathematical formula}1:{a},{b,c} and {a mathematical formula}2:{a,b,c}.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then the assignment in which 1 gets a and 2 gets b and c is possible envy-free.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However it is not SD proportional, because agent 1's allocation does not SD dominate the uniform allocation.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}m=nand it is possible to allocate to each agent an object that is not his least preferred object;{a mathematical formula}m>n.Moreover, it can be checked in polynomial time whether a weak SD proportional discrete assignment exists when agents have strict preferences.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">An assignment p is weak SD proportional if and only if for each{a mathematical formula}i ∈ N,</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Consider the following assignment problem:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The discrete assignment that gives {a mathematical formula}{b,c,f} to agent 1 and {a mathematical formula}{d,e,a} to agent 2 is SD proportional.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">However it is not Pareto optimal since it is SD-dominated by the assignment in which agent 1 gets {a mathematical formula}{a,b,c} and agent 2 gets {a mathematical formula}{d,e,f}.</a>
