<a href="#0" id="0">Apart from the quality of the heuristic, we also need to consider the computational effort required to compute it.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As red – black planning generalizes monotonic planning – the special case where all variables are painted red – and optimal monotonic planning is {a mathematical formula}NP-hard [7], optimal red – black planning also is (at least) {a mathematical formula}NP-hard.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, in analogy to commonly used relaxed plan heuristics, we will generate an (inadmissible) heuristic function by generating some, not necessarily optimal, red – black plan.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For ease of presentation, in what follows we assume that actions {a mathematical formula}AvB affecting {a mathematical formula}vB are also all preconditioned by the value of {a mathematical formula}vB; this assumption is without loss of generality because any action {a mathematical formula}a ∈ AvB with no precondition on {a mathematical formula}vB can be replaced with k actions that are preconditioned on different values of {a mathematical formula}vB, and otherwise are identical to a.A straightforward property of {a mathematical formula}RB tasks with a single black variable that plays an important role in the proof is that the outside conditions of all the actions {a mathematical formula}AvB are all red.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, in particular, once an action from {a mathematical formula}AvB is applied along a plan for Π , it can then be re-applied any time, as long as its inside condition on the value of {a mathematical formula}vB is satisfied.Now, let {a mathematical formula} Π += 〈 a1, … ,an 〉 be a relaxed plan for Π , i.e., a plan for the monotonic relaxation {a mathematical formula} Π + of our {a mathematical formula}RB task Π , and, for {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ i ≤ n, let {a mathematical formula} Π +i= 〈 a1, … ,ai 〉 denote the corresponding prefix of {a mathematical formula} Π +.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Focusing on the structure of {a mathematical formula}CG Π B, let {a mathematical formula}RB-PlanExist(G) and {a mathematical formula}RB-PlanGen(G) be respectively the plan existence and plan generation problems restricted to {a mathematical formula}RB planning tasks whose black causal graphs are elements of{a mathematical formula}G. Note that these problems put no restriction on the structure of the causal graph itself beyond being a super-graph of some element of {a mathematical formula}G. Theorem 5 below refines the complexity characterization for {a mathematical formula}RB with respect to the structure of the black causal graph, providing a valuable fragment of tractability via Theorem 1, and establishing {a mathematical formula}P/NPdichotomies for both general {a mathematical formula}RB, as well as for {a mathematical formula}RB restricted to fixed-size domain variables.</a>
