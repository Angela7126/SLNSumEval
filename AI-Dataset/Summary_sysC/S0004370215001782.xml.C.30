<a href="#0" id="0">Term translation is of great importance for machine translation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this article, we investigate three issues of term translation in the context of statistical machine translation and propose three corresponding models: (a) a term translation disambiguation model which selects desirable translations for terms in the source language with domain information, (b) a term translation consistency model that encourages consistent translations for terms with a high strength of translation consistency throughout a document, and (c) a term unithood model that rewards translation hypotheses where source terms are translated into target strings as a whole unit.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Term Translation Disambiguation Model: In this model, we condition the translations of source terms in different documents on the topic distributions of corresponding documents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In doing so, we enable the decoder to favor translation hypotheses with topic-specific term translations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, we elaborate the three models proposed for term translation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">They are the (A) term translation disambiguation model, (B) term translation consistency model and (C) term unithood model respectively.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For the bilingual term bank created from training data, we first group each source term and all its corresponding target terms into a 2-tuple {a mathematical formula}G 〈 tf,Set(te) 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}tf is the source term and {a mathematical formula}Set(te) is the set of {a mathematical formula}tf's corresponding target terms.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">These suggest that the consistency of term translation is topic-sensitive.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The same terms may be translated in a different consistency pattern in different topics.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore we calculate the translation consistency strength of a source term {a mathematical formula}tf based on topic distributions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We can also integrate the three models into SMT one-by-one with the term counting feature.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, we can only integrate the term translation disambiguation model into SMT as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">What's the impact of the topic number k on the term translation disambiguation and consistency models that explore document-level topic information?</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">What's the impact of the size of extracted bilingual term bank on the term translation disambiguation and consistency model?</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In this section, we thoroughly validated the effectiveness of the proposed term translation disambiguation model, consistency model and unithood model respectively.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We also compared our term translation consistency model against another two models.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Although these two models are better than the baseline and the “ CountFeat ” method as shown in Table 12, they are worse than our term translation consistency model.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Our model outperforms the “ Cons-Count ” model by up to 0.33 BLEU points.</a>
