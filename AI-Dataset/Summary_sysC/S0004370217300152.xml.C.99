<a href="#0" id="0">Note that, for any normalized capacity v and any set {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ N, we have:{a mathematical formula} This is due to the fact that all “ bottom ” criteria precede all “ top ” criteria in the permutation, and so the difference of performance between any two successive criteria is equal to zero, except for the last “ bottom ” criterion and the first “ top ” criterion, which is equal to one (refer to Definition 3).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The constraints derived from the answers indeed allow us to approximate the capacity values {a mathematical formula}v(A),A ⊆ N, as close as we want.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, we necessarily have {a mathematical formula}{A ′ ∈ A:A ′ ⊂ A} ⊂ {B ′ ∈ A:B ′ ⊂ B}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, using Equation (10), we have:{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since sets belonging to {a mathematical formula}A(x,y) are the only ones that appear in the objective function of PL1, then by applying Proposition 1 to set {a mathematical formula}A=A(x,y), we know that {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) can be solved by considering only monotonicity constraints involving variables {a mathematical formula}vA, {a mathematical formula}A ∈ A(x,y).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, we can compute {a mathematical formula}PMR(x,y, Θ P) by solving the following simpler linear program:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, the objective function can be written {a mathematical formula} ∑ A ∈ A(x,y) Ω AvA where:{a mathematical formula} Note that we cannot have {a mathematical formula}X(i)=Y(j) if i is different from j since these level sets can only be equal if they have the same cardinality.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note also that all variables {a mathematical formula}vA,A ∈ A(x,y), such that {a mathematical formula} Ω A=0 have no impact on the objective function of program LP2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Therefore, using Proposition 1, these variables can be removed from program LP2 leading to a simplified version of this program.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Indeed, we have {a mathematical formula} Θ P ′ ⊆ Θ P for any set of preference statements {a mathematical formula}P ′ ⊇ P; then, for any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X and any {a mathematical formula} ℓ ∈ {1, … ,q}, we have:{a mathematical formula} and so, the maximum minimax regret cannot increase by adding new preference statements; in the subsection devoted to numerical tests, we will see that, in practice, it strictly decreases when queries are chosen in a reasoned way.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Using Proposition 1 with {a mathematical formula}A=Ax, from the linear program we can remove all monotonicity constraints involving a variable {a mathematical formula}vA that is not present in the objective function of Equation (26) (i.e.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}vA ∉ Ax), as they play no role in the optimization; we then obtain a more compact formulation with only n variables and {a mathematical formula}n − 1 constraints given here below:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To do so, it is sufficient to prove by induction that the following statement, denoted by {a mathematical formula}P(i), holds at the end of any step {a mathematical formula}i ∈ {0, … ,|A − |} of the ‘ for ’ loop: “ The instantiation of the variables in {a mathematical formula}{vAk − ,1 ≤ k ≤ i} , denoted by {a mathematical formula}Ii, can be extended to an optimal solution of program LP3. ” If statement {a mathematical formula}P(i) is true for {a mathematical formula}i=|A − |, then it enables us to establish the result: the instantiation of all negative variables (i.e.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Note that we necessarily have {a mathematical formula}I(Dji) ∩ A+= ∅ since {a mathematical formula}Dji ∈ A+ and {a mathematical formula}A+ is an embedded sequence.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, we have {a mathematical formula}I(Dji) ⊆ A − which means that {a mathematical formula} Ω A<0 for all {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I(Dji); hence, the objective function of problem (34) increases as variable {a mathematical formula}vA decreases.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We want to prove that there exists an optimal solution of problem (34) such that {a mathematical formula}vA ≤ max ⁡ {lA,u} for all {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I(Dji).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Let {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I(Dji).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Assume first that there exists no set {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ A(x,y) such that {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊂ A.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In that case, Equations (18), (19), (20), (21), (22) do not include any constraint of type {a mathematical formula}vA ′ ≤ vA.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Therefore, since the objective function increases as variable {a mathematical formula}vA decreases, we know that there exists an optimal solution such that {a mathematical formula}vA=lA ≤ max ⁡ {lA,uA}.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Assume now that there exists {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ A(x,y) such that {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊂ A.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">First, we want to prove that imposing {a mathematical formula}vA ≤ max ⁡ {lA,u} does not impact on variable {a mathematical formula}vA ′ .</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Two cases may occur: either {a mathematical formula} Ω A ′ >0 or {a mathematical formula} Ω A ′ <0.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Let {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ A(x,y) be such that {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊂ A and {a mathematical formula} Ω A ′ >0 (it exists).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Note that {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊂ Dji must hold, as otherwise we would have {a mathematical formula}Dji ⊂ A and {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I(Dji) (which yields a contradiction).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">As a consequence, we necessarily have {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ P(Dji); hence, {a mathematical formula}vA ′ is bounded above by u.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Therefore, imposing {a mathematical formula}vA ≤ max ⁡ {lA,u} does not impact on variable {a mathematical formula}vA ′ .</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Let {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ A(x,y) be such that {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊂ A and {a mathematical formula} Ω A ′ <0 (it exists).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">If {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ P(Dji), then {a mathematical formula}vA ′ is bounded above by u and so imposing {a mathematical formula}vA ≤ max ⁡ {u,lA} does not impact on variable {a mathematical formula}vA ′ .</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Otherwise, we necessarily have {a mathematical formula}A ′ ∈ I(Dji) and so the result can be obtained by iterating this complete reasoning on {a mathematical formula}A ′ : {a mathematical formula}vA ′ ≤ max ⁡ {lA ′ ,u} ≤ max ⁡ {lA,u}.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Hence, we can impose {a mathematical formula}vA ≤ max ⁡ {u,lA} without impacting on variable {a mathematical formula}vA ′ .</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">As a consequence, since the objective function increases as variable {a mathematical formula}vA decreases, we know that there exists an optimal solution such that {a mathematical formula}vA ≤ max ⁡ {lA,u}.We can observe that</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">{a mathematical formula}h(u,P(Dji),I(Dji)) is an increasing function of u since constraints of types “ {a mathematical formula}vA ≤ u ” or “ {a mathematical formula}vA ≤ max ⁡ {lA,u} ” become less constraining as u increases.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}h(u,P(Dji),I(Dji)) is maximized for {a mathematical formula}u=uji.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">As a consequence, in order to prove that {a mathematical formula}f(u,A(x,y)) is maximized for {a mathematical formula}u=uji, it is sufficient to show that {a mathematical formula}g(u,S(Dji)) is maximized for {a mathematical formula}u=uji.First, let us simplify the optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Moreover, by definition of set {a mathematical formula}s(Dji)m − , we have:{a mathematical formula} Therefore, due to the monotonicity constraints, {a mathematical formula}vA=max ⁡ {lA,vDmi} must hold at the optimum point.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Then, since {a mathematical formula}vDmi ≥ u (by definition of {a mathematical formula}S(Dji)) and {a mathematical formula}u ≥ lA (by hypothesis), we can conclude {a mathematical formula}vA=vDmi at the optimum point.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">As a consequence, variables {a mathematical formula}vA,A ∈ s(Dji)m − , can be substituted by {a mathematical formula}vDmi in the optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">More precisely, {a mathematical formula}g(u,s(Dji)) can be computed by solving the following problem:{a mathematical formula} Note that this optimization problem only involves the positive variables {a mathematical formula}vDmi,m ∈ {1, … ,j}.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Moreover, since {a mathematical formula}vD1i must be larger than or equal to {a mathematical formula}vD2i due to Equation (19), then we know that there exists an optimal solution such that {a mathematical formula}vD1i=max ⁡ {lD1i,vD2i}; then, since {a mathematical formula}vD2i ≥ u (by definition of g) and {a mathematical formula}u ≥ lD1i (by hypothesis), we can conclude {a mathematical formula}vD1i=vD2i.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Therefore, we can substitute {a mathematical formula}vD1i by {a mathematical formula}vD2i in the problem, which leads to the following objective function:{a mathematical formula} By iterating this reasoning, we can conclude that:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Α = ∑ A ∈ s(Dji) Ω A.</a>
