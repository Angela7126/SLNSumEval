<a href="#0" id="0">A Bayesian or probabilistic network {a mathematical formula}B is a graphical structure that models a set of stochastic variables, the conditional independences among these variables, and a joint probability distribution over these variables [52].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Instance: A Bayesian network {a mathematical formula}B=(GB,Pr), where V is partitioned into evidence variables E with joint value assignment e, explanation variables H, and intermediate variables I.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The actual value of ACO2 does not influence the most probable value of the observable variables in the network, i.e., {a mathematical formula}argmaxhPr(h,e,i,ACO2=high)=argmaxhPr(h,e,i,ACO2=mid)=argmaxhPr(h,e,i,ACO2=low) for every joint value assignment i to the intermediate variables other than ACO2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Instance: A Bayesian network {a mathematical formula}B, partitioned into a set of observed evidence variables E, a set of explanation variables H, a set of ‘ relevant ’ intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I+ that are marginalized over, and a set of ‘ irrelevant ’ intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I − that are not marginalized over.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Output: The joint value assignment to the variables in the explanation set that is most probable for the maximum number of joint value assignments to the irrelevant intermediate variables.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this case, every joint value assignment to any subset of the intermediate variables gives the MAP explanation as most frugal explanation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, in our model we again partition the intermediate variables I and perform full inference only on the relevant intermediate variables {a mathematical formula}I+.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let {a mathematical formula}B=(GB,Pr) be a Bayesian network partitioned into evidence nodes E with joint value assignment e, intermediate nodes I, and an explanation set H. Let {a mathematical formula}I ∈ I, and let {a mathematical formula} Ω (I ∖ {I}) denote the set of joint value assignments to the intermediate variables other than I.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Instance: A Bayesian network {a mathematical formula}B=(GB,Pr), where V is partitioned into evidence variables E with joint value assignment e, explanation variables H, and intermediate variables I, and a designated variable {a mathematical formula}I ∈ I.</a>
