<a href="#0" id="0">This was also suggested by Makinson and Gärdenfors [19], according to whom “ q follows non-monotonically from p ” means that q holds if an “ arbitrary but fixed background theory ” (p. 189) is revised by p. Denoting that theory by K, belief revision by ⁎ , and non-monotonic consequence by {a mathematical formula}| ∼ we obtain:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, an operation {a mathematical formula}| ∼ based on the co-occurrence test will not in general do so.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Even if {a mathematical formula}K ⁎ p=K and {a mathematical formula}q ∈ K there may be other reasonably plausible p-containing belief sets that do not contain q, and then {a mathematical formula}p| ∼ q will not hold.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A centrolinear model is a pair {a mathematical formula} 〈 X, ≦ 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}X is a set of logically closed sets (belief sets) in the object language ({a mathematical formula}L), and ≦ (with the strict part <) is an ordering on {a mathematical formula}X, such that for any sentence p, there is a unique ≦ -minimal element of {a mathematical formula}X that contains p.{sup:3}A centrolinear model is exhaustive if and only if {a mathematical formula} ⋃ X=L.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In other words, if ⁎ is a transitively relational partial meet revision on the belief set K, then there is a centrolinear model {a mathematical formula} 〈 X, ≦ 〉 such that K is the ≦ -minimal element of {a mathematical formula}X and that ⁎ coincides with the belief revision derived from {a mathematical formula} 〈 X, ≦ 〉 according to the simple principle just referred to [14].</a>
