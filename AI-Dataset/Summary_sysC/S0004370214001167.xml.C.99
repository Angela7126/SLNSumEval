<a href="#0" id="0">If ⊗ is continuous, then this equivalence determines the unique residuum{a mathematical formula} The residuum behaves like classical implication on the truth values 0 and 1 and is used to generalize the implication to fuzzy logics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We now describe how the property {a mathematical formula}P △ can be used to prove undecidability of {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -L. Recall that the idea is to add a set {a mathematical formula}OV ≠ W of axioms (as in (5)) to {a mathematical formula}OP so that every model {a mathematical formula}I is restricted to satisfy {a mathematical formula}VI(g( Ν )) ≁ WI(g( Ν )) for every {a mathematical formula} Ν ∈ N ⁎ , thus obtaining an ontology that is consistent if and only if {a mathematical formula}P has no solution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is important to keep in mind for the subsequent sections that this constitutes an additional condition that has to be verified before we can show undecidability of a given fuzzy DL {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -L. We also assume that {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -L satisfies {a mathematical formula}P △ , and for a given model {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}OP, g denotes the function mapping the nodes of {a mathematical formula}IP to elements of {a mathematical formula} Δ I given by the property.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We assume in the following that ⊗ is not the Gödel t-norm.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The reason for this is that our encoding function and the subsequent constructions depend on the choice of one component {a mathematical formula}((a,b), ⊗ ′ ) of ⊗ where {a mathematical formula} ⊗ ′ is either Ł or {an inline-figure}.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If ⊗ is different from the Gödel t-norm, such a component must exist by Theorem 2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For every continuous t-norm ⊗ except the Gödel t-norm, the logics{a mathematical formula} ⊗ -AL,{a mathematical formula} ⊗ -ELC, and{a mathematical formula} Ł (0,b)-NELsatisfy{a mathematical formula}P ⇝ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Together with Theorem 12, the previous lemmata show that the logics {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -AL=, {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -ELC ≥ , and {a mathematical formula} Ł (0,b)-NEL have the canonical model property.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We will see that the last two logics also satisfy the solution property, while for {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -AL= we additionally need the implication constructor.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The function g for a model {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}OP can be constructed as in the proof of Theorem 12, with the exception that we define as {a mathematical formula}g( Ν i) that element {a mathematical formula}y ∈ Δ I whose existence is guaranteed by {a mathematical formula}OP, ⇝ → when we consider {a mathematical formula}x=g( Ν ).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For every continuous t-norm except the Gödel t-norm, the logic{a mathematical formula} ⊗ -IELsatisfies{a mathematical formula}P ⇝ → .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Together with Theorem 24, this implies that {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -IEL= satisfies the canonical model property whenever ⊗ is not the Gödel t-norm.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In the next section, we use this result to show that ontology consistency in sublogics of {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -SROIQf, ≥ + can be decided using classical reasoning algorithms.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For a given ontology {a mathematical formula}O in {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -SROIQf, ≥ +, we define {a mathematical formula}crisp(O) to be the classical {a mathematical formula}SROIQ+-ontology that is obtained from {a mathematical formula}O by replacing all the non-zero truth values appearing in the axioms by 1.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The undecidability results for consistency of classical ontologies (the first row of Table 5) immediately carry over to this problem since the reduction uses only one individual name and consistency of a finite set {a mathematical formula}O of GCIs together with the crisp assertions {a mathematical formula} 〈 e0:C1 〉 , … , {a mathematical formula} 〈 e0:Cn 〉 is equivalent to the 1-satisfiability of the concept {a mathematical formula}C1 ⊓ ⋯ ⊓ Cn w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The idea to reduce consistency to consistency in classical DLs has been used for arbitrary finite chains of truth values with combination functions similar to ordinal sums of the Gödel and Ł ukasiewicz t-norms, and even for very expressive DLs such as {a mathematical formula}SROIQ[33], [34]; however, the reduction often increases the size of the input ontology by an exponential factor.</a>
