<a href="#0" id="0">Thus, we define here an alternative notion that is called the generating structure of {a mathematical formula}K. This structure is always finite and can be used for deciding various reasoning tasks efficiently.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Formally, given a simple KB {a mathematical formula}K= 〈 O,A 〉 , the generating structure{a mathematical formula}gen(K)= 〈 Δ gen(K), ⋅ gen(K) 〉 of {a mathematical formula}K, is defined as:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}a ∈ ind(A), A is a concept name, and P is a role name occurring in {a mathematical formula}K. It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}gen(K) is of polynomial size in the size of {a mathematical formula}K. Note that the canonical model {a mathematical formula}uni(K) can be obtained by unraveling [56, Ch.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From the previous examples, we conclude that: There exists a mapping{a mathematical formula}M=( Σ , Γ ,B)and a KB{a mathematical formula}Ks= 〈 S,As 〉 over Σ such that there is no universal solution for{a mathematical formula}Ksunder{a mathematical formula}M(even if extended ABoxes are allowed).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As pointed out in the previous examples, a natural way to construct a universal solution for {a mathematical formula}Ks under {a mathematical formula}M is to populate the target with all the facts implied by {a mathematical formula}uni(S ∪ B,As).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From the previous examples, we conclude that: There exists a mapping{a mathematical formula}M=( Σ , Γ ,B)and a KB{a mathematical formula}Ks= 〈 S,As 〉 over Σ such that, there is no universal solution for{a mathematical formula}Ksunder{a mathematical formula}M, but there exists a universal{a mathematical formula}UCQ-solution for{a mathematical formula}Ksunder{a mathematical formula}M.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The lower bound can be shown (see the appendix) similarly to Theorem 11 in [55] by reduction from the validity problem for quantified Boolean formulas, known to be PSpace-complete: The non-emptiness problem for universal solutions with extended ABoxes in DL-Lite{a mathematical formula}RisPSpace-hard.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It follows that {a mathematical formula}S ∪ B ⊨ A ⊑ B ′ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A first and obvious requirement for a {a mathematical formula}UCQ-representation {a mathematical formula}T is that {a mathematical formula}T should entail an axiom of the form {a mathematical formula}D ′ ⊑ B ′ so that {a mathematical formula}T ∪ B ⊨ A ⊑ B ′ (hence, {a mathematical formula}B ⊨ A ⊑ D ′ ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">On the other hand, it could be that {a mathematical formula}B ⊨ D ⊑ D ′ for some D distinct from A, in which case it follows also {a mathematical formula}T ∪ B ⊨ D ⊑ B ′ .</a>
