<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}A be the set of all answer sets of {a mathematical formula} Π Φ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Φ if {a mathematical formula} Π Φ is consistent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now that all epistemic negations have been removed from a logic program Π , leading to an epistemic reduct {a mathematical formula} Π Φ w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">a guess Φ , we can apply any answer set semantics for logic programs without epistemic negation to compute all answer sets {a mathematical formula}A of {a mathematical formula} Π Φ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The collection {a mathematical formula}A of all answer sets of {a mathematical formula} Π Φ under {a mathematical formula}X is a candidate world view of Π w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We say F is true in Π under the general epistemic semantics if Π has a world view {a mathematical formula}A such that F is true in every answer set in {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since {a mathematical formula} Φ 1 is the largest guess, {a mathematical formula}A is a world view of {a mathematical formula} Π 1 w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The program Π contains {a mathematical formula} Π 1 and {a mathematical formula} Π 2 ′ and has a candidate world view w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As I is an FLP answer set of the epistemic reduct {a mathematical formula} Π Φ , it is a model of {a mathematical formula} Π Φ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">(1) Let {a mathematical formula}A be a world view of Π w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then {a mathematical formula}A is also the set of all FLP answer sets of the epistemic reduct {a mathematical formula} Π Φ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Let r be a rule in {a mathematical formula} Π Φ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Furthermore, A must be true in every FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π Φ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Φ , then it is easy to see that {a mathematical formula} Π 0 has a candidate world view w.r.t.</a>
