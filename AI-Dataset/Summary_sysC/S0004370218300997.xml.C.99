<a href="#0" id="0">The algorithm then finds the optimal coalition structure, denoted {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ , in the temporary graph (line 2), which is possible to do in polynomial time according to Corollary 2.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The algorithm concludes that the optimal edges to add to G are all the edges that are within a coalition in {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ (line 3), and the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare in G after adding the edges in {a mathematical formula}E+ is {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to prove the correctness, we first show that {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare in G, after adding the edges in {a mathematical formula}E+.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Indeed, given a coalition structure P in {a mathematical formula}G ′ , every edge from {a mathematical formula}E+ ′ within a coalition {a mathematical formula}C ∈ P contributes {a mathematical formula}2 − Α to the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">All agents in the subset must strictly benefit from the deviation, as well as the agents in the coalition that the subset joins.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, in step (6) we initially check a deviation to coalition {a mathematical formula}Ci of all the agents (except the k chosen agents, to ensure k coalitions).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since all weights are non-negative, the utility function of an agent is monotonic in the sense that if an agent does not benefit from a certain coalition, it will not benefit from any of its sub-coalitions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, if there are some agents in the subset which do not benefit from the current deviation they cannot be a part of the deviating agents (since all other possible blocking coalitions deviating to {a mathematical formula}Ci are sub-coalitions of the current one), therefore we continue to check only the agents that did strictly benefit and that are potentially a part of a blocking coalition.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If some agents in {a mathematical formula}Ci do not benefit from the deviation, it means that {a mathematical formula}Ci cannot be a part of the blocking coalition, and we need to consider the next possible coalition to deviate to: {a mathematical formula}Ci+1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If all of the agents in the deviation and in coalition {a mathematical formula}Ci strictly benefit from the deviation, then we found a blocking coalition, and therefore P is not a member of the k-coalitions-core.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, the algorithm enumerates all possible potentially blocking coalitions for P. If the algorithm did not discover such deviation, then P is guaranteed to be in the k-coalitions-core.As for the complexity, it is clear that step (1) can be performed in polynomial time.</a>
