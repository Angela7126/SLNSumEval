<a href="#6" id="6">The operator “ ⊕ ” , or CR-expansion, is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since {a mathematical formula}C − (D,E) follows from withdrawing some credibility objects from {a mathematical formula}C without adding anything, it is natural to think that {a mathematical formula}C − (D,E) does not contain elements that do not belong to {a mathematical formula}C.</a>

<a href="#16" id="16">We will use “ ⁎ ” to denote a general prioritized revision operator, and we will propose the following postulates for prioritized revision.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Since the revision operator defined here is considered prioritized (the new information has priority), the first postulate establishes that the revision should be successful.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">That is, the result of revising a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C by a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[T,D] should be a new credibility base that contains {a mathematical formula}[T,D].</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">This postulate establishes that {a mathematical formula}C ⁎ [T,D] preserves from {a mathematical formula}C the same credibility objects as {a mathematical formula}C ⁎ [T,E].</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Next, we will give a construction of the prioritized revision operator for credibility bases, called C-revision using reliability (or CR-revision for short), denoted “ {a mathematical formula} ⊛ Σ ↓ ” .</a>

<a href="#32" id="32">Given a tuple T and two informant agents D and E, if {a mathematical formula}[T,D] is accepted in the revised base whenever {a mathematical formula}[T,E] is accepted in the revised base, then {a mathematical formula}C ⊚ ⊚ [T,D] and {a mathematical formula}C ⊚ ⊚ [T,E] preserve the same credibility objects.</a>
