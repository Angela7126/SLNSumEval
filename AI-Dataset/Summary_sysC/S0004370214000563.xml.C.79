<a href="#0" id="0">By using an LP-approach to find independent intervals for schedules in {a mathematical formula}S ′ , we obtain the flexibility of the original system S. We show that in case of STNs this flexibility metric can be computed in polynomial time and offers the possibility to adapt existing schedules in {a mathematical formula}O(1) time.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, for each individual t, {a mathematical formula}flexN(t) gives an exact measure of the flexibility in scheduling event t, since by decomposability (Proposition 1), for every choice of a value {a mathematical formula}v ∈ [est(t),lst(t)] there exists a schedule Σ for S such that {a mathematical formula} Σ (t)=v.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence,{a mathematical formula} So, according to the measure {a mathematical formula}flexN, {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 have the same flexibility, which, of course, is counterintuitive: For each event {a mathematical formula}ti in {a mathematical formula}S1 we can determine its starting time between 0 and 5 independently from the other events.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">So, the total flexibility, expressed as the amount of choice we have in selecting a starting time for an event, equals {a mathematical formula}5×3=15, which corresponds to the value as specified by {a mathematical formula}flexN(S1).The choice for the starting time of an event {a mathematical formula}ti in {a mathematical formula}S2, however, may influence the choice of the starting time of the next event {a mathematical formula}ti+1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Generalizing {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 to systems containing k concurrent and k sequential events, respectively, we see that the freedom to schedule in {a mathematical formula}S1 equals {a mathematical formula}flex(S1)=5×k, while the flexibility of {a mathematical formula}S2 is independent of k and remains {a mathematical formula}flex(S2)=5.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hunsberger defined his flexibility metric, which we will denote by {a mathematical formula}flexH(S), by taking into account not only the apparent flexibility {a mathematical formula}lst(t) − est(t) of every event t, but also the flexibility between pairs of events {a mathematical formula}ti and {a mathematical formula}tj.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, generalizing {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 to systems containing k concurrent and k sequential events, respectively, we observe that{a mathematical formula} while{a mathematical formula} This means that for larger values of k, the ratio between {a mathematical formula}flexH(S1) and {a mathematical formula}flexH(S2) will converge to 2:{a mathematical formula} The ratio of the real flexibilities of {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 (see Eqs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First of all, we observe that this metric is defined as the sum of intervals, each interval {a mathematical formula}[at,bt] indicating the flexibility of a single event t. Here, flexibility means freedom to choose a real starting time for the event.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the introduction we already observed that instead of computing a fixed schedule Σ for an STN S, we would like to compute an interval schedule for S, such that in every interval for an event {a mathematical formula}ti we could freely choose a value {a mathematical formula}vi to compose a schedule {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ for S. First, let us make this notion of an interval schedule more precise:</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To solve the first problem (computing an interval schedule) we use a transformation from a given STN to another STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ and we show that any schedule obtained for the latter can be used to obtain an interval schedule for the former.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To solve the second problem, we use a Linear Programming approach, realizing that an STN such as {a mathematical formula}S ′ can be represented as a set of linear equations and the objective function is a linear function maximizing the size of the intervals of an interval schedule for the original STN S.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The significance of this result is that now we know which constraints we have to put on the endpoints of the intervals in an interval schedule {a mathematical formula}IS.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Take an arbitrary schedule Σ for S and construct an assignment {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ for {a mathematical formula}S ′ as follows: for every {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T, let {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ (t+)= Σ (t − )= Σ (t).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">It is obvious that {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ will satisfy all constraints in {a mathematical formula}C ′ , hence {a mathematical formula}S ′ is consistent.Therefore, we can assume some arbitrary schedule {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ for {a mathematical formula}S ′ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We show that {a mathematical formula}{[ Σ ′ (t − ), Σ ′ (t+)]|t ∈ T} is an interval schedule for S. Take some arbitrary constraint {a mathematical formula}tj − ti ≤ cij in C. By Proposition 5, it is sufficient to show that {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ (tj+) − Σ ′ (ti − ) ≤ cij.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">But this is immediate as by construction of {a mathematical formula}C ′ , {a mathematical formula}tj+ − ti − ≤ cij is a constraints in C and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ is a schedule for {a mathematical formula}S ′ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The transformation of an STN S into a double STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ can be used to obtain an interval schedule for S. An arbitrary interval schedule, however, does not suffice to determine the flexibility of an STN, since the sum of the sizes of the intervals obtained does not need to be maximal and therefore does not satisfy F3.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Hence, to obtain the flexibility of an STN, we have to select those solutions Σ for the double STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ that maximize the sum of the sizes of the intervals.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Note that if {a mathematical formula}Tu= ∅ this problem is exactly the problem of finding a maximum interval schedule for an STN to obtain {a mathematical formula}flex(S), as we discussed in the previous section.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">If the flexibility interval of {a mathematical formula}ti is set to {a mathematical formula}[ti − ,ti+] then according to the interpretation of this constraint, the (required) flexibility of {a mathematical formula}tj should be equal to {a mathematical formula}[ti − +lj,ti++uj].</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">First of all, we should restrict the objective function to the sum of the differences {a mathematical formula}(t+ − t − ) for the controllable events {a mathematical formula}t ∈ Tc only and</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">This problem can be simply solved by minimizing the total sum of differences between the lower and upper bounds obtained and the lower and upper bounds required for the uncontrollable events as can be seen in the following linear program:{a mathematical formula}</a>
