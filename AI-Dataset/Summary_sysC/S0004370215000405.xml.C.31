<a href="#0" id="0">Definition 4 captures the weak controllability concept by requiring the existence of a schedule for each situation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This definition implicitly models a strategy as a function {a mathematical formula}f: Ω P → R|Xc| that maps each situation Ω in a schedule for the controllable time points that fulfills the constraints of the projection {a mathematical formula}P Ω .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If such a function exists, the problem is weakly controllable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From here on, we assume an encoded problem {a mathematical formula}(X → c,Y → u, Γ (Y → u), Ψ (X → c,Y → u)) is given.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Intuitively, a temporal problem is weakly controllable if there exists a strategy that maps every situation to a corresponding assignment to controllable time points, in such a way that all free constraints are satisfied.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We can rephrase the concept of weak controllability presented in Definition 4 as a satisfiability problem modulo the {a mathematical formula}LRA theory as follows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If we interpret the vector of time points {a mathematical formula}X → c and the vector of durations {a mathematical formula}Y → u as vectors of real variables, and the set of constraints {a mathematical formula} Γ (Y → u) and {a mathematical formula} Ψ (X → c,Y → u) as formulae in {a mathematical formula}QF_LRA, Eq.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">From here on, we assume the encoding {a mathematical formula}(X → c,Y → u, Γ (Y → u), Ψ (X → c,Y → u)) of a TPU is given.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In general, a weak strategy is a function that maps each assignment to uncontrollable durations satisfying {a mathematical formula} Γ (Y → u) (i.e.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">each situation) into an assignment to the controllable time points, such that all the free constraints are satisfied.</a>
