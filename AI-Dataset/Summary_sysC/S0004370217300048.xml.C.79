<a href="#0" id="0">We will first define the expected utility of the players from the CS player attempting to reach the goal {a mathematical formula}Gi by following the possible path P, given that the probability of getting to the goal is pr.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The expected utility to {a mathematical formula}SPi is defined as:{a mathematical formula} For the {a mathematical formula}SPj agent ({a mathematical formula}j ≠ i) the expected utility is defined as follows, because the CS player will not reach its goal.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula} The expected utility of the CS player is:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We define the social welfare of an offer O at state s between a CS player and an {a mathematical formula}SPi player to be{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The CS preferred offer to the {a mathematical formula}SPg requests all of the chips (i.e., one gray and 10 red chips) from the {a mathematical formula}SPg player.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Similarly, the CS preferred offer to the {a mathematical formula}SPy requests all of the chips from the {a mathematical formula}SPy player.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Ties are broken towards the {a mathematical formula}SPg player, since the sum of the utilities for the CS preferred offer to both {a mathematical formula}SPg and {a mathematical formula}SPy players is equal (Equation (8)).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The {a mathematical formula}SPg will accept the offer and the CS player will move one square to the gray goal, thereby ending the game.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If it is the negotiation stage of an odd round and it has received offers{a mathematical formula}O2and{a mathematical formula}O1and let{a mathematical formula}Oldenote the best offer for the CS player (breaking ties first towards the offer that maximizes the social welfare (Equation(8)) and then towards the offer that is made by{a mathematical formula}SPgplayer):{a mathematical formula}The CS player will accept{a mathematical formula}Olonly if{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Correctness of expected utility definitionsLet O be an offer that is accepted at state s,{a mathematical formula}Ps ⁎ is a preferred path that is followed by the CS player starting at state s and that both CS and SP players follow the equilibrium strategies defined inTheorem 1.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Strategy for the CS player to make an offer: Suppose that the CS's player offer {a mathematical formula}O ˆ s is toward {a mathematical formula}SPi.</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">If CS player will make an offer that will not be accepted by the {a mathematical formula}SPi then its expected utility will be {a mathematical formula}Eui(s,Ps ⁎ ) and again by the definitions {a mathematical formula}Eucs(s,O ˆ s) ≥ Eucs(s,Ps ⁎ ).</a>
