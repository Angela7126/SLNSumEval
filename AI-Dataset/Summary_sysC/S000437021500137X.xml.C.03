<a href="#0" id="0">Item {a mathematical formula}v3 is in a set that includes the second-most sparse items.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This paper deals with the relationships formed by user {a mathematical formula}um, item {a mathematical formula}vn, and tag {a mathematical formula}tk.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}v1 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">SSTF applies biases from semantic classes to item (or tag) feature vectors in tensor factorization to solve the sparsity problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">SSTF creates an augmented tensor by incorporating the relationships composed of {a mathematical formula}u1 (or {a mathematical formula}u2), CV1 (or CV2), and “ Breathless ” into the original tensor.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">SSTF incorporates semantic biases into the tensor factorization by updating the feature vectors for objects using those for classes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">2-(i), SSTF lifts items in the most sparse item set {a mathematical formula}Vs(1) to their classes (the size is {a mathematical formula}Sv(1)) and creates an augmented tensor {a mathematical formula}Rv(1) from the original tensor {a mathematical formula}R. It also lifts items in the second-most sparse item set {a mathematical formula}Vs(2) to their classes (the size is {a mathematical formula}Sv(2)) and creates an augmented tensor {a mathematical formula}Rv(2) from {a mathematical formula}R.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">SSTF constructs the i-th augmented tensor {a mathematical formula}Rt(i) in the same way as it creates {a mathematical formula}Rv(i):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">SSTF incorporates semantic biases into tensor factorization in the BPTF framework.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">SSTF uses the same precision Α , feature vectors {a mathematical formula}um, {a mathematical formula}vn, and {a mathematical formula}tk, and their hyper-parameters when factorizing the original tensor and augmented tensors.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}tk is updated in a similar way by incorporating semantic biases into the feature vectors of the sparse tags.In Fig.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Thus, {a mathematical formula} Ε (1) and {a mathematical formula} Ε (2) are set to zero.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The size of the user – item – tag tensor is {a mathematical formula}2026×5088×9160.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The size of the user – item – tag tensor was {a mathematical formula}36,472×4503×4990.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The size of the user – item – tag tensor was {a mathematical formula}1824×6854×8922.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">(2) and {a mathematical formula} Ε (i) in Eq.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This indicates that performance can be improved by setting {a mathematical formula} Ε (i) for item classes and {a mathematical formula} Ε (i) for tag classes independently.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The conditional distribution of {a mathematical formula}cv(i) can be factorized into individual items and individual augmented item classes.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">This means SSTF shares those parameters in the factorization of tensors {a mathematical formula}R and {a mathematical formula}Rv(i).</a>
