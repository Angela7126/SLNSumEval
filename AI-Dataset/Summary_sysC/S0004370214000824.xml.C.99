<a href="#0" id="0">Then, {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ B follows via the last axiom of {a mathematical formula}Tn.Toward the claimed triple-exponential lower bound, we now show that every uniform interpolant of {a mathematical formula}Tn for {a mathematical formula} Σ ={A1,A2,B,r,s} must contain for each {a mathematical formula}C ∈ C2n − 1 a GCI of the form {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ B ′ with {a mathematical formula}B ′ =B or {a mathematical formula}B ′ =B ⊓ F for some F (where we consider structural variants – i.e., concepts whose characteristic interpretations are isomorphic – as syntactically equal).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Toward a contradiction, we assume that this is not the case, i.e., there is a uniform interpolant {a mathematical formula}T ′ and a {a mathematical formula}C ∈ C2n − 1 where {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ B ′ ∉ T ′ for any {a mathematical formula}B ′ containing B as a (top-level) conjunct.Yet, {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ B must be a consequence of {a mathematical formula}T ′ , since it is a consequence of {a mathematical formula}Tn containing only signature elements from Σ and {a mathematical formula}T ′ is a uniform interpolant of {a mathematical formula}Tn w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In essence, the lemma below implies that, in case of flattened terminologies explicitly containing all elements of Pre, we can derive all subsumees of a concept by (1) applying the rule {a mathematical formula}(Ex) to construct existential restrictions from two concepts in a subsumption relation and/or (2) replacing concepts occurring within subsumees by their subsumees.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a regular tree grammar {a mathematical formula}G=(S,N,F,R), the derivation relation {a mathematical formula} → G associated to G is a relation on terms from {a mathematical formula}T(F ∪ N) such that {a mathematical formula}s → Gt if and only if there is a rule {a mathematical formula}N → Α ∈ R and there is a context C such that {a mathematical formula}s=C[N/X] and {a mathematical formula}t=C[ Α /X], where X is a variable from {a mathematical formula}X.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Theorem 3 ensures that the subsumees and subsumers used within Definition 8 are all entailed by {a mathematical formula}T. Theorem 3 and Definition 8 imply that {a mathematical formula}T Σ does not contain any concept and role symbols not from Σ .For the second direction, assume that there exists a uniform {a mathematical formula}EL Σ -interpolant of {a mathematical formula}Tnf and, subsequently, {a mathematical formula}T. Then, by Lemma 4, there exists a uniform {a mathematical formula}EL Σ -interpolant {a mathematical formula}T ′ of {a mathematical formula}Tnf and {a mathematical formula}T with {a mathematical formula}d(T ′ ) ≤ N.</a>
