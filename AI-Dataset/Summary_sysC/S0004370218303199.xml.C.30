<a href="#0" id="0">We propose an optimal Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation of the problem of scheduling EVs in a MoD scheme that maximizes the number of completed tasks (i.e., trip requests from consumers) or the EV utilization (i.e., number of time points each EV is travelling), either using battery swap or battery charging at each station.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, this algorithm is used as a pre-processing step in order to determine the tasks to be executed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, any of the scheduling algorithms described in the following section has to be used in order to calculate the task execution schedule for each EV.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The intuition behind this algorithm is the following: Given that the dimension of the problem that affects the execution time the most is the number of EVs (see Section 7.1), we solve the MIP problem for each EV separately.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, the MIP formulation is solved sequentially (see Algorithm 1), for each EV within the list of available EVs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In more detail, after the set containing all completed tasks is initialized to the empty one (line 1), the optimal algorithm is called for each EV{sup:12} (lines 2 – 9): Every time the schedule for one EV is calculated (line 6), the sets for the completed tasks and the remaining tasks are updated accordingly (lines 7, 8).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">At the end of this procedure, the set that contains the completed tasks is returned (line 10).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note that this algorithm works both with battery swap and battery charge.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We will refer to the one with battery swap as Off-Incr-Swap and to the one with battery charge as Off-Incr-Charge.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The incremental MIP algorithm achieves near optimal solutions with relatively small execution time (see Section 7.1).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, for problems with more than a few thousands EVs and tasks, the execution time increases.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The execution of Algorithm 4 generates a schedule for all EVs as well as for the total number of completed tasks.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In case where after the max flow algorithm (Section 4), the Greedy algorithm gets as input a set of tasks that all of them can be executed, the problem of scheduling EVs to tasks becomes a simple resource allocation problem.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In this case, the heuristic function is not used as enough EVs to execute all tasks always exist (i.e., lines 9 – 21 of Algorithm 4 are never executed).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Thus, at every time point EVs are simply assigned to the tasks.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Given the performance of all algorithms, we argue that when battery swap is used, the Off-Greedy-Swap in combination with the MaxFlow is the appropriate solution for all problem sizes as it provides the optimal solution with very low execution time.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Whereas, when battery charge is used, the combination of the Off-Greedy-Charge with the MaxFlow and the use of local search afterwords leads to the best solution especially for large problems.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Also note that the incremental-MIP algorithm is not used in combination with the local search because the execution time increases 10-times on average, and the solution quality improves by less than 0.3% on average.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Given the execution time of the incremental and the greedy algorithms combined with local search, we argue that for a setting where the EVs carry different battery types, and when the number of tasks is larger than 1000, the incremental-MIP is the appropriate solution.</a>
