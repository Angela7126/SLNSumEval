<a href="#0" id="0">Speculative knowledge is defined in terms of awareness bisimulation: agent i knows speculatively Φ at {a mathematical formula}(M,s) iff Φ is true in every epistemic awareness state that is {a mathematical formula}Ai(s) awareness bisimilar to some state t accessible from s in M. Note that the interpretation of speculative knowledge depends on the class of models we consider: for the class {a mathematical formula}S5AI, {a mathematical formula}KiS Φ means that Φ is true in every{a mathematical formula}S5AIepistemic awareness state that is {a mathematical formula}Ai(s) awareness bisimilar to some state accessible from the actual state.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">But these epistemic awareness states are p awareness bisimilar and therefore modally equivalent in the language {a mathematical formula}L(KE,A).To prove that {a mathematical formula}LE ∼ S5AILS, first note that Lemma 41 establishing {a mathematical formula}LE ⪯ LS does not depend on frame properties of epistemic awareness models and therefore also applies under the restriction to class {a mathematical formula}S5AI.</a>
