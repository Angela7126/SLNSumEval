<a href="#0" id="0">Creation of the initial page taxonomy: we first create a taxonomy for the Wikipedia pages by i) parsing the textual definitions of each page and extracting the hypernym lemma(s) and ii) by disambiguating each hypernym lemma according to the Wikipedia sense inventory.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let P be the set of all Wikipedia pages and let {a mathematical formula}TP=(P,E) be the directed graph of the page taxonomy whose nodes are pages and whose edge set E is initially empty ({a mathematical formula}E:= ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that we do not constrain {a mathematical formula}ph to be necessarily a sense of h and let it represent an arbitrary Wikipedia page; for instance, we allow the hypernym lemma person to be linked to the Wikipedia page Individual which is not a sense of person in Wikipedia.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, consider the Wikipedia page Aristotle and its hypernym lemma teacher.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, given the set {a mathematical formula}W ⊂ P of Wikipedia pages which have at least one category in common with p and share the hypernym lemma with it, we select the most frequent hypernym across these.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For example, the Category linker disambiguated the hypernym lemma linguist of the Wikipedia page Noam Chomsky with Linguistics.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">More formally, the TT in language L contains translation information for each English lemma l such that i) Wikipedia contains a linked occurrence of l (to a page p) and ii) p has an equivalent page {a mathematical formula}p ′ in language {a mathematical formula}L ′ and {a mathematical formula}p ′ is linked by some foreign term {a mathematical formula}l ′ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Pages which do have a corresponding page in English and whose hypernyms all coincide with those found in English (i.e., have the same hypernym aligned across languages).</a>
