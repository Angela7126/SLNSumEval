<a href="#0" id="0">Our improved algorithm consists of two steps: (i) first we construct a special type of a belief-observation POMDP; and we show that there exists a finite-memory almost-sure winning strategy for the objective {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 iff there exists a randomized memoryless almost-sure winning strategy in the belief-observation POMDP for the {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 objective; and (ii) then we show how to determine whether there exists a randomized memoryless almost-sure winning strategy in the belief-observation POMDP for the {a mathematical formula}LimAvg=1 objective in polynomial time with respect to the size of the belief-observation POMDP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The expected average {a mathematical formula}E(Xi) is at most {a mathematical formula}12 for all i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore the expected {a mathematical formula}LimAvg of the sequence {a mathematical formula}w ˆ is at most:{a mathematical formula}Since {a mathematical formula}Xi's are non-negative measurable functions, by Fatou's lemma [15, Theorem 3.5, page 16] that shows the integral of limit inferior of a sequence of non-negative measurable functions is at most the limit inferior of the integrals of these functions, we have the following inequality:{a mathematical formula}Note that since the strategy Σ is almost-sure winning for the objective {a mathematical formula}LimAvg>12, then the expected value of rewards must be strictly greater than {a mathematical formula}12.</a>
