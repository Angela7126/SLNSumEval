<a href="#0" id="0">In this section, we first experimentally validate the semi-supervised aggregation on synthetic data, and then apply the method to AOD estimation using real-world aerosol data set.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) measure to report performance of various aggregation methods, commonly used in AOD research [34].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">RMSE is defined as follows,{a mathematical formula} where the sum is over N labeled data points from the test set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is important to note that baseline linear regression alone, trained on labeled data points only, would have RMSE of around 1, much worse than any of the experts.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Interestingly, for purely unlabeled data set, the method with informative prior obtained slightly worse result than the method without, which is due to overfitting to the estimated ground-truth values for unlabeled data points (i.e., the prior model learns to predict other experts' predictions), and can be mitigated with stronger regularization when number of labeled data points is small or by increasing size of the training set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, for both {a mathematical formula}R=1 and {a mathematical formula}R=2, the method with context-dependent prior outperformed the aggregation method with uninformative prior even for small number of available ground-truth labels.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, the performance gap quickly grew as we increased the fraction of labeled data, eventually reaching better RMSE than the optimal method from Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This resulted in a labeled data set with {a mathematical formula}N=23,119 data points, where 67% of expert predictions were missing.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Both {a mathematical formula}xi and {a mathematical formula}x Ëœ i vectors were always available for all data points.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We used this data set for three sets of experiments: (1) evaluating usefulness of unlabeled data; (2) evaluating usefulness of partitioning; and (3) evaluating usefulness of context-dependent prior over AOD values.</a>
