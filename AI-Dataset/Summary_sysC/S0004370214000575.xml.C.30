<a href="#0" id="0">In the self-interested case, each agent attempts to maximize its individual expected utility as defined above.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the fully cooperative case, the agents are interested in the sum of the individual expected utilities, hence the optimal joint search strategy is the overall-expected-utility-maximizing strategy.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The main question in the fully cooperative case is how to execute the groups' joint search optimally, i.e., such that the overall expected utility is maximized.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the self-interested case, the main question is which search strategies will be used by the individual agents in equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The optimal strategy for the fully cooperative case may dictate that some of the agents should not engage in search at all.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For example, consider the case of k fully cooperative agents where each agent may explore only a single opportunity (i.e., {a mathematical formula}n=1).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this case, the individual (stand-alone) optimal strategy is to explore one opportunity if {a mathematical formula}c<0.5 (since values are drawn from the uniform distribution).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Each agent's expected utility is thus {a mathematical formula}0.5 − c and the overall expected utility is {a mathematical formula}k ⋅ (0.5 − c).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In joint search, where {a mathematical formula}k ′ agents explore their opportunity ({a mathematical formula}1 ≤ k ′ ≤ k), the search cost is {a mathematical formula}k ′ ⋅ c and the expected utility is the maximum of a {a mathematical formula}k ′ -size sample taken from a uniform distribution, which equals {a mathematical formula}k ′ /(k ′ +1) (see [71]).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The expected overall net utility is thus {a mathematical formula}k ⋅ (k ′ k ′ +1) − k ′ ⋅ c which is maximized for different {a mathematical formula}k ′ values, depending on the value of c. In this example, if initially there are {a mathematical formula}k=5 agents then indeed for a cost of {a mathematical formula}c=0.1 it is optimal to have all agents search, however for a cost of {a mathematical formula}c=0.3 it is optimal that only two agents search.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Therefore, the analysis first develops the optimal strategy for the case where subset {a mathematical formula}K ′ ={A1 ′ ,...,Ak ′ ′ } ∈ K of agents engage in search, while the remaining {a mathematical formula}k − k ′ agents do not search.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">A decrease in the search cost of some of the agents that engage in search according to the optimal strategy necessarily increases the overall expected utility.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{sup:8} A solution in this case is a set of search strategies, where each agent's strategy maximizes its own individual expected utility given the search strategies used by the other agents.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The set of strategies available for each agent potentially includes engaging in search to some extent or completely avoiding search.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since it is possible that in the end none of the agents will actually engage in the search, in equilibrium, we define the agents' utilities for such cases as {a mathematical formula}v0.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The agents can use the optimal strategy for the fully-cooperative case with no communication, however, instead of having each agent use its own findings for terminating the search, based on its reservation value, it will consider the best finding obtained so far by any of the agents.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">If all agents are characterized by a common probability distribution of values, i.e., {a mathematical formula}f1(x)=f2(x)=...=fk(x)=f(x), then the problem can be mapped to Morgan's optimal sequential sampling problem [44] (even if the search costs of the different agents vary).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In this problem, a single agent can explore one or more opportunities in any period, where the cost of exploring {a mathematical formula}k ′ opportunities is given by some monotonically increasing function {a mathematical formula}C(k ′ ).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The solution in this case is based on extracting the optimal number of opportunities to explore at each period given the best value obtained so far and the optimal strategy onwards.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In this case, as we prove in the following paragraphs, the agent's strategy needs to take into consideration not only the best value obtained so far, as in the “ no communication ” case, but also the remaining number of potential search periods.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's strategy can thus be represented as the mapping {a mathematical formula}S(v,j) → pij(v), where {a mathematical formula}pij(v) is the probability that {a mathematical formula}Ai will choose to explore an additional opportunity when the number of remaining allowed searches is j and the best value obtained so far by all agents is v. We use {a mathematical formula}EBij(v) to denote the expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai if it follows the optimal search strategy, given the strategies used by the other agents, with j search opportunities remaining, and the best value obtained through all the agents' searches so far is v.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">2 depicts the individual expected utility of the agents, in equilibrium, in a self-interested-agents setting, as a function of the number of agents k. The setting used for this example considers a search horizon of three search periods ({a mathematical formula}n=3) and the search cost is {a mathematical formula}c=0.1.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Finally, we get to the use of continuous communication as a means of improving a joint search.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">There are many examples of individual and overall performance improvement due to the use of communication throughout the search process when the agents are self-interested.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">For example, consider a two-agent case with a search horizon of {a mathematical formula}n=2, a search cost of {a mathematical formula}c=0.01 and a discrete distribution of values, applicable to both agents' searches, where the value obtained is 1 with a probability of 0.5 and otherwise 0.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">When communication is continuous, the totally mixed equilibrium in this case results in an individual expected utility of 0.925.</a>
