<a href="#0" id="0">Absolute-time intervalGiven a plan Π and a plan element {a mathematical formula} 〈 t,a,d 〉 ∈ Π , the absolute-time interval of a condition {a mathematical formula}c ∈ C of action a is a subset of the real numbers {a mathematical formula}ATI(c, 〈 t,a,d 〉 ) defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Finally, we can define the semantics of any STPUD problem P by imposing that each plan obtained by specifying a valid duration for each uncontrollable action is valid for the projected problem of P. This captures the intuitive notion of strong plan: regardless of the actual duration of each uncontrollable action specified in the plan, the execution is valid and all the goals are satisfied.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The scheduling check builds a TN{sup:9} that has the steps of Χ as time points and has a set of constraints composed of duration constraints D and precedence constraints P. Duration constraints (created by the Durations function) are used to bind pairs of snap action instances {a mathematical formula}(siast,sjaet), forcing the duration of each action instance to obey the domain specification ({a mathematical formula}aet − ast ∈ [l,u], being {a mathematical formula}a= ˙ 〈 [l,u],C,E 〉 ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Building a strong plan Σ from a strong schedule for the TNU is analogous to the plain temporal planning case: each pair of corresponding {a mathematical formula} 〈 siast,sjaet 〉 ∈ Χ is a step of Σ , the time for the step is {a mathematical formula} Μ (siast) and, if a is controllable, the duration is {a mathematical formula} Μ (sjaet) − Μ (sjast).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Using a common trick in partial order planning, we consider two fictitious steps, {a mathematical formula}s0 and {a mathematical formula}sn+1, representing the initial state and the goal condition, respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For this abstract plan, the Total Order approach would construct an STNU that is not strongly controllable (nor Consistent) because the {a mathematical formula}visible:=T TIL must happen before the {a mathematical formula}hot:=F one.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this section, we present our compilation technique, which can be used to reduce any planning instance P having duration uncertainty into a temporal planning instance {a mathematical formula}P ′ in which all actions have controllable durations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The first step is to identify the set of variables {a mathematical formula}L ⊆ V that appear as effects of uncontrollable actions and are executed at a time depending on the end of the action.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Specifically, we first fix the maximal duration u as the only allowed duration for {a mathematical formula}a ′ and then add appropriate effects and conditions during the action to capture the uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The effects {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ are partitioned in two sets {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ l and {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ u to capture possible values within the uncertain action execution duration.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula} Since the effect on {a mathematical formula}f Σ (belonging to {a mathematical formula}Ea ′ l) is applied at time {a mathematical formula} Λ (t), the condition is satisfied immediately after the effect and we want to avoid concurrent modifications of either f or {a mathematical formula}f Σ until the uncertainty interval ends at {a mathematical formula} Ν (t).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As we discussed in Section 3.4, it is in general impossible to solve the STPUD problem by considering uncontrollable actions as taking either the maximal or minimal duration of their duration interval: this motivated the development of S-FSSTP and the compilation approaches we presented in Section 6.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In particular, showing that some condition or effect of another action cannot occur within some specific subinterval of action {a mathematical formula}a ′ may require computationally complex reasoning about the ways in which the actions can overlap.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In fact, a plan starting the move action at time 1 would be valid in the simplified problem, but it does not yield a strong plan because the uncontrollable action {a mathematical formula}move could end at time 11 and the ending condition {a mathematical formula} 〈 [etmove]hot=F 〉 would be unsatisfied.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">If {a mathematical formula}a ′ ends at time {a mathematical formula}t+10 and we were to execute a second light-match {a mathematical formula}a2 ′ at time {a mathematical formula}t+12, it's possible that the end-effect {a mathematical formula}light:=false of {a mathematical formula}a ′ , could actually happen at the same time as the start-effect {a mathematical formula}light:=true of {a mathematical formula}a2 ′ , violating the semantics (which prohibits simultaneous effects on a variable).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Let Π be a strong plan for P. {a mathematical formula} Σ Π is a valid temporal plan for R because:</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">It achieves the goal {a mathematical formula}G ′ of R, because all the original goals in G are achieved by Π and by Σ in the same way, and the goals on the shadow variables must be achieved because Π is a strong plan.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In fact, Π achieves the goals regardless of the concrete durations of the actions, therefore it achieves them outside of the uncertainty intervals, where the variables and the shadow variables are aligned because of Lemma 3.Each action {a mathematical formula}a ′ is executable in R, because each {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Π is executable in P regardless of the action durations.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In the translated instance R, all the conditions are also satisfied because the conditions are imposed via the Χ function that only checks that both the variable and its shadow fulfill the original condition.No conflicting effects are possible because of the conditions added in {a mathematical formula}Ca ′ E that prevents any modification of the interested shadow variables during the uncertainty intervals.Similarly, let</a>
