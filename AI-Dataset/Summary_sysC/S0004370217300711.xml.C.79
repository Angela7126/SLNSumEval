<a href="#0" id="0">The most direct approach for solving mina-irrelevance is to test for each (minimal) hitting set {a mathematical formula}S of {a mathematical formula}K, whether there is a MinA that does not contain any of the axioms in {a mathematical formula}S.{sup:2} However, there can be exponentially many such hitting sets in the size of {a mathematical formula}K, which means that this simple approach cannot avoid an exponential execution time in the worst case.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is not difficult to see that, for all types of axioms considered in this paper except for the {a mathematical formula}DL-Litebool family, all-minas is in conp: given an instance of all-minas, a nondeterministic algorithm can guess a subset of {a mathematical formula}K that is not in {a mathematical formula}K, and in polynomial time verify that this is a MinA, thus proving that {a mathematical formula}K is not the set of all MinAs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If {a mathematical formula}M is not the first MinA, a proof of this can be given by guessing a subset of {a mathematical formula}K and verifying in polynomial time that it is a MinA, and it is lexicographically smaller than {a mathematical formula}M. To show conp-hardness, we present a reduction from the np-hard mina-relevance problem of core KBs (see Theorem 7) to the negation of first-mina.Let {a mathematical formula}K, Φ , Ψ be an instance of mina-relevance, and let {a mathematical formula}M be an arbitrary but fixed MinA for Φ in {a mathematical formula}K. {a mathematical formula}M can be computed time polynomial on the size of {a mathematical formula}K as described in the proof of Theorem 17.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}M1 then includes all the consequences that are derivable from one axiom in {a mathematical formula}T. It can be shown through a simple induction argument that for every {a mathematical formula}k ≥ 0, {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Mk iff there is a paired MinA for Φ in {a mathematical formula}HT Φ that uses at most k axioms from {a mathematical formula}T. To avoid an infinite computation, all the sets {a mathematical formula}Mk are restricted to the relevant core clauses, using only the variables obtained from the transformation.</a>
