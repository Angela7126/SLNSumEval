<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we explore the deployment of planning techniques to solve a new class of metric temporal planning problems, characterised by the need to manage both plan trajectory constraints and uncontrollable numeric events.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This combination gives rise to challenges not previously solved in state-of-the-art planners.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We introduce new planning methods to handle these challenges, and demonstrate our approach using a real application domain: voltage control in Alternating Current (AC) electrical networks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Embedding electricity networks in a domain description presents important modelling challenges.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We introduce an encapsulated type, Network, the implementation of which is hidden from the planner.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The effects of actions trigger complex updates to the state of the network.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We distinguish between the direct effects of planned actions, and the indirect effects triggered by them, and we propose a method for integrating a specialised external AC power equation solver with a planner.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We consider a new heuristic function that takes into account the next uncontrollable event, and its interaction with active trajectory constraints, when determining the actions that are helpful in a state.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This lookahead heuristic also exploits an abstraction of the encapsulated Network type to obtain more informative distance estimates.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We conduct experiments to evaluate the benefits of the lookahead heuristic, showing that our approach scales very well with the size of the network and the number of controllable components of the network.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this paper we introduce a general class of metric temporal planning problems characterised by the presence of timed numeric events.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Here we present, in detail, the treatment of a specific example: the management of voltages over time, within an AC power system, given predicted patterns of demand and generation.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We use AI planning as a general framework to tackle the temporal voltage control problem in an active distribution network.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Definition 5</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Universal bounded trajectory management problemA universal bounded trajectory management problem (UBTMP) is a planning problem in which all metric fluents are controllable or uncontrollable and there is a single trajectory constraint of the form:{a mathematical formula} where each {a mathematical formula}Pi is a mixed metric constraint specifying an upper or lower bound on a mixed metric expression.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The role of the finish action is to ensure that the plan extends to the required horizon (in this case, time 10).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Fig.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">2 shows the profile of the background voltage, which increases above the upper bound, requiring the plan to include three actions to decrease the voltage adjustment in order to keep the total voltage value within the bounds.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The mixed metric constraints in this problem are:{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The AC voltage control problem is concerned with maintaining the voltage at each busbar of a distribution network (or a zone of the network) within a given bound, for an extended period of time, assuming that the load profile of consumers and the schedule of the power system generators are known over this period.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We assume deterministic generation.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The inclusion of solar or wind generation would potentially increase forecasting errors and would make a long-horizon plan less robust.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">{sup:2} The voltage at each point of the power system is influenced by different factors: the topology of the network, the load consumption and the power generated.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The decision variables are the tap ratios of transformers, the status of the capacitors and reactors and the level of power demand that can be shed from the network, while the network has to respect the voltage constraint:{a mathematical formula} where N is the total number of busbars present in the network.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">When the solution of a BTMP requires the integration of the planner and an external solver, we have an instance of a two-dimensional problem class with controllable and uncontrollable variables on one axis and {a mathematical formula}Vdep and {a mathematical formula}Vspecial variables on the other.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Fig.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">12 shows this two-dimensional space, divided into four regions.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Classical temporal and metric planning problems occupy the bottom left quadrant, as they require neither uncontrollable variables nor external solvers.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The Simple Voltage problem discussed in Section 4 is in the top left quadrant, being an instance of a BTMP but not requiring any external solver integration.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">By contrast, the AC Voltage Control problem is in the top right quadrant.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">It is a BTMP in which the values of mixed constraints depend on non-linear functions and are computed by an external solver.</a>
