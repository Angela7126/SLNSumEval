<a href="#0" id="0">Definition 5</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The transition part of our framework generates one stable model for each combination of transition paths that leads to a generic space.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The next step in the amalgam-based workflow is to compose transitioned versions of input specifications to generate a candidate blend (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">3).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The key component of this composition process is the categorical colimit [57] of the generalised specifications and the generic space.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This requires also the morphisms from the generic space to the input specifications, which are inherently given with the commonalisation path (see Definition 3).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since the colimit of algebraic specification signatures does not consider consistency and priority information, we need to define a composition operation for prioritised CASL specification, that is based on the colimit but that also considers priorities and consistency.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Composition of PCSThe composition {a mathematical formula}c of n PCS {a mathematical formula}S, a generic space {a mathematical formula}g and one total morphisms {a mathematical formula}m:g ↦ s for each {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S is defined as follows: Let {a mathematical formula}scolimit be the colimit of the PCS without the priorities, i.e., the colimit of the algebraic CASL specifications that underly the PCS.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A classical concept blending example is the blend between the concepts house and boat [34], [27].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In Fig.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">4 we depict the axiomatisation of these concepts which is similar to how they are proposed in [35].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Priorities are equal for all elements in the specifications, so we omit them here for brevity.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The CASL theories for House and Boat introduce the sorts, operators and predicates that form the mental spaces house and boat by focusing on particular properties of these concepts.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The precise formalisation is not critical at this point, different ones exist [35], [63], but all provide similar distinctions.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In principle, the House and Boat specifications could be directly blended (they do not generate any inconsistency), but the blended specification is not considered a good blend since it does not maximise the common relations among the two input specifications.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Instead, more interesting blends are created depending on how the House and Boat are transitioned.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">A house-boat blend is created when the medium on which a house is situated (land) becomes the medium on which boat is situated (water), and the resident of the house becomes the passenger of the boat.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In our system, this is achieved using the generic space depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">5.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">This generic space is obtained by removing the {a mathematical formula}on(house,land) axiom from the House specification, the water operator and the {a mathematical formula}on(boat,water) axiom from the Boat specification, and by renaming the operators ride to liveIn, passenger to resident, boat to house and the sort Boat to House in the Boat specification.</a>
