<a href="#0" id="0">Following these arguments, let w stand for the weight of a piece of evidence and {a mathematical formula}p( Θ ) for the degree of belief to which the evidence points to a single non-empty subset Θ of Θ , or the probability to which the proposition Θ can be proven when the evidence is gathered, we can have the following relationship among support function {a mathematical formula}S( Θ ), weight w and the degree of belief {a mathematical formula}p( Θ ){a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is the only difference between {a mathematical formula}PCR5 ∅ and PCR5.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While this paper is not intended to investigate DSmT in detail, it is worth noting that {a mathematical formula}PCR5 ∅ does not constitute a probabilistic reasoning process for evidence combination as discussed in D – S theory or in classical Bayesian probability theory.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As such, there is a question as to how to interpret the results generated by applying {a mathematical formula}PCR5 ∅ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To illustrate the above arguments, suppose the following two pieces of evidence are given equal weight {a mathematical formula}w1=w2=1 − Γ with {a mathematical formula}0 ⩽ Γ ⩽ 1{a mathematical formula} where A, B and C are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive propositions, and Δ is a small positive real number with {a mathematical formula}0 ⩽ Δ ⩽ 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If Γ is taken as a small number, for example {a mathematical formula} Γ =0.05, applying Dempster ʼ s rule to aggregate the above two discounted BDs (22) and (23) will lead to the following result:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This result makes sense but is not precise, because the aggregated result of the two pieces of evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 with no ignorance at all still includes a belief degree of 0.0256 allocated to the frame of discernment showing a degree of global ignorance, even though the degree 0.0256 is rather small.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It is easy to show that for any {a mathematical formula} Γ >0 the result generated by combining (22) and (23) using Dempster ʼ s rule will always lead to similar imprecise results in the sense that the combined degree of belief in {a mathematical formula}{A,B,C} will always be positive.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Recursive ER rule with weightThe combined degree of belief to which L pieces of independent evidence{a mathematical formula}eiwith weights{a mathematical formula}wi{a mathematical formula}(i=1, … ,L), which are not necessarily normalised, jointly support proposition Θ is given by{a mathematical formula}with{a mathematical formula}m ˆ Θ ,e(L)given by Eqs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">From Definition 4, a piece of evidence can be represented by{a mathematical formula} The above distribution is called Weighted Belief Distribution with Reliability (WBDR).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It is worth noting that in Definition 4 the original specificity of the belief distribution of {a mathematical formula}ei as represented by {a mathematical formula}p Θ ,i is strictly preserved because the following equation always holds{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As discussed before, the PCR5 rule is not a probabilistic reasoning process, so the result it generates is not a probability, nothing to say that the specificity of each piece of evidence has already been changed even before the PCR5 rule is applied.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As such, there is a question as to how to interpret what the results generated by PCR5 actually mean.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">By looking at the final result shown in the last row of Table 4, one obvious concern is that a large portion of the final result is generated as global ignorance with {a mathematical formula}m¯PCR5({A,B,C})=0.3506, as shown in the last row and last column of Table 4.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Hence it may be concluded from this final result that:</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">If any evidence supports proposition Θ , we can always leave that evidence to be last combined without changing the final result due to the commutative property of the orthogonal sum operation.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">So we can have {a mathematical formula}p Θ ,L>0 from the condition of Theorem 6.In the proof of Theorem 5, we showed that {a mathematical formula}m ˆ P( Θ ),e(i)>0 for any {a mathematical formula}i=2, … ,L if Eq.</a>
