<a href="#0" id="0">The heuristic function {a mathematical formula}h( ⋅ ) used by heuristic search algorithms is in fact an estimate of the optimal solution cost.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The sum of the estimated number of nodes of every type is the estimated number of nodes expanded by IDA* with cost bound d for start state {a mathematical formula}s0.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The number of nodes of each type is then estimated for level {a mathematical formula}r+1 of the search.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">SCP predicts i to be the optimal solution cost of start state {a mathematical formula}s ⁎ with i being the first level in which the probability of a goal type existing exceeded a threshold value c set by the user.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that {a mathematical formula} Τ ⁎ B[0] contains only the goal type {a mathematical formula}tg.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This theorem proves that BiSS correctly predicts the optimal solution cost when {a mathematical formula} Γ =1.0 and the number of probes goes to infinity.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">BiSS assumes that subtrees {a mathematical formula}Rs and {a mathematical formula}Rs ′ rooted at nodes s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ of the same type have the same set of types at any level i.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Intuitively, a single probe of BiSS is able to produce a perfect prediction of the optimal solution cost when using a type system that has goal types and obeys Equation (1) for all nodes s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ of the same type, and when {a mathematical formula} Γ =1.0.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For larger values of Γ BiSS will overestimate the optimal solution cost when {a mathematical formula}p=1 so its signed error will be positive.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">BiSS uses the {a mathematical formula}Tc type system with the Out of Place heuristic to predict the optimal solution cost of the instances in I.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">BiSS used the {a mathematical formula}Tgc type system with MD to predict the optimal solution cost of the instances in I.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">BiSS used the {a mathematical formula}Tc type system with the additive pattern databases as heuristic functions [51].</a>
