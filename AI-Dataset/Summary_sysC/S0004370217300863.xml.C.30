<a href="#1" id="1">This section provides a reduction for the function problem of computing a Minimal Correction (for Falsifiability) Subset (FMCFS) of a formula {a mathematical formula}F in CNF.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Regarding the reduction in the proof of Proposition 16, note that a maximal model of {a mathematical formula}F is given by {a mathematical formula}X ∖ M, with {a mathematical formula}M a minimal set over the predicate (15).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Regarding the reduction in the proof of Proposition 22, note that the maximal entailed subset of {a mathematical formula}N given {a mathematical formula}J is given by {a mathematical formula}N ∖ M, being {a mathematical formula}M a minimal set over the predicate (21).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Regarding the reduction in the proof Proposition 23, the computed minimal set {a mathematical formula}T is the complement of the set of backbone literals, which is given by {a mathematical formula}V ∖ T.</a>
