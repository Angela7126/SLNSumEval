<a href="#0" id="0">We could model this using a fluent {a mathematical formula}InPhoneDir(name,number,photo,s), with the following successor state axiom:{a mathematical formula} We could then apply our transformation to this new theory to obtain a bounded action theory, getting precondition axioms such as the following:{a mathematical formula} The resulting theory blocks actions from being performed whenever the action would result in a number of tuples in some fluent exceeding the bound.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For every, possibly open, situation calculus FO formula{a mathematical formula} Φ (x → ,s)uniform in s and with free variables{a mathematical formula}x → , all of object sort, there exists a situation calculus formula{a mathematical formula} Φ ′ (x → ,s)uniform in s, where no action terms occur, such that{a mathematical formula}By induction on the structure of Φ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If Φ is {a mathematical formula}F(t → ,s), we have that, by definition, {a mathematical formula}t → can only contain object terms, so {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ is {a mathematical formula}F(t → ,s).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If Φ is {a mathematical formula}A(y → )=A ′ (y ′ → ), with {a mathematical formula}x → ⊆ y → ∪ y → ′ , if {a mathematical formula}A=A ′ , then {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ is {a mathematical formula}y → =y ′ → , else {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ is ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Indeed, a bounded number of objects yields, up to object renaming, only a bounded number of possible interpretations (of finitely many fluents and constants) at {a mathematical formula}S0.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, for some finite n depending on the theory {a mathematical formula}D and the bound b, we have that {a mathematical formula}ModD=(ModD1,ModD2, … ,ModDn).Since, by Theorem 18, any two models {a mathematical formula}M and {a mathematical formula}M ′ of the generic cell {a mathematical formula}ModDi induce persistence-preserving bisimilar transition systems, then, by Theorem 13, we have that all the models of {a mathematical formula}ModDi satisfy Φ if and only if some model {a mathematical formula}M of {a mathematical formula}ModDi satisfies Φ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, to check whether {a mathematical formula}D ⊨ Φ , we can simply choose one model {a mathematical formula}Mi per cell {a mathematical formula}ModDi, and then check whether, for all {a mathematical formula}i=1, … ,n, {a mathematical formula}Mi ⊨ Φ ; if this is the case, then, and only then, we can conclude that {a mathematical formula}D ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Obviously, for this approach to be effective, we need a model {a mathematical formula}Mi per cell {a mathematical formula}ModDi and a way to perform the check.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We make the assumption that, for a basic action theory {a mathematical formula}D, the maximum number of distinct objects occurring in the state of any situation, dominates the input size of {a mathematical formula}D itself, and that there exists a bound {a mathematical formula}a¯F on the maximum arity of fluents.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Verifying{a mathematical formula} Μ Lpformulas over a situation calculus basic action theory bounded by b, with complete information on the initial situation, can be done in time exponential in b.This is a consequence of Procedure 1 and the complexity of {a mathematical formula} Μ Lp model checking.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since also this check can be performed in exponential time with respect to b (the problem is in NP), we obtain, overall, an exponential time-bound for Procedure 1.Now, recall that propositional Μ -calculus model checking is polynomial with respect to the sizes of the input transition system and the input formula [40].</a>
