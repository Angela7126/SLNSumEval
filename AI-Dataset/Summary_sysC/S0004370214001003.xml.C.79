<a href="#0" id="0">Second, we use the Reference Energy Disaggregation Data set to evaluate the accuracy with which these general models can be tuned to the appliances within a specific household using only aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that general appliance models can be constructed using data from only a small number of appliances (typically 3 – 6 appliances), and furthermore that 28 – 99% of the remaining behaviour which is specific to a single household can be learned using only aggregate data from existing smart meters.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We provide a method by which the general appliance models can be tuned to the appliances within a specific household using only aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We show that models tuned using only aggregate data outperform the general models, and in some cases perform comparably to models learned using sub-metered data from the test appliance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Section 3 we describe how these general models can be tuned to specific appliance instances using only aggregate data from the test house.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In addition, {a mathematical formula}r ˆ off and {a mathematical formula}r ˆ on represent the precision in the mean values between different appliance instances, and therefore {a mathematical formula}r ˆ off would be large since all refrigerators consume close to 0 W when they are off, while {a mathematical formula}r ˆ on would be relatively low since the mean on power of different refrigerator instances varies between approximately 80 W and 250 W. Since the precision parameter, Τ , varies greatly for different states and appliance instances, the hyperparameters {a mathematical formula} Β ˆ and {a mathematical formula}w ˆ are used to provide fairly broad prior distribution.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">To prevent this, we constrain the gamma distribution for the off state ({a mathematical formula}k=1) which is fitted to samples drawn from the posterior distributions such that it follows an exponential distribution, by holding the shape parameter fixed at 1:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Τ 1:M(1:N) ∼ Gamma( Λ ˜ ,r ˜ ) represents sets of {a mathematical formula}1, … ,M samples drawn from the posterior distribution over {a mathematical formula}1, … ,N appliance instances' precision.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This metric represents the likelihood of the test data, x, given a general appliance model, Θ , with both the appliance states z and parameters Θ integrated out, as given by:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}p(x,z| Θ ) is calculated using Eq.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Therefore, in this section we propose a method for learning such behaviour that is unique to a single household, which uses both general appliance models and household aggregate data.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">More formally, this tuning process directly corresponds to learning the parameters {a mathematical formula} Θ (n) for an appliance instance n in a household, given the appliance type's general model Θ and the household's aggregate data x.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We calculate the likelihood that a period of aggregate data was generated by a single appliance instance drawn from a given general appliance model as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}x¯i:j is a window of aggregate data after the base-load has been subtracted, {a mathematical formula}p(x¯i:j| Θ ) is the likelihood of that window of data given the general appliance model Θ as in Eq.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This threshold is set such that the model will accept windows of data which can be explained by a set of appliance parameters drawn from the given appliance type's general model, and reject any windows of data generated by other appliance types or combinations of appliances.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">It is worth noting that the data likelihood {a mathematical formula}p(x¯i:j| Θ ) is inherently dependent upon the variance within an appliance type, since it decreases as the variance of the general appliance model increases.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Once the signatures of a single appliance instance have been extracted from aggregate data, the aim is to tune the general model to include the behaviour of the appliance instance which is unique to the previously unseen household.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Given that both the general model for this appliance type, Θ , and signatures sampled from the specific appliance instance are available, {a mathematical formula}x¯i:j, Bayesian integration [15] provides a natural approach to infer the posterior distribution over such appliance instance parameters with the state sequence marginalised out:{a mathematical formula} Therefore, we update the general model again using variational message passing as described in Appendix A.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">However, it should be noted that the mean power of the on state, {a mathematical formula} Μ k, is just one of the set of appliance model parameters, Θ , and therefore it is not expected that appliances will be uniquely distinguishable using only this parameter.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As in the previous section, we evaluate the extent to which an appliance model explains the appliance's power demand using the logit function applied to the model likelihood, given by Eqs.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For the AT method, the vast majority of the time was required to search for windows of aggregate data which could be explained by the general appliance models with a relatively high likelihood, while only a small amount of time was required to update the general models using the extracted signatures.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Having introduced a method by which general appliance models could be tuned to the specific appliances in a household given only aggregate data, and evaluated its performance using the REDD data set, we showed that the tuning process provides an improvement over using general appliance models and the current state-of-the-art tuning method.</a>
