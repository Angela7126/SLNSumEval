<a href="#0" id="0">As a second contribution, we fix a problem affecting the original version of {a mathematical formula}DLN, that does not fully satisfy an internalized version of the KLM postulate LLE (left logical equivalence) and fails to derive some natural equivalences.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}DL be any classical description logic language and let {a mathematical formula}DLN be the extension of {a mathematical formula}DL with a new concept name {a mathematical formula}NC for each {a mathematical formula}DL concept C. The new concepts are called normality concepts and denote the standard instances of C.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The informal meaning of {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ nD, roughly speaking, is: “ by default, standard instances satisfy{a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D, unless stated otherwise ” , that is, unless some higher priority (possibly strong) axioms entail that standard instances belong to {a mathematical formula}C ⊓ ¬D; in that case, {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ nD is overridden.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The priority relation used in most of the examples of [5] collects those superconcepts with strong axioms only:{a mathematical formula}The second priority relation investigated in [5] is{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}rank( ⋅ ) is shown in Algorithm 1 and corresponds to the ranking function of rational closure adopted in [20], [22].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For all {a mathematical formula}DLN subsumptions and assertions Α , {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Α holds iff {a mathematical formula}KB Σ ⊨ Α , where Σ is any set of normality concepts that contains at least the normality concepts that explicitly occur in {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α }, and {a mathematical formula}KB Σ is a classical knowledge base obtained as follows (recall that {a mathematical formula}KB=S ∪ D):</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Here {a mathematical formula}Bird ⊑ nFlying is not the correct query to pose, because even if a DI is a consequence of {a mathematical formula}KB, it can be overridden, and in this case it has no effect (a DI Δ is entailed if for all normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NC, Δ is either satisfied by the instances {a mathematical formula}NC or overridden in {a mathematical formula}NC, cf.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, consider Reiter's default theories [37]: they are pairs {a mathematical formula} 〈 D,W 〉 where D is a set of default rules and W is a set of classical sentences.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Every set of defaults D is associated to the consequence relation {a mathematical formula}CnD( ⋅ ) that maps each possible W on the set of classical sentences that can be derived from W using the default rules in D[34].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Here, the background knowledge hidden in {an inline-figure} is made explicit by the term {a mathematical formula}KB, and each entailment of the form {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α }{an inline-figure} Β corresponds to the sequent {a mathematical formula} Α {an inline-figure} Β , by analogy with the above example about default logic.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This approach does not have any major side-effects on the properties of {a mathematical formula}DLN since they all rely on the correctness of the translation {a mathematical formula}KB Σ , which has been proved in [5] for all general knowledge bases, not just canonical ones.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Given that DIs are like defaults, it is interesting to compare {a mathematical formula}DLN's consequence relation with those of the other default logics; this will be done in detail in sections 7 and 8.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We informally anticipate that {a mathematical formula}DLN (which is cumulative) lies somewhere in between Default DLs (which are not cumulative) and Lehmann's propositional default logic, which is rational [30].</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">With the additional assumption that consistent concepts have standard instances, the consequence relation of {a mathematical formula}DLN is rational, like that of Lehmann's default logic.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As we pointed out in Remark 1, this can be an interesting method for specializing {a mathematical formula}DLN and tuning the set of its valid axioms when needed, so as to obtain maximum flexibility.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">As explained above, there is no compelling reason for making x an instance of {a mathematical formula}NC, if we do not postulate that there exists a single, concept-independent normality criterion that forces {a mathematical formula}NC to be equal to {a mathematical formula}N(C ⊓ D).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">On the contrary, the instances of {a mathematical formula}C ⊓ D, by definition, satisfy D (be they normal or not), so (63) is overridden and does not belong to the prototype of {a mathematical formula}C ⊓ D, which is consistent.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Still, {a mathematical formula}C ≡ D does not imply {a mathematical formula}NC ≡ ND (LLE states only that {a mathematical formula}NC and {a mathematical formula}ND have the same logical properties), although this would be a reasonable inference to have, in order to enforce the natural principle that equivalents can be substituted for equivalents.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Finally, the notion of semantic consequence is defined as usual: an axiom Ε is a Δ -consequence of {a mathematical formula}KB, written {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ Ε , iff for all Δ -models {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}KB, {a mathematical formula}I{an inline-figure} Δ Ε .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The translation of {a mathematical formula}DLN knowledge bases in classical {a mathematical formula}DL needs one simple change: equation (4) should be replaced with{a mathematical formula} The new translation is correct, as stated by the following theorem.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Let{a mathematical formula}KBbe a general{a mathematical formula}DLNknowledge base, and let Σ be any finite set of normality concepts containing at least all the{a mathematical formula}NCthat occur in{a mathematical formula}KB.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Therefore, under the refined semantics, the restriction of {a mathematical formula}DLN to N-free knowledge bases is almost rational with respect to the postulates in Table 4; the only difference is that CM applies only to consistent normality concepts, as discussed in the previous section.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Let {a mathematical formula}KB be{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Moreover, let Α and Β , respectively, be {a mathematical formula}B1{an inline-figure} ⊥ and {a mathematical formula}B2{an inline-figure} ⊥ , that are equivalent to the strong inclusions {a mathematical formula}B1 ⊑ ⊥ and {a mathematical formula}B2 ⊑ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">It is not hard to see that, according to the rational closure defined in [20], both {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α } and {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Β } entail {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure} ⊥ , that is equivalent to the strong inclusion {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Therefore, the argument in support of the OR rule says that {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α ∨ Β } should entail that C is empty, as well.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">However, in first-order syntax, the intended meaning of such expressions corresponds in fact to a sort of open conditional like {a mathematical formula}C(x){an inline-figure}D(x).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Assume that x is an instance of {a mathematical formula}(T(C) ⊓ T(D))I.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">We must prove that, in accordance with axiom and 1, x is also an instance of {a mathematical formula}(T(C ⊓ D))I.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">By the minimality of i, and since (by hypothesis) {a mathematical formula}KB is N-free and {a mathematical formula}S ⊨ D ⊑ C, we have{a mathematical formula}Claim 1:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The claim is proved by contradiction: assume that {a mathematical formula}X{NC} ⊨ NC ⊑ ⊥ ; then also {a mathematical formula}X{NC} ∪ {NC ⊑ D} ⊨ NC ⊑ ⊥ ; it follows by (90) and the fact that classical inference is insensitive to renaming, that {a mathematical formula}X{ND} ⊨ ND ⊑ ⊥ ; but then {a mathematical formula} Δ i{NC} ∈ KB{NC} ⇔ Δ i{ND} ∈ KB{ND} (a contradiction).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Assume that the premises of CT hold, that is, {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}NC ⊑ D and {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure}N(C ⊓ D) ⊑ E.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Equivalently,{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} We only have to prove that {a mathematical formula}KB{NC} ⊨ NC ⊑ E.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Let{a mathematical formula}KBbe a general{a mathematical formula}DLNknowledge base, and let Σ be any finite set of normality concepts containing at least all the{a mathematical formula}NCthat occur in{a mathematical formula}KB.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">For all normality concepts{a mathematical formula}NC ∈ Σ , and for all{a mathematical formula} Δ i ∈ KB,{a mathematical formula}NC ∈ ovd( Δ i,I)iff{a mathematical formula}The if direction does not need to be changed whereas the only if direction only requires to define the extension {a mathematical formula}J of {a mathematical formula}J0 as previously done in Claim 2 of Lemma 24.</a>
