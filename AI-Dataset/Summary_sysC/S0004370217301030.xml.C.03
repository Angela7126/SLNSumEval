<a href="#0" id="0">The competition called for solvers on four classical computational problems in abstract argumentation frameworks wrt.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Abstract argumentation frameworkAn abstract argumentation framework{a mathematical formula}AF is a tuple {a mathematical formula}AF=(Arg, → ) where {a mathematical formula}Arg is a set of arguments and → is a relation {a mathematical formula} → ⊆ Arg×Arg.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider the abstract argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Arg, →  ) depicted in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An extension E of an argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF=(Arg, → ) is a set of arguments {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ Arg that gives some coherent view on the argumentation underlying {a mathematical formula}AF.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula}AF=(Arg, → ) be an argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A set of arguments {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ Arg is an admissible extension iff it is conflict-free and all {a mathematical formula}A ∈ E are acceptable with respect to E.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A set of arguments {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ Arg is a grounded extension (GR) iff it is complete and E is minimal with respect to set inclusion.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A set of arguments {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ Arg is a preferred extension (PR) iff it is complete and E is maximal with respect to set inclusion.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A set of arguments {a mathematical formula}E ⊆ Arg is a stable extension (ST) iff it is complete and {a mathematical formula}E ∪ E+=Arg.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Consider again the argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF in Fig.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">({a mathematical formula}AF-labeling) Let {a mathematical formula}AF=(Arg, → ) be an abstract argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Together with an ASP encoding for preferred semantics, the answer-sets are in a 1-to-1 correspondence with the preferred extensions of the given argumentation framework {a mathematical formula}AF.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">ASPARTIX-V employs the so-called saturation technique: in the encodings for preferred semantics, a first “ guess ” is made for a set of arguments in the {a mathematical formula}AF, and then the solver verifies if this set is admissible.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The solver implements an approach based on mathematical matrix operations to solve abstract argumentation problems.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">ASPARTIX-D is based on reductions of abstract argumentation problems to answer set programming — see also Section 4 — and therefore exploits the equivalence of stable semantics in abstract argumentation to answer set semantics in a direct way.</a>
