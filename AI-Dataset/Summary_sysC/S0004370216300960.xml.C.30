<a href="#0" id="0">For deterministic actions, we have: Given a formula Φ , a deterministic action a, an observation o, and a state s,{a mathematical formula}s ⊨ rga,o( Φ )iff{a mathematical formula}s ⊨ rga( Ω a,o) ⇒ s ⊨ rga( Φ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}s ⊨ rga,o( Φ ) iff (by definition) {a mathematical formula}s ⊨ rga( Ω a,o → Φ ) iff (1) a is applicable in s, and (2) {a mathematical formula}a(s) ⊨ Ω a,o → Φ ; iff (1') a is applicable in s, and (2') {a mathematical formula}a(s) ⊨ Ω a,o implies {a mathematical formula}a(s) ⊨ Φ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:2} Using Theorem 2, we have (i) a is applicable in s and {a mathematical formula}a(s) ⊨ Ω a,o iff {a mathematical formula}s ⊨ rga( Ω a,o), and (ii) a is applicable in s and {a mathematical formula}a(s) ⊨ Φ iff {a mathematical formula}s ⊨ rga( Φ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Combining (1') and (2') with (i) and (ii), we get: {a mathematical formula}s ⊨ rga,o( Φ ) iff {a mathematical formula}s ⊨ rga( Ω a,o) implies {a mathematical formula}s ⊨ rga( Φ ), as required.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have already seen that, without observations, the regression formula contains only variables relevant to the regressed formula.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, the regression of observations that were received throughout the execution of an action sequence may involve variables that appear in {a mathematical formula} Ω a,o, yet are not relevant for any primitive proposition in Φ .</a>
