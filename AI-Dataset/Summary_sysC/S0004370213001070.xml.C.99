<a href="#0" id="0">Also finding a strategy whose expected utility is within a factor of {a mathematical formula}2p of the maximum expected utility, where p denotes the number of numerical parameters in the model, is NP-hard, even in polytree-shaped diagrams (with variables taking on arbitrarily many values).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A limid can be interpreted as a concise description of the set of Bayesian networks that represent the joint distributions {a mathematical formula}P(S,A| Δ ) induced by strategies Δ . Additionally, as noted by Cooper [25], the expected utility of any strategy Δ in a limid with a single value variable V can be reduced to the computation of the marginal probability {a mathematical formula}P(V ′ =1) in the Bayesian network that represents {a mathematical formula}P(V ′ ,S,A| Δ )=P(V ′ |Pa(V))P(S,A| Δ ), where {a mathematical formula}V ′ is a binary state variable with the same parent set of V, and {a mathematical formula}P(V ′ =1|Pa(V)) ∝ V(Pa(V)).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To understand the rationale of the reduction, consider the asymptotic expected utility of a strategy as the size of the partition problem goes to infinity:{a mathematical formula} which, since {a mathematical formula}limb → ∞ ∑ k=012b( − 1)k[zi/z]k/k!=e − zi/z and {a mathematical formula}limb → ∞ ∑ k=012b1/k!=e,{a mathematical formula} The last expression can be regarded as a function of {a mathematical formula}s Δ =def ∑ i=1nzi Δ i/z, which is a variable that takes values in {a mathematical formula}[0,2] and equals the value of strategy Δ up to the factor z.</a>
