<a href="#0" id="0">In this section we discuss Step 1 of the EML design process, i.e.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">the definition of the core combinatorial structure of the optimization problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Informally, this is the part of the optimization model that can be designed by a domain expert in a traditional fashion.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Defining the combinatorial structure requires one to identify the input and output of the Empirical Model, i.e.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">to define which part of the final model should be extracted from data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This decision affects the Machine Learning techniques that can be used to extract the Empirical Model.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For our example problems, we have already provided a first definition of the core combinatorial structure in the two base models from Section 3.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In both cases, the input of the Empirical Model is given by the mapping variables.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The EM output for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is given by the efficiency of each core: this implies that some kind of regression technique must be used to obtain the Empirical Model.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The output for the {a mathematical formula}WDPmax is a vector of binary variables ({a mathematical formula}effk=1 iff core k has “ high ” efficiency), hence in this case the Empirical Model is a classifier.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Core model for Local Search The Local Search model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is identical to the base model presented in Section 3, and reported here for convenience:</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Core model for MINLP A MINLP model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal can be obtained from the base model by linearizing the objective function:</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Core model for CP We have designed CP models for the two dispatching problems presented in Section 3.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Unlike the LS and MINLP case, in the CP models we represent the mapping decisions via integer variables {a mathematical formula}xi ∈ {0,..,m − 1}, such that {a mathematical formula}xi=k iff job i is mapped on core k. This encoding ensures that a job is always mapped to a single core.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The full model for {a mathematical formula}WDPbal is as follows:</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Empirical models for the{a mathematical formula}WDPbal We used Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the Empirical Model of the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal, for several reasons.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">First, we needed a regression technique because the EM output had to be an efficiency value.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Moreover, ANNs are a classical technique in Machine Learning, they require little domain knowledge, and their modular nature makes them easier to embed in Combinatorial Optimization (see Section 5).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Results for the{a mathematical formula}WDPbal We obtained a LS approach based on the ACPI model for the {a mathematical formula}WDPbal by inserting the {a mathematical formula}hACPI(x) function into the core Local Search model from Section 6.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">An analogous process was followed to obtain a MILP approach.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We solved the problem using a time limit of 90 seconds for Localsolver (after that time no significant improvement was obtained) and of 1 hour for CPLEX (in an effort to prove optimality).</a>
