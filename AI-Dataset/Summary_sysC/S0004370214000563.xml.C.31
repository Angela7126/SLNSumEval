<a href="#0" id="0">If both {a mathematical formula}tj − ti ≤ cij and {a mathematical formula}ti − tj ≤ cji are specified, we will sometimes use the more compact notations {a mathematical formula} − cji ≤ tj − ti ≤ cij or {a mathematical formula}tj − ti ∈ [ − cji,cij].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since we want to solve scheduling problems using STNs, we assume that for each {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T there is a finite interval for scheduling it.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular this means that for each STN {a mathematical formula}S=(T,C) we assume that for all {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T, {a mathematical formula}t ≥ z holds and there exists a finite constant (horizon) {a mathematical formula}hS such that for all {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T it holds that {a mathematical formula}t ≤ hS.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This avoids the use of unbounded time intervals such as {a mathematical formula} − ∞ ≤ ti − tj ≤ ∞ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If we want flexibility to indicate our freedom of choice, then one option for defining the flexibility for scheduling event t is to use the difference {a mathematical formula}flexN(t)=lst(t) − est(t).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{sup:4} The flexibility of an STN S could then be defined as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">First of all, we observe that this metric is defined as the sum of intervals, each interval {a mathematical formula}[at,bt] indicating the flexibility of a single event t. Here, flexibility means freedom to choose a real starting time for the event.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">That is, for every choice {a mathematical formula}v ∈ [at,bt] as a possible starting point of t there is a schedule Σ for S such that {a mathematical formula} Σ (t)=v.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Obviously, for each {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T there are many choices for an interval {a mathematical formula}[at,bt] satisfying this requirement.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Since we would like to determine the maximum flexibility in an STN S, the sum of such interval sizes is required to be maximal.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the introduction we already observed that instead of computing a fixed schedule Σ for an STN S, we would like to compute an interval schedule for S, such that in every interval for an event {a mathematical formula}ti we could freely choose a value {a mathematical formula}vi to compose a schedule {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ for S. First, let us make this notion of an interval schedule more precise:</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Definition 1</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Given an STN {a mathematical formula}S=(T,C), a set {a mathematical formula}IS={It=[lt,ut]|t ∈ T} of (non-empty) intervals for the time point variables {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T is an interval schedule for S iff for every {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T and every {a mathematical formula}vt ∈ [lt,ut], the assignment Σ defined by {a mathematical formula} Σ (t)=vt is a schedule for S.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">It is not difficult to show that any flexibility metric flex satisfying the postulates F1, F2 and {a mathematical formula}F2 ′ defines an interval schedule {a mathematical formula}IS={It|t ∈ T} for an STN S if we define the correspondence {a mathematical formula}IS={flex(t)|t ∈ T}:</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">From this proposition it follows that to compute a flexibility metric for an STN {a mathematical formula}S=(T,C) satisfying F1, F2, {a mathematical formula}F2 ′ and F3, we have to determine</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">1.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">an interval schedule {a mathematical formula}IS={[lt,ut]|t ∈ T} for S, such that</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">2.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">the sum of the interval lengths {a mathematical formula} ∑ t ∈ T(ut − lt) is maximal.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">To solve the first problem (computing an interval schedule) we use a transformation from a given STN to another STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ and we show that any schedule obtained for the latter can be used to obtain an interval schedule for the former.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Note that the resulting set of variables and constraints is just another STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ , we call a double STN.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Using Proposition 5, we show that the schedules of this double STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ can be used to construct an interval schedule for the original STN S:</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Proof</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">First, remember that we always assume a given S to be consistent.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Example 4</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Consider the STN {a mathematical formula}S2 presented in Example 1.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Let STN {a mathematical formula}S2 ′ =(T ′ ,C ′ ) be the double STN derived from S where{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} One possible schedule for {a mathematical formula}S2 is{a mathematical formula} This schedule can be used to construct the following interval schedule for S:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The transformation of an STN S into a double STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ can be used to obtain an interval schedule for S. An arbitrary interval schedule, however, does not suffice to determine the flexibility of an STN, since the sum of the sizes of the intervals obtained does not need to be maximal and therefore does not satisfy F3.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Hence, to obtain the flexibility of an STN, we have to select those solutions Σ for the double STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ that maximize the sum of the sizes of the intervals.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Question: Is there a schedule {a mathematical formula} Σ f:Tc → R for the controllable events {a mathematical formula}ti ∈ Tc such that for every choice of values {a mathematical formula} Ω 1, … , Ω n such that {a mathematical formula} Ω j ∈ [lj,uj] for {a mathematical formula}j=1, … ,n, the function Σ defined by{a mathematical formula} is a schedule for the STN {a mathematical formula}Sc=(Tc ∪ Tu,Cf)?</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Question: Is there a set {a mathematical formula}Ic={Itic:ti ∈ Tc} of intervals for the controllable events such that for every choice of time points {a mathematical formula} Ω 1, … , Ω n such that {a mathematical formula} Ω j ∈ [lj,uj] for {a mathematical formula}j=1, … ,n, and every choice {a mathematical formula}v0, … ,vm − 1 of values such that {a mathematical formula}vi ∈ Itic, the function Σ defined by{a mathematical formula} is a schedule for the STN {a mathematical formula}Sc=(Tc ∪ Tu,Cf)?</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">2.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">in the construction of the double STN we should add equality constraints {a mathematical formula}t − =t ′ − +lt and {a mathematical formula}t+=t ′ ++ut for every contingent constraint {a mathematical formula}t − t ′ ∈ [lt,ut].</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">3.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">For every free constraint {a mathematical formula}t − t ′ ≤ c we should add the constraint {a mathematical formula}t+ − t ′ − ≤ c.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">The problem to ensure that the merge Σ of individual schedules {a mathematical formula} Σ i for {a mathematical formula}Si is always a schedule of the original STN S is known as the so-called Temporal Decoupling Problem[15]:</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">2.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">this optimal decoupling need not affect the flexibility of the system, i.e., we have {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1kflex(Si)=flex(S).</a>
