<a href="#0" id="0">Let K be an inconsistent knowledge base and{a mathematical formula}GKthe MIS-graph of K. Then a subset R of K is a minimal correction subset of K if and only if R is a minimal Y-dominating set of{a mathematical formula}GK.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let K be a knowledge base with a soft constraint {a mathematical formula}C. Then the degree of inconsistency of K in the presence of {a mathematical formula}C, denoted {a mathematical formula}Idr(K|C), is defined as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Essentially, {a mathematical formula}Idr(K|C) is the minimal number of formulas that have to be removed from K to break all the minimal inconsistent subsets of K in the presence of constraint {a mathematical formula}C.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let K be a knowledge base with a hard constraint {a mathematical formula}H=(P,Q) and Α a formula of K. Then the degree of responsibility of Α for the inconsistency of K in the presence of {a mathematical formula}H, denoted {a mathematical formula}dr(K, Α |H), is defined as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Evidently, only formulas involved in minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|Q-dominating sets for {a mathematical formula}GK|H are assigned to nonzero values.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Moreover, the set of formulas corresponding to {a mathematical formula}{T Α } ∪ W → is a {a mathematical formula}Y|{ Α }[C]-dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then there exists at least one minimal {a mathematical formula}Y[C]-dominating set {a mathematical formula}R ′ such that {a mathematical formula}R ′ ⊆ R and {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ R ′ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">On the contrary, it is that {a mathematical formula} Α ∉ R ′ holds for all {a mathematical formula}Y[C]-dominating set {a mathematical formula}R ′ such that {a mathematical formula}R ′ ⊆ R.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This implies that{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}WR ′ → is the vector of variables corresponding to formulas in {a mathematical formula}R ′ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The first item of this proposition shows that only formulas involved in a minimal {a mathematical formula}Y[C]-dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK may be considered as causes of the inconsistency in a knowledge base in the presence of a soft constraint {a mathematical formula}C. This accords with that only formulas involved in minimal {a mathematical formula}Y[C]-dominating sets of {a mathematical formula}GK have to bear nonzero responsibilities for the inconsistency of a knowledge base with the constraint in the context of the measure {a mathematical formula}dr(K, Α |C).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The second item shows that the measure {a mathematical formula}dr(K, Α |C) exactly grasps the degree of responsibility of Α for the inconsistency of K in the presence of {a mathematical formula}C from the point of view of causality.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The first item of this proposition shows that only formulas involved in a minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|Q[C]-dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK|H may be considered as causes of the inconsistency in a knowledge base in the presence of a mixed constraint {a mathematical formula}(H,C).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This accords with that only formulas involved in minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|Q[C]-dominating sets of {a mathematical formula}GK|H have to bear nonzero responsibilities for the inconsistency of a knowledge base with the constraint in the context of the measure {a mathematical formula}dr(K, Α |H,C).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">If there exists at least one minimal {a mathematical formula}Y|{ Α } ∪ Q ′ -dominating set of {a mathematical formula}GK|H ′ , then{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Along this line, the minimum cost of restoring consistency by removing the formulas is not greater than the number of minimal inconsistent subsets, but not less than the number of clusters of minimal inconsistent subsets (according to Proposition 7.3), then it is not surprising that{a mathematical formula} holds for any knowledge base K and any constraints {a mathematical formula}H and {a mathematical formula}C compatible with K.</a>
