<a href="#1" id="1">GroundedWe call {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Lgrounded for O if for each {a mathematical formula}v ∈ L such that {a mathematical formula}O(x ∧ v) ≤ v, it holds that {a mathematical formula}x ≤ v.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We call x a grounded fixpoint of O if it is a fixpoint of O and it is grounded for O.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Example 3.12</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The converse of Proposition 3.11 does not hold.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the logic program {a mathematical formula}P:{a mathematical formula} This logic program has as immediate consequence operator {a mathematical formula}TP:{a mathematical formula} The operator {a mathematical formula}TP is anti-monotone, and {a mathematical formula}{p} is strictly grounded for {a mathematical formula}TP.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, {a mathematical formula}{p} is not a postfixpoint of {a mathematical formula}TP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The A-Kripke – Kleene fixpoint is the {a mathematical formula} ≤ p-least fixpoint of A and has the property that it approximates all fixpoints of O.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this section, we discuss grounded fixpoints in the context of logic programming.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It follows immediately from the algebraical results (Corollary 4.5 and Theorem 4.6) that stable models are grounded fixpoints of the immediate consequence operator and that all grounded fixpoints are minimal fixpoints approximated by the well-founded model.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Furthermore, if the Kripke – Kleene or well-founded model is exact, then it is the unique grounded fixpoint of {a mathematical formula}TP.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Proposition 5.4 shows that U is a 2-unfounded set if and only if its complement satisfies the condition on v in Definition 3.1 if and only if {a mathematical formula}I ∖ U satisfies the condition on y in Definition 3.2.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This allows us to reformulate the condition that I is grounded as follows.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Definition 6.8</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Grounded modelLet {a mathematical formula} Ξ =(S,L,C) be an ADF and {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ L a model of Ξ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We say that X is a grounded model of Ξ if for every set U with {a mathematical formula} ∅ ⊊ U ⊆ X, at least one {a mathematical formula}u ∈ U has support in {a mathematical formula}X ∖ U.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">{a mathematical formula}K Φ (P,C),I=t if for all {a mathematical formula}I ′ ∈ P, {a mathematical formula} Φ (P,C),I ′ =t.</a>
