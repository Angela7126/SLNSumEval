<a href="#0" id="0">Hence, for instance, given a support Α from an argument {a mathematical formula}A to an attack or a support Β , argument {a mathematical formula}A should be accepted in order for the interaction Β to hold.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In general terms, the attack from an argument {a mathematical formula}C to an attack or a support {a mathematical formula} Α =(A,X) will be referred to as {a mathematical formula}(C, Α ); similarly, the support from an argument {a mathematical formula}D to an attack or a support {a mathematical formula} Β =(B,Y) will be referred to as {a mathematical formula}(D, Β ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a result, the attack and support relations of the ASAF are assumed to be disjoint (i.e.,{a mathematical formula}R ∩ S= ∅ ) and thus, a pair {a mathematical formula} Γ =(E,Z) in the attack relation or the support relation will be unequivocally identified by Γ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, by simultaneously having an attack and a support from {a mathematical formula}A to {a mathematical formula}B in a scenario where {a mathematical formula}B is accepted, {a mathematical formula}A would have to be simultaneously accepted and not accepted, reflecting some kind of inconsistency within argument {a mathematical formula}B.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Following the interpretation of support as necessity, such conflicts are handled in [46] by characterizing the notion of extended defeat, which reinforces the acceptability constraints presented in Section 2: given an attack {a mathematical formula}A ⟶ B and a sequence of necessary supports {a mathematical formula}B ⟹ … ⟹ C, there is an extended defeat from {a mathematical formula}A to {a mathematical formula}C.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that since the support relation {a mathematical formula}S is defined so that the source of a support link in an ASAF is an argument (by Definition 11, {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ A×(A ∪ R ∪ S)), all elements in a support sequence but the last one (i.e., the {a mathematical formula}Ai in Definition 15) will be arguments.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Furthermore note that, as expressed by the condition {a mathematical formula}X ∈ (A ∪ R ∪ S) in Definition 15, this does not prevent the last element in a support sequence from being an argument as well.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For instance, in Definition 15, Definition 18, S denotes a set of supports of an ASAF (i.e.,{a mathematical formula}S ⊆ S).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In contrast, in Definition 19, S is used to denote a set of arguments, attacks and/or supports of an ASAF (i.e.,{a mathematical formula}S ⊆ A ∪ R ∪ S).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As a result, argument {a mathematical formula}T will be acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Note that although {a mathematical formula}src( Μ ) is involved in an attack cycle that is not resolved when considering the grounded semantics, the support Μ holds and thus, {a mathematical formula} Μ ∈ G Δ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In particular, even though Λ {a mathematical formula}e-def Δ given{a mathematical formula}{ Θ } and {a mathematical formula}{ Τ , Μ } ⊆ P1 Δ is such that Τ {a mathematical formula}e-def Θ given{a mathematical formula}{ Μ }, as discussed in Example 6, it is also the case that Φ {a mathematical formula}d-def Δ but no elements in {a mathematical formula}P1 Δ allow to obtain a defeat (either unconditional or conditional) on Φ ; therefore, {a mathematical formula} Δ ∉ P1 Δ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Given a support {a mathematical formula} Β =(B,Y), the constraint relating {a mathematical formula}B and Y can be seen (and satisfied) from two points of view.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Since the positive constraint corresponds to the case where the source {a mathematical formula}B (also, the target Y) is accepted (otherwise, if {a mathematical formula}B was not accepted, the negative constraint would have held), a necessary support from {a mathematical formula}B to {a mathematical formula} Β + is included in the associated AFN.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Similarly, the attack from {a mathematical formula}B to {a mathematical formula} Β − models the intuition that if the source {a mathematical formula}B is accepted (thus, the positive constraint would hold), then the negative constraint is not satisfied.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The following lemma formalizes the fact that applying the mapping function {a mathematical formula}Map( ⋅ ) to a complete extension of an ASAF leads to a D-conflict-free set of arguments from its associated AF.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The preceding theorems show that, given an ASAF Δ and its associated AF{a mathematical formula} Δ AF, for each extension {a mathematical formula}E of Δ under a given semantics {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ {complete, preferred, stable, grounded}, there exists a corresponding extension in {a mathematical formula} Δ AF; conversely, for each extension {a mathematical formula}E ′ of {a mathematical formula} Δ AF under a semantics D- Σ there exists a corresponding extension in Δ .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Given a scenario where a support {a mathematical formula} Α =(A,B) holds but the chosen semantics Σ cannot determine whether the positive or the negative constraint associated with Α holds, the translation proposed in [29] is such that neither {a mathematical formula} Α + nor {a mathematical formula} Α − would belong to the corresponding extension of the associated AF under the semantics Σ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In contrast, the translation given in Definition 23 is such that, in cases like the one mentioned above, neither {a mathematical formula} Α + nor {a mathematical formula} Α − would belong to the corresponding extension of the associated AF; notwithstanding this, argument Α would belong to that extension.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">That is, differently from before, argument Β belongs to the grounded extension meaning that, even though the attack cycle between arguments {a mathematical formula}A and {a mathematical formula}B is not resolved by the grounded semantics, the support Β holds.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">In the ASAF, given the support sequence {a mathematical formula}[B, … ,C], by Proposition 5 the acceptability constraints derived from each support link in the sequence are combined to establish the fact that the acceptability of {a mathematical formula}C implies the acceptability of {a mathematical formula}B (equivalently, the non-acceptability of {a mathematical formula}B implies the non-acceptability of {a mathematical formula}C), thus capturing the behavior of the necessary support link from {a mathematical formula}B to {a mathematical formula}C in the AFN.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Each argument {a mathematical formula}A in the graph is associated with an acceptance condition {a mathematical formula}CA, which is some propositional function whose truth status is determined by the corresponding values of the acceptance conditions for those arguments {a mathematical formula}B such that {a mathematical formula}(B,A) is link in the ADF (i.e.,{a mathematical formula}B is a parent of {a mathematical formula}A).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">As a result, argument Β — expressing that “ the support Β is active ” — and argument {a mathematical formula}N Β C — expressing that “ the support Β is valid but not grounded ” — do not belong to the grounded extension either.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We prove the Lemma by showing that the defeats in Δ and the attacks in {a mathematical formula} Φ AF are equivalent in the sense that they lead to the same acceptability constraints on the arguments from Δ and Φ .</a>
