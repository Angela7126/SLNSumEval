<a href="#4" id="4">Minimal setLet P be a monotone predicate over a set {a mathematical formula}R, and let {a mathematical formula}M ⊆ R be such that {a mathematical formula}P(M)=1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The set {a mathematical formula}M is minimal iff {a mathematical formula} ∀ M ′ ⊊ M¬P(M ′ ).</a>

<a href="#7" id="7">MSMP problemGiven a monotone predicate P over a set {a mathematical formula}R, the Minimal Set over a Monotone Predicate (MSMP) problem consists in finding a minimal subset {a mathematical formula}M of {a mathematical formula}R such that {a mathematical formula}P(M) holds.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The first result shows that minimal sets for predicates of form {a mathematical formula}L can be solved by a logarithmic number of calls to an NP witness-oracle.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For predicates of form {a mathematical formula}B, a minimal set can be computed with a polynomial number of non-adaptive calls to an NP oracle, or, with a logarithmic number of calls to an NP witness-oracle.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Lemma 4 together with the fact that {a mathematical formula}MaxSet ∈ FPNP[wit,log] enables constructing a minimal set for predicates of form {a mathematical formula}P whenever the minimal set is unique.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This section extends the results of Section 4 to the case when it is known that there are exactly k minimal sets, for some constant k. Given the results of previous sections, form {a mathematical formula}P is the only predicate form of interest, since function problems represented with predicates of either form {a mathematical formula}L or {a mathematical formula}B can be solved with a logarithmic number of witness oracle calls (see Fig.</a>
