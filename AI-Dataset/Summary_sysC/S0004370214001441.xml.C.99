<a href="#0" id="0">Given that each variable in Z dominates any other variable in {a mathematical formula}Zi,jf, that is not in Z, the term resulting from a matrix M where all the variables in Z are set to 1 will always be subsumed by the term resulting from a matrix {a mathematical formula}M ′ , where any set of variables in Z has been set to 0 in favor of variable outside of Z.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is because, given that the variables in Z dominate the variables outside of Z, each time one variable {a mathematical formula}Z ∈ Z is set to 0 in favor of a variable {a mathematical formula}Z ′ outside of Z, the sort of {a mathematical formula}Z ′ can only be the same or more general, {a mathematical formula}Z ′ can only have a subset of the parents, and a subset of the children of Z.</a>
