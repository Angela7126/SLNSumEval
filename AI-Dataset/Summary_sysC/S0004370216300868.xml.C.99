<a href="#0" id="0">Because social power plays a key role in the cognitive processes that mediate behavior, it is also a key factor for ensuring the believability and effectiveness of an interactive agent system.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, to explore the applicability and potential impact in this area of the model proposed herein, we implemented the model in the virtual characters of a game scenario and performed a user study to assess users' perceptions regarding the social power awareness of agents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a result, we obtained evidence supporting the impact and value of the social power capabilities introduced by the model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This conceptualization of power characterizes it as an individual's personal capabilities that he/she can use to gain compliance and possibly status, which will then result in more voluntary compliance in future interactions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From the perspective of French and Raven, the status/conferral dynamics resulting from the use of power consist of different effects derived from social-power-based interactions that affect the social power structure (e.g., increased liking or decreased perceived expertise) and, therefore, the subsequent potential power that individuals possess in the society and can use to exert influence (claim status in subsequent interactions).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The factors of the second type are the beliefs ({a mathematical formula}BeT,p) that evolve from the agent's interactions in the environment that also affect the different social powers (e.g., a belief regarding another agent's tendency to provide a certain reward).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A value of 0 means that, although identified as a potential influence, the force neither favors nor discourages the performance of C. To determine the actor's overall influence on the target's decision resulting from all potential social-power forces, we assume a simple resultant force approach in accordance with the working definitions of social power and influence (see Section 3.4).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As represented in Formula (2), this overall influence force is the sum of all of the individual potential forces in ISP.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To this end, and despite the fact that the dynamics of certain factors (e.g., changes in social group membership) are beyond the scope of this work, we also detail several aspects that are directly related to each base of social power (e.g., a belief regarding an agent's tendency to coerce).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A legitimate norm social power (n) is a function of the importance of the relevant social group to the target ({a mathematical formula}Importanceg), the intrinsic dutifulness ({a mathematical formula}DutifulnessMT) felt by the target toward the social group, the group norm conformity recognized by the target ({a mathematical formula}ConfT,g) and a norm-related bias ({a mathematical formula}Bias(n)) derived from the agent's association and experience with the social group.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The final attribute that is intimately related to the individual behavior of an agent is the agent's Power Preferences.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Although in general, individual preferences influence most actions to some extent, in considering this attribute, we model only those preferences that are related to the agent's utilization (from the actor's perspective) of social power (e.g., preferences regarding the use of either coercive or referent social power bases).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For instance, with regard to an expert social power, if a given actor uses an expertise strategy (e.g., stating “ You should do this because I have more expertise on this topic ” ), that actor is making a claim of his higher expert social power.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">If the target accepts this claim, then the target is conferring a higher expert social power (compared with the perception of that power before the interaction) to the actor, and the claim becomes permanent.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">If the claim is rejected, this means that the target confers less social power than the actor expected.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Similarly, even in the context of a non-strategic interaction (a simple request to perform a given task without emphasis on any factor related to a social power base), if the target recognizes the higher expert social power of the actor (confers a higher expert social power to the actor), then the actor's claim is simply met.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This is especially relevant for coercive social power because its use requires executing and monitoring the results of the associated coercive action and thus spans more than one round.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Interestingly, in qualitative feedback given by several participants after the experiment, they specifically stated they could not identify what was being studied but, in several instances, mentioned that one set of agents (the SAPIENT agents) appeared more coherent, although they could not explain why.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">As such, although the participants did not know what was being assessed nor, in many instances, could pinpoint a specific difference between the conditions, it is clear that the agents implemented using the SAPIENT model created the perception of strong social power dynamics, resulting in stronger and more positive effects in terms of the interactive experience.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Even so, it might be argued that because the scripted agents received positive ratings, using such agents when implementing agents for social settings is a valid approach requiring much less effort.</a>
