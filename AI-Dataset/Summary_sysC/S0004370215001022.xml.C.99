<a href="#0" id="0">The purpose of the {a mathematical formula} ∑ k=1Kyik=1 for all i constraint is to ensure that the solution to the quadratic program corresponds to a well-defined clustering of the data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As all the variables used are binary, the constraint forces exactly one of the variables {a mathematical formula}yi1, … ,yiK to 1 for all i, which in turn ensures that the corresponding data point {a mathematical formula}vi is assigned to exactly one cluster, as required for a well-defined clustering.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a symmetric similarity matrix W over a set V of data points (recall Section 2.1), the basic idea behind all of our MaxSAT formulations of correlation clustering is that hard clauses are used to enforce that any solution to the MaxSAT instance represents a well-defined clustering (i.e., a mapping {a mathematical formula}cl:V → N).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We start with a comparison of the exact approaches to correlation clustering: our three MaxSAT encodings, the integer linear programming formulation (ILP), and the quadratic integer programming formulation (QIP).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As the size of the transitive encoding and the integer linear program does not depend on the number of non-zero elements in the similarity matrix, for these experiments we created instances by varying the number of points {a mathematical formula}n ≥ 50 in the four protein datasets (Prot1, Prot2, Prot3 and Prot4) by considering only the n first rows and columns of the original similarity matrix of each data set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given a similarity matrix W over a set of data points {a mathematical formula}V={v1, … ,vN}, minimizing disagreements refers to minimizing the number of point pairs {a mathematical formula}vi, {a mathematical formula}vj whose cluster assignment does not agree with their similarity value {a mathematical formula}W(i,j), or more precisely, to finding a clustering cl minimizing{a mathematical formula} Maximizing agreements refers to maximizing the number of pairs of points {a mathematical formula}vi, {a mathematical formula}vj whose cluster assignment agrees with their similarity value {a mathematical formula}W(i,j), or more precisely, to finding a clustering cl maximizing{a mathematical formula} Maximizing correlation refers to maximizing the difference between agreements and disagreements, i.e., using the objective function obtained by substracting Equation (7) from Equation (8).</a>
