<a href="#0" id="0">For{a mathematical formula}G ∈ CB,{a mathematical formula}|G|>1, if G has property{a mathematical formula}CompetenceClosure(G)then G has property{a mathematical formula}CompetenceGroup(G).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Proposition 4 shows that the competence closure model is fully compatible with the competence group model because any competence closure with at least two cases also has the CompetenceGroup property, and is also a competence group.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}S={c1,c4} be a case sample set taken from the case base in Example 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The related closure of S is the set of all related sets that contain at least one element in S. We have{a mathematical formula} thus {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(S)={{c1,c2},{c2,c3,c4},{c1,c2,c3,c4}}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let {a mathematical formula} ℜ 1CB(S)={c1,c2}, the weight of {a mathematical formula}{c1,c2} with regard to S is{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For any case sample set S, the competence-based empirical weight provides a reference to the degree of case distribution on a competence area represented by A – a sub-set of {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(CB).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The higher the weight is, the larger is the proportion of cases in S that support the selected competence area.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For two case sample sets {a mathematical formula}S1,S2 ⊆ CB, we define the competence-based empirical distance between {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given a case base of finite size CB and a case sample set{a mathematical formula}S ⊆ CB,{a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(S)is a finite set.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Since each case c in CB corresponds to a related set – {a mathematical formula}RCB(c) (whereas several cases may correspond to the same related set) the size of {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(CB) must be less, or equal to, the size of the case base.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Again, according to the definition of related closure (Definition 7), for any case sample set {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ CB, {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(S) ⊆ ℜ CB(CB), we have {a mathematical formula}| ℜ CB(S)| ⩽ | ℜ CB(CB)| ⩽ |CB|.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As the size of the case base is finite, {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(S) must be a finite set.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To construct the competence model, {a mathematical formula}d Ε is set to 0.05.</a>
