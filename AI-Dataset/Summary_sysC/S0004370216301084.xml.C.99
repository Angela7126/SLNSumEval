<a href="#0" id="0">Then the cost of a path s with respect to X is defined as{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} ℓ e(X) is the amount of flow passing through edge e, defined as{a mathematical formula} A useful property of the choice vector X is that as each player i chooses path s with probability {a mathematical formula} Π i,s=xi,sn, the expected value of each {a mathematical formula}Xi,s is exactly {a mathematical formula}xi,s, which implies that {a mathematical formula}E[Xi]=xi for each i and {a mathematical formula}E[X]=x.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As in [29], we assume that the cost functions satisfy the property that for any {a mathematical formula}y ∈ [0,1] and any {a mathematical formula}e ∈ E, {a mathematical formula}ce(0)=0, {a mathematical formula}ce(1) ≤ 1, {a mathematical formula}ce ′ (y) ≥ A>0 and {a mathematical formula}0 ≤ ce ″ (y) ≤ B, where {a mathematical formula}A,B are positive constants.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then we can conclude that their distributions at step t are all the same,{sup:12} which basically can be described by the flow {a mathematical formula}xit of player i, due to the law of large number as the number of agents is huge.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, the settings for the two definitions of the game also match.</a>
