<a href="#0" id="0">In {a mathematical formula}M ′ there must be a world {a mathematical formula}w ′ , with {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (w ′ )=0 such that {a mathematical formula}M ′ ,w ′ ⊨ A.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For all propositional formulas {a mathematical formula}B ∈ L, such that {a mathematical formula}M ′ ,w ′ ⊨ B, it must be the case that {a mathematical formula}Ci that does not satisfy {a mathematical formula} ⊤ | ∼ ¬B in {a mathematical formula}M ′ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, for all propositional formulas {a mathematical formula}B ∈ L, such that {a mathematical formula}M ′ ,w ′ ⊨ B, {a mathematical formula}Ci ⊭ ⊤ | ∼ ¬B.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}B ′ be the conjunction of all these Bs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Clearly, A is one of the conjuncts of {a mathematical formula}B ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, {a mathematical formula}Ci ⊭ ⊤ | ∼ ¬B ′ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By Proposition 4, from {a mathematical formula}Ci ⊭ ⊤ | ∼ ¬B ′ , it follows that {a mathematical formula}K ⊭ B ′ | ∼ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let v be the truth assignment associated with the world {a mathematical formula}w ′ of {a mathematical formula}M ′ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Then v is compatible with K. Since {a mathematical formula}M is a canonical model, there must be a world {a mathematical formula}w ∈ W of {a mathematical formula}M such that for all propositional formulas {a mathematical formula}B ∈ L, {a mathematical formula}M,w ⊨ B if and only if {a mathematical formula}v(B)=true.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In particular, we have that {a mathematical formula}M,w ⊨ A.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We show that, for all {a mathematical formula}D| ∼ B ∈ Ci, {a mathematical formula}M,w ⊨ D → B.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Observe that D and B are propositional formulas and that their valuation is the same in w and in {a mathematical formula}w ′ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Hence it is sufficient to show that {a mathematical formula}M ′ ,w ′ ⊨ D → B, for all {a mathematical formula}D| ∼ B ∈ Ci.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This follows from the fact that {a mathematical formula}M ′ ,w ′ ⊨ D| ∼ B holds for all {a mathematical formula}D| ∼ B ∈ Ci.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Indeed, if {a mathematical formula}M ′ ,w ′ ⊭ D, it trivially holds that {a mathematical formula}M ′ ,w ′ ⊨ D → B.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">If {a mathematical formula}M ′ ,w ′ ⊨ D, then (since {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (w ′ )=0), {a mathematical formula}w ′ ∈ Min< ′ M ′ (D), and hence {a mathematical formula}M ′ ,w ′ ⊨ B.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Thus, {a mathematical formula}M ′ ,w ′ ⊨ D → B.Now, there is a world {a mathematical formula}w ∈ W such that, for all {a mathematical formula}D| ∼ B ∈ Ci, w satisfies {a mathematical formula}D → B.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">By Proposition 7, {a mathematical formula}kM(w) ≤ i.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Since w satisfies A, {a mathematical formula}kM(A) ≤ i.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">As by Proposition 2 we know that {a mathematical formula}kM(A) ≥ i, we can conclude that {a mathematical formula}kM(A)=i.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">(If part) This direction is obvious, given the only if part: if {a mathematical formula}kM(A)=i, then {a mathematical formula}rank(A)=i.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Indeed, by absurd, if {a mathematical formula}rank(A)=j ≠ i, then {a mathematical formula}kM(A)=j ≠ i, against the hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Let {a mathematical formula}M ′ = 〈 W ′ ,< ′ ,V ′ 〉 be a model of {a mathematical formula}K ″ minimal with respect to {a mathematical formula}<VIMS that does not satisfy {a mathematical formula}A| ∼ B, i.e., such that {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (A ∧ ¬B) ≤ kM ′ (A ∧ B).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We want to show that also {a mathematical formula}M ⊭ A| ∼ B, i.e., {a mathematical formula}kM(A ∧ ¬B) ≤ kM(A ∧ B).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">For a contradiction, suppose in the canonical {a mathematical formula}M, {a mathematical formula}kM(A ∧ ¬B)=j>kM(A ∧ B)=i.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">By Proposition 2, Proposition 8, {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (A ∧ ¬B) ≥ j and {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (A ∧ B) ≥ i, and since by hypothesis {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (A ∧ ¬B) ≤ kM ′ (A ∧ B), it follows that {a mathematical formula}kM ′ (A ∧ B) ≥ j>i.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">We show that this goes against the minimality of {a mathematical formula}M ′ .From {a mathematical formula}M and {a mathematical formula}M ′ we build a model {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ = 〈 W ⁎ ,< ⁎ ,V ⁎ 〉 such that {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ is a model of {a mathematical formula}K ″ and {a mathematical formula}M ⁎ <VIMSM ′ .</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">A model {a mathematical formula}M for a finite knowledge base K has the form {a mathematical formula}M=({true,false}ATM,kM) where {a mathematical formula}{true,false}ATM is the set of propositional interpretations for, say, a fixed finite propositional language, and {a mathematical formula}kM is our height function mapping propositional interpretations to {a mathematical formula}N, the definition of height {a mathematical formula}kM(A) of a formula is the same as in our semantic.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">the assertion {a mathematical formula}CL(a) is entailed from K, written {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ ALC+TRCL(a), if {a mathematical formula}aI ∈ CLI holds in all models {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 Δ ,<,I 〉 satisfying K.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">As usual, when, for a given knowledge base K and a concept C, it holds that {a mathematical formula}K ⊭ ALC+TRC ⊑ ⊥ we say that C is satisfiable with respect to K.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">As an easy consequence of Theorem 6, we prove the following corollary:</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">The intuition is that a canonical model contains all the individuals that enjoy properties that are consistent with the knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">This is needed when reasoning about the (relative) rank of the concepts: it is important to have them all represented.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">As we will see in Theorem 7, in {a mathematical formula}ALC the existence of a canonical model is guaranteed for any consistent knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Let {a mathematical formula}{C1, … ,Cr} be the maximal consistent set of concepts of which y is an instance.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">We can show that {a mathematical formula}{C1, … ,Cr} is consistent with K. Indeed, we can define a new model of K by adding to {a mathematical formula}M all the domain elements in {a mathematical formula}M ″ , including y, by keeping the interpretation of concepts and relations on such elements as in {a mathematical formula}M ″ and by letting the rank {a mathematical formula}kM(y)=i − 1 and {a mathematical formula}kM(z)=n+1 (where n is the highest rank in {a mathematical formula}M), for all {a mathematical formula}z ∈ Δ ″ such that {a mathematical formula}z ≠ y.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Let {a mathematical formula}Mi= 〈 Δ i,<i,Ii 〉 be the model, considered few lines above in this proof, such that {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Δ i is an instance of C. Starting from a finite model {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 Δ ,<,I 〉 of K ({a mathematical formula}M exists by the finite model property, Theorem 6), we add to {a mathematical formula}M all the domain elements of {a mathematical formula}Mi.We define the resulting model {a mathematical formula}M ′ = 〈 Δ ′ ,< ′ ,I ′ 〉 as follows: {a mathematical formula} Δ ′ = Δ ∪ Δ i; {a mathematical formula}I ′ is defined on the elements of Δ as I in {a mathematical formula}M, and on the elements of {a mathematical formula} Δ i as {a mathematical formula}Ii in {a mathematical formula}Mi.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">For a contradiction, let us assume that {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D ∉ TBox¯.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Then, by definition of {a mathematical formula}TBox¯, it must be: {a mathematical formula}K ⊭ ALC+TRC ⊑ D.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Hence, {a mathematical formula}K ⊭ ALC+TRC ⊓ ¬D ⊑ ⊥ , and the set of concepts {a mathematical formula}{C,¬D} is consistent with K. As {a mathematical formula}M is a canonical model of K, there must be an element {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Δ such that {a mathematical formula}x ∈ (C ⊓ ¬D)I.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">This contradicts the fact that {a mathematical formula}CI ⊆ DI.In case (2), assume {a mathematical formula}M satisfies {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Otherwise, let us assume that {a mathematical formula}kM(C)=i.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Since {a mathematical formula}M satisfies {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D, {a mathematical formula}kM(C ⊓ D)<kM(C ⊓ ¬D), then {a mathematical formula}kM(C ⊓ ¬D)>i.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">By Proposition 13, {a mathematical formula}rank(C)=i and {a mathematical formula}rank(C ⊓ ¬D)>i.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">Hence, by Definition 22, {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D ∈ TBox¯.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">(Only if part) If {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D ∈ TBox¯, then, by definition of {a mathematical formula}TBox¯, {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ ALC+TRC ⊑ D.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Therefore, each minimal canonical model {a mathematical formula}M of K satisfies {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D.If {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D ∈ TBox¯, then by Definition 22, either (a) {a mathematical formula}rank(C)<rank(C ⊓ ¬D), or (b) C has no rank.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">Let {a mathematical formula}M be any minimal canonical model of K. In the case (a), by Proposition 13, {a mathematical formula}kM(C)<kM(C ⊓ ¬D), which entails {a mathematical formula}kM(C ⊓ D)<kM(C ⊓ ¬D).</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">Hence {a mathematical formula}M satisfies {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">In case (b), by Proposition 13, C has no rank in {a mathematical formula}M, hence {a mathematical formula}M satisfies {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">For a strict inclusion {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D the problem of deciding whether {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ D ∈ TBox¯ is clearly in ExpTime as, by definition of {a mathematical formula}TBox¯ (Definition 22), it amounts to check whether {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ ALC+TRC ⊑ D (Theorem 5).</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">The problem of deciding whether {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D ∈ TBox¯ is in ExpTime as well.</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">The definition of rational closure of a knowledge base K considered so far only exploits the ABox (and, in particular, the typicality assertions {a mathematical formula}T(C)(a) in the ABox) to determine the exceptionality of concepts and hence to build the sequence {a mathematical formula}TBox0,TBox1, … ,TBoxn of subsets of TBox required to define {a mathematical formula}TBox¯, and to reason about concept inclusions.</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">We address the question of the ABox by first considering the semantic aspect, in order to treat individuals explicitly mentioned in the ABox in a uniform way with respect to the other domain elements: as for all the domain elements we would like to attribute to each individual constant named in the ABox the lowest possible rank.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">So we further refine Definition 25 by taking into account the interpretation of individual constants of the ABox: given two minimal canonical models {a mathematical formula}M and {a mathematical formula}M ′ , we will prefer {a mathematical formula}M to {a mathematical formula}M ′ if there is an individual constant b occurring in ABox such that {a mathematical formula}kM(bI)<kM(bI ′ ) (whereas {a mathematical formula}kM(aI) ≤ kM(aI ′ ) for all other individual constants occurring in ABox).</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">More formally, in order to calculate the rational closure of ABox, written {a mathematical formula}ABox¯, for all individual constants of the ABox we find which is the lowest possible rank they can have in minimal canonical models with respect to Definition 25: the idea is that an individual constant {a mathematical formula}ai can have a given rank {a mathematical formula}kj(ai) just in case it is compatible with all the inclusions of the TBox that do not contain the T operator or that have a {a mathematical formula}T(C) on the left side with C's rank {a mathematical formula} ≥ kj(ai) (the inclusions whose antecedent C's rank is {a mathematical formula}<kj(ai) do not matter since, in the minimal canonical model, there will be an instance of C with rank {a mathematical formula}<kj(ai) and therefore {a mathematical formula}ai will not be a typical instance of C).</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">An alternative semantic characterization of T can be given by means of a set of postulates that are essentially a reformulation of axioms and rules of nonmonotonic entailment in rational logic R: in this respect, the T-assertion {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D is equivalent to the conditional assertion {a mathematical formula}C| ∼ D in {a mathematical formula}R.{sup:5} Given a domain Δ and a valuation function I, one can define the function {a mathematical formula}fT(S) for {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ Δ that selects the typical instances of S, and in case {a mathematical formula}S=CI for a concept C, it selects the typical instances of C. In this semantics, we define {a mathematical formula}(T(C))I=fT(CI), and {a mathematical formula}fT has the intuitive properties for all subsets S of Δ of Definition 28 below:</a>
