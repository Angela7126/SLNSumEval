<a href="#0" id="0">In the classical random k-SAT model, a random formula {a mathematical formula}Fk(n,m) is a set of m clauses over n variables, where clauses are chosen uniformly and independently among all {a mathematical formula}2k(nk) non-trivial clauses of length k. A non-trivial clause of length k contains k distinct, non-complementary literals.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper we present a new model of random formulas: the Community Attachment (CA) model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is parametric in a probability p and a number of communities c of the set of variables.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It allows the generation of formulas of any desired modularity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Notice that the previous lower-bound of the modularity depends of the graph model used to represent the formula.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For instance, the CVIG model [10] uses a bi-partite structure to represent both variables and clauses into nodes, and puts an edge between a variable-node and a clause-node when that variable appears in that clause.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If, instead of the VIG model, we use the CVIG {a mathematical formula}G ′ ,{sup:2} we can get a lower-bound {a mathematical formula}E[Q(G ′ )] ≥ p − p/c.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Notice, however, that in the case we use the definition of modularity for bi-partite graphs, which is slightly different.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In Algorithm 1, there is an implementation of the Community Attachment random formulas generator from {a mathematical formula}Fk(n,m,c,p).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Using {a mathematical formula}p=Q+1/c these formulas will have an expected modularity close to Q.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">1, we represent the VIG of an instance generated with {a mathematical formula}n=200 variables, {a mathematical formula}m=425 clauses, modularity {a mathematical formula}Q=0.8 and {a mathematical formula}c=40 communities.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In order to analyze the community structure of the SAT instances obtained with our model, we have generated some sets of random formulas for different values of {a mathematical formula}Q ∈ {0.9,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.3} (hence {a mathematical formula}p=Q+1/c), and for different values of number of communities {a mathematical formula}c ∈ {10,20,40,80}.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Each set contains 50 random instances.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Remark that the modularity Q of (real) industrial SAT instances is usually greater than 0.7 [9], while no modularity greater than 0.3 is found for classical random k-CNF formulas.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Moreover, the number of communities c is usually in the interval {a mathematical formula}[10,100][9].</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In a second experiment, we generate families of instances with the same number of variables n and the same clause/variable ratios {a mathematical formula}m/n than in the previous experiment, and varying the number of communities c with a fixed modularity {a mathematical formula}Q=0.8.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In this section we check if this phenomenon also exists in the random SAT instances generated with our model, and if the new transition point, noted {a mathematical formula}r ′ , differs from the classical {a mathematical formula}r ′ ≠ r.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">4, we represent the fraction of UNSAT instances for some sets of random formulas with distinct Q, varying the clause/variable ratio {a mathematical formula}m/n.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">We observe that the fraction of UNSAT formulas increases with {a mathematical formula}m/n.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Therefore, for small (big) values of {a mathematical formula}m/n, nearly all formulas are SAT (UNSAT).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">When Q is small, the value {a mathematical formula}r ′ is close to the classical {a mathematical formula}r ≈ 4.26.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Recall that when {a mathematical formula}p ≈ 1/c, our model is quite similar to the classical random k-SAT model.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">However, we also observe that, when Q increases, {a mathematical formula}r ′ decreases.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">We use sets of instances from {a mathematical formula}Fk(n,m,c,p) with a clause/variable ratio {a mathematical formula}m/n in the phase transition point, a number of communities {a mathematical formula}c=40 and a clause length {a mathematical formula}k=3.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Also, we use a random SAT instance of the family from our model with {a mathematical formula}n=1000 variables, {a mathematical formula}m=4200 clauses, clause length {a mathematical formula}k=3, modularity {a mathematical formula}Q=0.8 and {a mathematical formula}c=10 communities.</a>
