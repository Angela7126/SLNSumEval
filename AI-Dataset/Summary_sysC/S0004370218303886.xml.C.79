<a href="#0" id="0">One of the reasons for the success of modal logic is that in many relevant cases a syntactic scheme corresponds to an additional constraint on the accessibility relation {a mathematical formula}Ra: in the case of (i), reflexivity of {a mathematical formula}Ra is, in a precise sense, sufficient and necessary for its validity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We can then define a notion of validity ⊨ on frames and formulate the result mentioned above as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Observe that, by using an analogy with monadic second-order logic, the class of full frames corresponds to the basic interpretation of sopml, where any frame is uniquely identified by fixing the set W of worlds and accessibility relations, as the domain D is equal to {a mathematical formula}2W.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To assess the expressivity ofsopelin knowledge representation, we contrast it with comparative epistemic logic – cel[18].celextends propositional modal logic with formulas{a mathematical formula}a ≽ b, the intuitive interpretation of which is: agent b knows at least as much as agent a. Semantically, the clause for satisfaction of such formulas at world w in model{a mathematical formula}Mis given as{a mathematical formula}In this sense{a mathematical formula}a ≽ balso expresses a local property of frame{a mathematical formula}F, namely the inclusion{a mathematical formula}Rb(w) ⊆ Ra(w).We show that the comparison between agent a's and agent b's knowledge can be recast insopelas{a mathematical formula}In particular, the RHS of (5) is tantamount to the satisfaction of (6) at w, whenever model{a mathematical formula}Mis full.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As regards the interpretation of MSO and FO (First-Order) formulas, an assignment Ρ now is a function associating a world {a mathematical formula}w ∈ W to every individual variable x, and a set {a mathematical formula}U ∈ D to every predicate variable P. For {a mathematical formula}w ∈ W and {a mathematical formula}U ∈ D, the variants {a mathematical formula} Ρ wx and {a mathematical formula} Ρ UP are defined similarly to sopml.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Recalling that operator ⊡ is part of the object language of lpml, [18] then adds to the basic modal logic K, for specific formulas {a mathematical formula} Θ ⊡ ∈ Lml, an axiom {a mathematical formula}Ax ⊡ and an inference rule {a mathematical formula}R ⊡ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As an example, we provide proofs in logic{a mathematical formula}Kapof the following theorems and derived inference rules, which will be routinely used in the rest of the section, often without explicit mention:</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Theorem 33 guarantees completeness of a logic of sort x, with respect to models of type {a mathematical formula}x ˆ , for the sorts of atomic propositions and propositional and modal formulas.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The proof structure is similar to the one for Lemma 35, namely, we define a sequence {a mathematical formula} Φ 0, Φ 1, … of sets of formulas over {a mathematical formula}AP ∪ Y as follows:{a mathematical formula}We prove by induction on n that every {a mathematical formula} Φ n is consistent (and well-defined).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">EquivalenceGiven a frame{a mathematical formula}F, let ∼ be the equivalence relation on W such that for every state{a mathematical formula}w,w ′ ∈ W,{a mathematical formula}w ∼ w ′ implies that for every{a mathematical formula}U ∈ D,{a mathematical formula}w ∈ Uiff{a mathematical formula}w ′ ∈ U.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Further, denote by{a mathematical formula}[w]={w ′ ∈ W|w ′ ∼ w}the equivalence class of w in{a mathematical formula}F, and for a set{a mathematical formula}U ⊆ W, let{a mathematical formula}[U]be{a mathematical formula}{[w]|w ∈ U}.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The proof strategy that we use is very similar to the one used in the proof of Theorem 57: we define formulas {a mathematical formula} Ξ grid, {a mathematical formula} Ξ sane and {a mathematical formula} Ξ T that serve the same purpose as {a mathematical formula} Ψ grid, {a mathematical formula} Ψ sane and {a mathematical formula} Ψ T, respectively.</a>
