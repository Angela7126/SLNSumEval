<a href="#0" id="0">C is a prime implicate of a function f if it is an implicate of f and there is no other implicate {a mathematical formula}C ′ of f subsuming C. We say that CNF formula Φ is prime if it contains only prime implicates.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A clause C is called 1-provable with respect to a CNF formula Φ , if {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ ¬C ⊢ 1 ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By adding this implicate to Φ we get a propagation complete formula{a mathematical formula} The fact that {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ is propagation complete follows from the fact that it consists of all prime implicates of Φ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A CNF decomposition of a propagation algorithm (propagator) {a mathematical formula}fP is a formula in CNF {a mathematical formula} Φ P over variables {a mathematical formula}x ∪ y such that</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Unit propagation on {a mathematical formula} Φ P produces the empty clause when {a mathematical formula}fP(D(X))= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">First let us recall that a formula Φ is unit refutation complete if for every implicate C of Φ we have that {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ ¬C ⊢ 1 ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consider the following formula Φ :{a mathematical formula} This is a prime CNF which has only one more prime implicate {a mathematical formula}C=(a ∨ b ∨ c ∨ d) produced by resolving the two clauses in Φ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We shall show that C is an implicate of Φ if and only if {a mathematical formula}C ′ is an empowering implicate of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ with {a mathematical formula}x¯ as the empowered literal.Let C be an implicate of Φ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">C is clearly an implicate of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ , and hence also {a mathematical formula}C ′ is an implicate of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, to falsify {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ it must falsify Φ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In particular, we shall show that if a clause C is an empowering implicate of a CNF formula Φ , we can always extend C by adding suitable literals to obtain clause {a mathematical formula}C ′ which is still empowering and moreover we can check that {a mathematical formula}C ′ is an implicate of Φ simply by unit resolution.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">From Theorem 4.2 it follows that there is an empowering 1-provable implicate {a mathematical formula}C Φ of Φ with an empowered literal ℓ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula} Φ ′ ≡ Φ ∧ ¬C Φ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Since {a mathematical formula}C Φ is 1-provable it follows that {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ ⊢ 1 ⊥ , i.e.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In this way we shall obtain a resolution proof of a clause {a mathematical formula}C ′ ⊆ C Φ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Note also that formula {a mathematical formula} Φ n is anti-Horn (i.e.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The formula {a mathematical formula} Φ n in the previous theorem had at most one negative literal in each clause.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In case W does not contain a perfect matching {a mathematical formula} Φ W is not unit refutation complete and thus it is not propagation complete as well.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">if W contains a perfect matching, then {a mathematical formula} Φ W is unit refutation complete, but it still not propagation complete.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">With every instance {a mathematical formula}X,Y,Z,W of 3DM we associate a CNF formula {a mathematical formula} Φ W as follows.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The CNF formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ =A1 ∧ ⋯ ∧ Aq has no unit clauses and thus unit propagation will not derive anything from it.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Let us consider implicate {a mathematical formula}H1 from Example 5.3 and let us show how it can be derived by resolutions from formula {a mathematical formula} Φ W.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Thus {a mathematical formula}H1 is indeed an empowering implicate of {a mathematical formula} Φ W.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Consider how such a tied chain in {a mathematical formula} Φ W may look like.</a>
