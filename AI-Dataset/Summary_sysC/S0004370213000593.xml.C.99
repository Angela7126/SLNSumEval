<a href="#0" id="0">An (extension-based) semantics, Σ , is said to be unique status if for every AF{a mathematical formula} 〈 X,A 〉 it holds that {a mathematical formula}|E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )|=1, otherwise the semantics is said to be multiple status.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For Σ a unique status semantics, {a mathematical formula}E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 ) denotes the unique set of arguments in {a mathematical formula}E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 ), i.e {a mathematical formula}E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )={E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )} for unique status semantics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Interestingly, even for resolution-based preferred extensions (which we do not explicitly consider in this paper), {a mathematical formula}Epr ⁎ ={{P,F},{Q,B}}=Egr ⁎ , so that, again, {a mathematical formula}Epr ⁎ ie= ∅ but {a mathematical formula}{F,B} is both admissible with no attacking argument satisfying {a mathematical formula}capr ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence Proposition 3 and Proposition 4 fail to hold for base semantics which are resolution based.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, Algorithm 1 is not fully satisfying, as it cannot capture all interesting base semantics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula} ⋂ i=1nEi= ⋂ E ∈ E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )E. This is by the fact that the number of guessed extensions is equal to the number of arguments in the framework.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, for every guess it holds that {a mathematical formula} ⋂ E ∈ E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )E ⊆ Ssa.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If {a mathematical formula}x ∈ E Σ ie( 〈 X,A 〉 ), i.e.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">there is an admissible set {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊆ ⋂ E ∈ E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )E with {a mathematical formula}x ∈ S ′ , then for every such guess, we have {a mathematical formula}S ′ ⊆ Ssa and thus {a mathematical formula}x ∈ A.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Hence the algorithm does not accept such an instance.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let us now consider the case that {a mathematical formula}x ∉ E Σ ie( 〈 X,A 〉 ), i.e.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">for {a mathematical formula}S ′ being the maximal admissible set of {a mathematical formula} ⋂ E ∈ E Σ ( 〈 X,A 〉 )E we have {a mathematical formula}x ∉ S ′ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">By Theorem 5 and the fact that {a mathematical formula}sanaive ∈ L we have that computing the ideal extension is in fp.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence the mentioned reasoning tasks can be decided in P. Using the characterisation from Proposition 6 we get a better upper bound for the problem {a mathematical formula}vernaiveidl.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In less formal terms, this assumption states that every simple cycle in {a mathematical formula}H(V) uses at least two distinct values.</a>
