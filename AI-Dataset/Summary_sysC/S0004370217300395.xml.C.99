<a href="#0" id="0">For all {a mathematical formula}DLN subsumptions and assertions Α , {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Α holds iff {a mathematical formula}KB Σ ⊨ Α , where Σ is any set of normality concepts that contains at least the normality concepts that explicitly occur in {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α }, and {a mathematical formula}KB Σ is a classical knowledge base obtained as follows (recall that {a mathematical formula}KB=S ∪ D):</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This explains the rationale behind canonical knowledge bases, that by definition prevent the usage of normality concepts in strong axioms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since the effects of defeasible inclusions are confined to normality concepts, if a query Q contains no such concepts, then it is about certain, valid knowledge; accordingly, Q is entailed by {a mathematical formula}KB if and only it follows classically from the strong axioms of {a mathematical formula}KB.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">On the contrary, if we are interested in inspecting the defeasible consequences of {a mathematical formula}KB, then Q should contain some normality concepts.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Here {a mathematical formula}Bird ⊑ nFlying is not the correct query to pose, because even if a DI is a consequence of {a mathematical formula}KB, it can be overridden, and in this case it has no effect (a DI Δ is entailed if for all normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NC, Δ is either satisfied by the instances {a mathematical formula}NC or overridden in {a mathematical formula}NC, cf.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">There is a reason why the inferences of {a mathematical formula}DLN are so similar to those of [22] in the above examples.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We will show in the following sections that {a mathematical formula}DLN and [22] satisfy similar versions of a set of standard postulates (called KLM postulates) in all the examples where the characteristic features of {a mathematical formula}DLN do not come into play.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This is why the above examples show the different behavior of {a mathematical formula}DLN only in the presence of unresolved conflicts.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The semantics of DIs, however, is different: while the expressions {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure}D are rational sequents, that are required to belong to the knowledge base's consequences, DIs express only default assertions that may be overridden and have no effect.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In this respect, DIs are more similar to Reiter's default rules [37] and Lehmann's version thereof [30]; in particular, in Lehmann's terms, our DIs correspond to the default expressions {a mathematical formula}( Ω : Φ ), not to the sequents {a mathematical formula} Ω {an inline-figure} Φ that represent the consequences of default expressions.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We informally anticipate that {a mathematical formula}DLN (which is cumulative) lies somewhere in between Default DLs (which are not cumulative) and Lehmann's propositional default logic, which is rational [30].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">With the additional assumption that consistent concepts have standard instances, the consequence relation of {a mathematical formula}DLN is rational, like that of Lehmann's default logic.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Finally, the notion of semantic consequence is defined as usual: an axiom Ε is a Δ -consequence of {a mathematical formula}KB, written {a mathematical formula}KB{an inline-figure} Δ Ε , iff for all Δ -models {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}KB, {a mathematical formula}I{an inline-figure} Δ Ε .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For all canonical knowledge bases{a mathematical formula}KB, LLEis sound.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, under the refined semantics, the restriction of {a mathematical formula}DLN to N-free knowledge bases is almost rational with respect to the postulates in Table 4; the only difference is that CM applies only to consistent normality concepts, as discussed in the previous section.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Let {a mathematical formula}KB be{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Moreover, let Α and Β , respectively, be {a mathematical formula}B1{an inline-figure} ⊥ and {a mathematical formula}B2{an inline-figure} ⊥ , that are equivalent to the strong inclusions {a mathematical formula}B1 ⊑ ⊥ and {a mathematical formula}B2 ⊑ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">It is not hard to see that, according to the rational closure defined in [20], both {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α } and {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Β } entail {a mathematical formula}C{an inline-figure} ⊥ , that is equivalent to the strong inclusion {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Therefore, the argument in support of the OR rule says that {a mathematical formula}KB ∪ { Α ∨ Β } should entail that C is empty, as well.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Note that {a mathematical formula} Α ∨ Β can be equivalently expressed using the universal role U as {a mathematical formula} ∃ U.B1 ⊓ ∃ U.B2{an inline-figure} ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Assume that x is an instance of {a mathematical formula}(T(C) ⊓ T(D))I.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We must prove that, in accordance with axiom and 1, x is also an instance of {a mathematical formula}(T(C ⊓ D))I.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The proofs for Section 5 use an interesting lemma that needs the following notation:{a mathematical formula} Informally speaking, {a mathematical formula}NC ∼ ND means that C and D have the same prototype in {a mathematical formula}KB.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Furthermore,{a mathematical formula} denotes the result of substituting D for C in {a mathematical formula}S. The lemma states that if C subsumes D and {a mathematical formula}NC is consistent with D, then C and D have the same prototype ({a mathematical formula}NC ∼ ND).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Assume that the premises of OR hold, equivalently:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} We shall prove {a mathematical formula}KB{N(C ⊔ D)} ⊨ N(C ⊔ D) ⊑ E.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">By Lemma 1, applied to {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ C ⊔ D and {a mathematical formula}D ⊑ C ⊔ D, there are four possibilities:</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">{a mathematical formula}NC ∼ N(C ⊔ D) and {a mathematical formula}ND ∼ N(C ⊔ D);{a mathematical formula}NC ∼ N(C ⊔ D) and {a mathematical formula}KB{N(C ⊔ D)} ⊨ N(C ⊔ D) ⊑ ¬D;{a mathematical formula}KB{N(C ⊔ D)} ⊨ N(C ⊔ D) ⊑ ¬C and {a mathematical formula}ND ∼ N(C ⊔ D);{a mathematical formula}KB{N(C ⊔ D)} ⊨ N(C ⊔ D) ⊑ ¬C and {a mathematical formula}KB{N(C ⊔ D)} ⊨ N(C ⊔ D) ⊑ ¬D.Proof for case</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Let {a mathematical formula}J be an extension of {a mathematical formula}J0 such that, for all normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NH ∉ Σ , we have that{a mathematical formula}By construction, {a mathematical formula}J agrees with {a mathematical formula}J0 on the interpretation of all {a mathematical formula}DL Σ sentences.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Since {a mathematical formula}J0 satisfies {a mathematical formula}S0 Σ , this means that {a mathematical formula}J satisfies {a mathematical formula}S, {a mathematical formula}NH ⊑ H (for all {a mathematical formula}NH ∈ Σ ), and {a mathematical formula}NH ≡ NH ′ (for all {a mathematical formula}NH,NH ′ ∈ Σ such that {a mathematical formula}S ⊨ H ≡ H ′ ).Concerning the normality concepts {a mathematical formula}NH ∉ Σ , we distinguish two cases.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">In the first case there exists {a mathematical formula}NF ∈ Σ such that {a mathematical formula}S ⊨ F ≡ H.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">By construction {a mathematical formula}NHJ=NFJ and, as seen above, {a mathematical formula}J satisfies {a mathematical formula}NF ⊑ F.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Therefore, being {a mathematical formula}J a model of {a mathematical formula}S, we have that {a mathematical formula}J satisfies {a mathematical formula}NH ⊑ H as well.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Moreover, for each G such that {a mathematical formula}S ⊨ G ≡ H, by transitivity {a mathematical formula}S ⊨ G ≡ F, consequently {a mathematical formula}NHJ=NGJ.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">In the second case {a mathematical formula}S ⊭ F ≡ H, for each {a mathematical formula}NF ∈ Σ .</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">By construction, {a mathematical formula}NHJ= ∅ and hence {a mathematical formula}J trivially satisfies {a mathematical formula}NH ⊑ H.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Moreover, if {a mathematical formula}S ⊨ F ≡ H, by hypothesis {a mathematical formula}NFJ is empty as well – otherwise {a mathematical formula}NH would come under the previous case.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Hence, {a mathematical formula}J satisfies {a mathematical formula}NH ≡ NF.So, putting all this together, we have that {a mathematical formula}J is a premodel of {a mathematical formula}S. Moreover, by construction, {a mathematical formula}J satisfies conditions 1 and 2 of Definition 1.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">For all normality concepts{a mathematical formula}NC ∈ Σ , and for all{a mathematical formula} Δ i ∈ KB,{a mathematical formula}NC ∈ ovd( Δ i,I)iff{a mathematical formula}The if direction does not need to be changed whereas the only if direction only requires to define the extension {a mathematical formula}J of {a mathematical formula}J0 as previously done in Claim 2 of Lemma 24.</a>
