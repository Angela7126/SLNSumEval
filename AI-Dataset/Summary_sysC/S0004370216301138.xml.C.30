<a href="#0" id="0">As a consequence, most solvers for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) expose parameters that allow them to be customized to a particular family of instances.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For each the three tracks of CSSC 2013, we configured each of the eleven submitted solvers for each of the benchmark families within the track and aggregated results across the respective test instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show the winners in Table 3 and discuss the results for each track in the following sections.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">2 visualizes the improvements algorithm configuration yielded for the best-performing solver Clasp-3.0.4-p8 on these benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Improvements were particularly large on the GI instances, where algorithm configuration decreased the number of timeouts from 42 to 6.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Table 5 summarizes the results we obtained for all solvers on these benchmarks, showing that configuration also substantially improved the performance of many other solvers.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The table also aggregates results across both benchmark families to yield overall results for the crafted SAT+UNSAT track.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">While Forl-nodrup showed the best default performance and benefited substantially from configuration (#timeouts reduced from 135 to 98), Clasp-3.0.4-p8 improved even more (#timeouts reduced from 139 to 96).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For each of the four tracks of CSSC 2014, we configured the solvers submitted to the track on each of the three benchmark families from that track and aggregated results across the respective test instances.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We show the winners for each track in Table 9 and discuss the results in the following sections.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">6 visualizes the improvements achieved by configuration on these benchmarks for the best-performing solver Clasp-3.0.4-p8.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Clasp-3.0.4-p8 benefited most from configuration on benchmark 3cnf, where it reduced the number of timeouts from 18 to 0.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For the other benchmarks, it could already solve all instances in its default parameter configuration, but configuration helped reduce its average runtime by factors of 3 (K3) and 2 (unif-k5), respectively.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Table 12 summarizes the results of all solvers for these benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We note that solver DCCASat+march-rw showed the best default performance, and that after configuration, it also solved all instances from the three benchmark sets, only ranking behind Clasp-3.0.4-p8 because the latter solved these instances faster.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We used their uniform random split into 250 training and test instances in the 2013 CSSC (random track) and in the 2014 CSSC (random satisfiable track).</a>
