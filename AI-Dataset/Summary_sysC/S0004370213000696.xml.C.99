<a href="#0" id="0">A key insight that aids efficiency is that for a given {a mathematical formula}ai, the optimal sequences for {a mathematical formula}b1 – by are the same as the optimal sequence starting from {a mathematical formula}(ai,b0), other than the first joint action.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The reason is that {a mathematical formula}ai determines Agent B ʼ s next action independently from Agent B ʼ s current action: in all cases, its next action will be {a mathematical formula}bBR(ai).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, Agent A ʼ s task is to select its action, {a mathematical formula}aact, that leads to the best possible joint action of the form {a mathematical formula}(aact,bBR(ai)).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Now working backwards, in order to reach the optimal joint action {a mathematical formula}(ax − 1,by − 1), Agent A must have selected action {a mathematical formula}ax − 1 in the iteration prior to the first appearance of {a mathematical formula}(ax − 1,by − 1) in the sequence.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When that happened, if Agent B had selected anything other than {a mathematical formula}by − 2 ({a mathematical formula}by − 1 is not an option since we are considering the iteration prior to the first appearance of {a mathematical formula}by − 1 in the sequence), then there would have been a payoff of 0, leading to a sequence cost of ⩾ 100.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus joint action {a mathematical formula}(ax − 1,by − 2) must appear in the optimal sequence.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Similarly, considering the first appearance of this joint action, for Agent B to have selected {a mathematical formula}by − 2, Agent A must have selected {a mathematical formula}ax − 2 on the prior iteration.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Again, any joint action other than {a mathematical formula}(ax − 2,by − 3) (here {a mathematical formula}by − 2 is not an option for the same reason as above) leads to a payoff of 0 and a sequence cost of ⩾ 100.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Continuing this line of reasoning, we can see that all the cells under the diagonal must appear in the optimal sequence starting from joint action {a mathematical formula}(a0,b0).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Furthermore, adding any additional joint actions (including those on the diagonal) only raise the cost.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Therefore the sequence presented above, of length x, is indeed {a mathematical formula}S ⁎ (a0,b0).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In particular, in line 12, care needs to be taken to compute {a mathematical formula}S ′ correctly, with Agent B ʼ s action being based on the best response to the current history, and the history being the result of taking action {a mathematical formula}ai from the current history.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To show: there exists a teacher action policy {a mathematical formula} Π ′ starting with {a mathematical formula}Arm ⁎ (or Arm1) that leads to a sequence T with expected value greater than that of S. That is, the initial pull of Arm2 in S does not follow {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ .The underlying idea is that the sequence T should start with the teacher pulling {a mathematical formula}Arm ⁎ repeatedly, and tracking the values obtained by the learner to see if it can ever discern what the sequence S would have looked like after some number of rounds (it simulates sequence S).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To develop intuition, we begin by considering what the teacher should do when {a mathematical formula}r=1 (one action remaining for each agent).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">As shown in Section 3.2, the teacher should never teach when {a mathematical formula}x¯1>x¯2.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">When {a mathematical formula}x¯1<x¯2 (i.e., {a mathematical formula}m1n1<m2n2), there are two conditions that must hold for it to be worthwhile for the teacher to teach.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For example, when {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ =.5, {a mathematical formula}p1=.4, {a mathematical formula}p2=.16, {a mathematical formula}r=4,m2=2, and {a mathematical formula}n2=5 (the same parameters considered at the beginning of this section), the teacher ʼ s optimal action can differ even for identical values of {a mathematical formula}x¯1.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Since there are readily available packages, for example in Java, for computing {a mathematical formula} Φ Μ 1, Σ 1(y), this result can be considered a closed form solution for finding the optimal teacher action and its expected value when {a mathematical formula}r=1.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In contrast, when {a mathematical formula}r>1, there is no such closed form method for finding the optimal action.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">That is, with these values, Inequality (1) is not satisfied, but if {a mathematical formula}x¯1 were 7.01, then it would be satisfied.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Thus we know with certainty that the teacher ʼ s optimal action is {a mathematical formula}Arm ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">When {a mathematical formula}r=2, we can determine experimentally what the teacher ʼ s optimal action is by averaging the results of multiple trials when the teacher starts by teaching vs. not teaching and then acting optimally in the last round.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">To show: there exists a teacher action policy {a mathematical formula} Π ′ starting with {a mathematical formula}Arm ⁎ (or Arm1) that leads to a sequence T with expected value greater than that of S. That is, the initial pull of Arm2 in S does not follow {a mathematical formula} Π ⁎ .In order to define such a policy {a mathematical formula} Π ′ , we define {a mathematical formula}S1(n) and {a mathematical formula}S2(n) as the number of pulls of Arm1 and Arm2 respectively after n total steps of S. As shorthand, we denote {a mathematical formula}S(n)=(S1(n),S2(n)).Similarly, define the number of pulls of Arm1 and Arm2 after n steps of T (e.g.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">That is {a mathematical formula}T(n)>S(m) if at least one of the arms has pulled more times after n steps in T than after m steps in S, and neither arm has been pulled fewer times.Finally, we define the concept of the teacher simulating sequence S based on the knowledge of what values would have resulted from each of the actions, starting with the teacher ʼ s pull of Arm2 at step 1.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The final {a mathematical formula}n ′ − Sim(n ′ ) steps in S include at least one pull of Arm1 or Arm2 (the learner ʼ s first action).</a>
