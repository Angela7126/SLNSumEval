<a href="#0" id="0">AfD obtains {a mathematical formula}S Α by selecting a subset of features from the original state space S with which it can predict the action that a human teacher has taken in a set of demonstrations H. Learning in {a mathematical formula}S Α can be significantly more efficient because a linear reduction in the number of features leads to an exponential reduction in the size of the state space.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The minimum number of samples in ADA, given a set of demonstrations H and parameter {a mathematical formula} Ε ≈ 0.1, is{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}miS,n is the mutual information vector on the original state space S, taking only a subset of n randomly chosen samples from all the samples in H. The subtraction and division are elementwise and the average function takes the average of the values of the resulting vector.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Because of the variability of mutual information, it is necessary to evaluate (4) several times for each possible n, each time with a different and independently chosen set of samples.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Because of the limited sampling bias, the difference between {a mathematical formula}miS → and {a mathematical formula}miS,n → will grow as n decreases, and a binary search can be used to find {a mathematical formula}mss efficiently.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Additionally, by updating the model more frequently, the algorithm explores the interesting parts of the state space faster, and as the policy improves, the approximation focuses on accurately representing the part of the state space that is most often visited by the optimal policy.</a>
