<a href="#0" id="0">Our framework treats a crucial part of the blending process, namely the generalisation of input concepts, as a search problem that is solved by means of modern answer set programming methods to find commonalities among input concepts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An inherent computational problem of conceptual blending is to find a common ground, called generic space, between the two input concepts [27].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The process by which two concepts are blended into a novel idea is seen as a complex event in which particular elements and their relations pertaining to the initial two concepts are combined selectively into a new whole, which is understood to be structurally richer, in a sense we will make precise below, than the mere commonalities of the two concepts.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These are (i) the input spaces that are to be blended, (ii) a partial cross-space mapping that connects counterparts in the input mental spaces, (iii) a generic space that is an abstraction from what the input spaces have in common, (iv) a blending operation that produces a blend of the input spaces and into which the structure of the input spaces is selectively projected, and (v) an emergent structure, i.e., structure that is a synergistic gain to the naive sum of the structure of input spaces.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To this end, a program is partitioned into a base part, describing the static knowledge independent of a step parameter t, a cumulative part, capturing knowledge accumulating with increasing t, and a volatile part specific for each value of t. The grounding and integration of these subprograms into the solving process is completely modular and controllable from a scripting language such as Python.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We write {a mathematical formula}s(t) to denote the specification that results form the t-th transition of {a mathematical formula}s. For example, after the first theory transition, the house concept might be the concept of a house that is not situated on any medium.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since {a mathematical formula}liveIn_ride is commonalised, it carries the information of both input spaces and it should therefore also have the joint priority of both input elements, as implemented by summing up the priorities of the corresponding operators liveIn and ride in the input spaces (see Definition 5).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The issue of how blends are to be evaluated is an important one in the theory of conceptual blending, and in addition to these evaluation metrics, which are generic for any kind of blends, more domain specific criteria can (and eventually should) be added to the blending framework.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the mathematics domain, we present a general approach for using blending to exploit existing creative lemmas in a well understood theory, to automatically generate creative lemmas in another less understood theory.</a>
