<a href="#0" id="0">That is, the result of doing an action a at situation s is the situation {a mathematical formula}do(a,s).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">successor state axioms, of the form {a mathematical formula}f(x → ,do(a,s))=u ≡ Γ f(u,x → ,s), that describe the changes to fluent values after doing actions;</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Formally, we add action likelihood axioms to {a mathematical formula}D:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let{a mathematical formula}Dbe any basic action theory and Φ any{a mathematical formula}L-formula.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then the abbreviations for{a mathematical formula}Bel( Φ ,s)fromDefinition 12, Definition 13define the same number.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For example, if the robot were to now move away by 4 units, the belief in {a mathematical formula}h=4 would then be .2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(Degrees of belief (continuous noisy sensors)) Let Φ be any situation-suppressed {a mathematical formula}L-formula, and {a mathematical formula} Α =[a1, … ,ak] any ground sequence of action terms.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The degree of belief in Φ at s is an abbreviation:{a mathematical formula} where, as in Definition 16, if {a mathematical formula}s=do( Α ,S0) then{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The successor state axiom for h is as in (7), and the one for v is as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}Bel([ ∃ a,s.now=do(a,s) ∧ h(s)>1],do(move(4),S0))=1.It is possible to refer to earlier or later situations using now as the current situation.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This says that after moving, there is full belief that {a mathematical formula}(h>1) held before the action.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, for the fluent h, instead of (7), we will now have:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To make this precise, let us first consider the result of doing a single action a at {a mathematical formula}S0.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The degree of belief in Φ after doing a is now an abbreviation for:{a mathematical formula} where{a mathematical formula} (As before, the i ranges over the indices of the fluents in {a mathematical formula}L, that is, {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,n}.)</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">(Degrees of belief (continuous noisy effectors and sensors)) Suppose Φ is any {a mathematical formula}L-formula.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Then the degree of belief in Φ at s, written {a mathematical formula}Bel( Φ ,s), is defined as an abbreviation:{a mathematical formula} where, if {a mathematical formula}s=do([a1, … ,ak],S0), then{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">(Here, i ranges over {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,n} as before, and j ranges over the indices of the ground actions {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,k}.)</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">That is, given any sequence, for all possible {a mathematical formula}z → values, we consider alternate sequences of ground action terms and integrate the densities of successor situations that satisfy Φ , using the appropriate p-value.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Suppose the basic action theory {a mathematical formula}D includes the foundational axioms, and the following components.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We imagine two actions in this domain, one of which is the noisy move {a mathematical formula}move(x,y) and a sonar sensing action {a mathematical formula}sonar(z).</a>
