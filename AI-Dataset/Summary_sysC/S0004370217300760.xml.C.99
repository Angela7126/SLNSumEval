<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}Sub_Tree_LB(Ak,vi) is the currently best known lower bound on the cost of the sub tree rooted at each child {a mathematical formula}Ak ({a mathematical formula} ≠ Aj), given the partial assignment {a mathematical formula}CPA ∪ {vi}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The best known {a mathematical formula}Sub_Tree_LB(Ak,vi) starts as the sum of all LB_Reports received from members of that sub tree.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When that sub tree finishes its search for a specific assignment {a mathematical formula}vi of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai, the value of {a mathematical formula}Sub_Tree_LB(Ak,vi) for that assignment will be changed to the cost of the best solution of that sub tree.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The next subsections describe the method for obtaining a value for {a mathematical formula}Sub_Tree_LB(Ak,vi) before all LB_Reports have been received.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Each agent holds two variables for holding the value of the current upper bound: {a mathematical formula}Received_UB, which is the upper bound received from the agent's parent, and UB which is the minimum between {a mathematical formula}Received_UB and the upper bound computation from data received from its descendants as described above.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The LB_Reports of all other descendants are received from the agent's parent together with the CPA message.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In order to do so, the agent maintains two separate data structures, one for the LB_Reports received from its parent, and a second one, called {a mathematical formula}LB_Adjust, only for constrained descendants.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The {a mathematical formula}LB_Adjust only contains the difference between the LB_Reports received from the agent's parent, and the LB_Report received directly from the constrained descendant.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As a result, when an agent receives a CPA message it needs no computations, since its added cost for every value {a mathematical formula}vi is already calculated and stored at {a mathematical formula}Local_Costi(parent(Ai),vi) (marked for simplicity as {a mathematical formula}Local_Costi(vi)).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The left side shows the constraints of agent {a mathematical formula}Ag, and the right side shows agent {a mathematical formula}Ag's {a mathematical formula}Local_Cost data structure as it evolves with every LB_Request message.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">When agent {a mathematical formula}Ag receives the first message from {a mathematical formula}Aa containing the assignment {a mathematical formula}va=x it updates its data structure so that {a mathematical formula}Local_Costg(Aa,x)=4 and {a mathematical formula}Local_Costg(Aa,y)=1 directly from {a mathematical formula}Aa.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Note that agent {a mathematical formula}Ag has no Earlier Constrained Agent from {a mathematical formula}Aa since it is the root agent.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This means that {a mathematical formula}Aa is the first agent in the {a mathematical formula}Local_Costg data structure.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Agent {a mathematical formula}Ag sends a LB_Report(1) message to {a mathematical formula}Aa since 1 is the minimal cost in the relevant row.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Next, {a mathematical formula}Ag receives the assignment y from agent {a mathematical formula}Ac and adds the constraint cost it has with that assignment to the costs of the previous line in the data structure (since {a mathematical formula}ECAg(Ac)=Aa).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The LB_Report message sent back to agent {a mathematical formula}Ac will contain the lower bound of 4.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Note, that at this point if agent {a mathematical formula}Ag receives a CPA message the last line of the {a mathematical formula}Local_Cost data structure will contain the sum of its constraints cost with all other agents, for each of its possible value assignment.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The last message in the example is a new value assignment from agent {a mathematical formula}Ac.</a>
