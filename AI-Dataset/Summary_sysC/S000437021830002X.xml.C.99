<a href="#0" id="0">In the context of SAT, one often considers structural restrictions on a graphical representation of the formula (such as the primal graph), and the aim is to design efficient fixed-parameter algorithms for SAT, i.e., algorithms running in time {a mathematical formula}O(f(k)nO(1)) where k is the value of the considered structural parameter for the given SAT instance and n is its input size.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For the following considerations, we fix an ILP instance {a mathematical formula}I=(F, Η ) of size n along with a treedepth decomposition T of {a mathematical formula}GI with depth k. Given a variable set Y, the operation of omitting consists of deleting all inequalities containing at least one variable in Y and all variables in Y; formally, omitting Y from I results in the instance {a mathematical formula}I ′ =(F ′ , Η ′ ) where {a mathematical formula}F ′ =F ∖ F(Y) and {a mathematical formula} Η ′ is obtained by removing all variables in Y from Η .</a>
