<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:1} The importance of the acting part has been largely underestimated, and insufficient attention has been given to the numerous AI problems that emerge when attempting to integrate acting with planning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consequently, in contrast with successful AI fields such as machine learning, the deployment of automated planning techniques into fielded applications has remained relatively low despite its large potential.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Both the refinement and adaptation mechanisms can be designed through an approach based on our vision, where the HOM facility is an actor that can be organized into a hierarchy of reasoning functions, where each abstract action can be a task to be further refined and planned for, and where online planning and acting are performed continually in order to adapt and repair plans.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We need to provide refinement mechanisms that can be triggered at run-time whenever an abstract action in a procedure needs to be refined or an adaptation needs to be taken into account, in agreement with our idea that the actor (integrating planning and acting) should be the primary topic of investigation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Making the right predictions from the combined models of actions and skills, as well as from additional models of the environment, is a difficult problem that involves heterogeneous representations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, autonomous acting requires extended perception capabilities: sensing actions as well as querying and information gathering steps, combined into a consistent interpretation of the environment.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">They include in particular AI problems such as anchoring and symbol grounding (i.e., establish, maintain and revise signals-to-symbols relations), reasoning on what is observable and what is not, integrating knowledge-gathering actions to environment changing actions, acting in order to maintain a consistent interpretation of self and the world, dynamic situation and plan-recognition problems.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For instance, in HOM we can abstract away possible effects of exogenous events (such as a car being damaged, or a storage area being not available) and plan accordingly to a more simple model than the nondeterministic one.</a>
