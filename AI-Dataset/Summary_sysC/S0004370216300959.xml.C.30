<a href="#0" id="0">More formally, a bitaxonomy is a pair {a mathematical formula}B=(TP,TC) of taxonomies, where {a mathematical formula}TP is the taxonomy for the Wikipedia pages and {a mathematical formula}TC is the taxonomy for the Wikipedia categories.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}TP ({a mathematical formula}TC) is defined as the set of hypernymy edges output by our algorithm for the page (category) side of Wikipedia, that is, {a mathematical formula}TP={(p,p ′ )|p,p ′ ∈ Pandpis-ap ′ } ({a mathematical formula}TC={(c,c ′ )|c,c ′ ∈ Candcis-ac ′ }), where P (C) is the set of all Wikipedia pages (categories).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to induce the English Wikipedia bitaxonomy, i.e., a taxonomy of pages and categories, we proceed in 3 phases:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Creation of the initial page taxonomy: we first create a taxonomy for the Wikipedia pages by i) parsing the textual definitions of each page and extracting the hypernym lemma(s) and ii) by disambiguating each hypernym lemma according to the Wikipedia sense inventory.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To understand the relevance of this step, consider that MultiWiBi succeeded in extracting more than one hypernym lemma for about 12% of all the English Wikipedia pages.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">5a plots the coverage of the Wikipedia pages as hypernym linkers are applied in the presented order.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Two lines are shown: the blue line plots the number of pages with at least one hypernym, the green line shows the number of total hypernyms found up to a certain phase.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Again, since MultiWiBi extracts more than one hypernym lemma for any given page, the total number of hypernyms is higher than the total number of Wikipedia pages.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Wikipedia pages We first report the results of the knowledge resources which provide page hypernyms, i.e., we compare against WikiNet, DBpedia, MENTA, YAGO3 and LHD.</a>
