<a href="#0" id="0">In particular, we did not consider states where a holed object was partially crossing another hole, as in Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">2(a), or the formation of string loops as in Fig.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">2(b).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If {a mathematical formula}pass(se,h+) is executed, we would get {a mathematical formula}chain(s)=[sb − ,h+,se+] depicted as state 1 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If the next movement is {a mathematical formula}pass(se,h − ) the effect of that action, according to [11], was completely “ pulling ” back from the string tip {a mathematical formula}se leaving {a mathematical formula}chain(s)=[sb − ,se+] free again, as in state 3 in Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For instance, to allow the transition from state 2 to state 3, pulling from a string segment to undo a single loop is required.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Moreover, in some situations we can also require the opposite movement, that is, passing from state 3 to state 2 by just picking the string without actually moving its tips.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To sum up, we define two new actions, {a mathematical formula}pick(s:i,f) and {a mathematical formula}pull(s:i,f), that respectively allow picking or pulling some string segment {a mathematical formula}s:i toward a hole face f. The direct effects of these two actions are represented in Fig.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">11, which shows the effect of picking from left to right and the effect of pulling in the opposite direction.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As we can see in Fig.</a>
