<a href="#1" id="1">Consider policy tree {a mathematical formula}T, chance constraint h, and the indicator random variable{a mathematical formula} representing the test discussed in Definition 3.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the actual satisfaction probability Δ provided by a policy tree {a mathematical formula}T with respect to constraint h in {a mathematical formula}P is exactly equal to {a mathematical formula} Β − Θ , Τ takes value 1 with probability {a mathematical formula}1 − Α .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An {a mathematical formula}( Α , Θ )-solution set to an SCSP {a mathematical formula}P is a set of policy trees.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">All policy trees in this set simultaneously provide, with probability at least Α , a satisfaction probability greater than or equal to {a mathematical formula} Β i − Θ for every chance constraint {a mathematical formula}hi in {a mathematical formula}P with satisfaction threshold {a mathematical formula} Β i.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A set of policy trees that are solutions to {a mathematical formula}P ˆ for a sample size N computed as discussed in Definition 7 is an approximate {a mathematical formula}( Α , Θ )-solution set for {a mathematical formula}P.</a>
