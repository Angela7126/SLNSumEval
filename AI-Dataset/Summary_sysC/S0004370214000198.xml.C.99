<a href="#0" id="0">In the proof of Lemma 2 we already showed that the variables in {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} have to be false before applying action {a mathematical formula}u11, implying that no action can change the value of a variable in {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} before {a mathematical formula}u11.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The action subsequence from Lemma 2 applies action {a mathematical formula}u21 in the partial state {a mathematical formula}{a,b¯,x}, in which no action on {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} is applicable, making it impossible for any plan to change the value of a variable in {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} after {a mathematical formula}u21.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Another direct consequence of Lemma 2 is that the variables in {a mathematical formula}{a,b,x} have to be false in the initial state; we can therefore say that a loop instance U has implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}U¯.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since {a mathematical formula}b1 is false before action {a mathematical formula}u111, conditional loop instance {a mathematical formula}U2 is activated, and to apply the action pair {a mathematical formula}(u101,u111) we have to solve the partial planning instance {a mathematical formula}P2 ′ with implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}U¯2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This corresponds to solving the partial planning problem {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ , which has implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}V¯i+1 ′ since variables in {a mathematical formula}{ai+1,bi+1,xi+1} have to be false for {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ to be solvable due to Lemma 2 and, if {a mathematical formula}i+1<n, we recursively have to satisfy the implicit initial state {a mathematical formula}V¯i+2 ′ of {a mathematical formula}Pi+2 ′ to apply the action pair {a mathematical formula}(u(i+1)01,u(i+1)11) while {a mathematical formula}bi+1 is false.Let {a mathematical formula} Ω i+1 be a plan solving {a mathematical formula}Pi+1 ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">He did not prove a result for a bounded number k of preconditions, but conjectured that plan existence falls into the polynomial hierarchy in a regular way, with the precise complexity determined by k. In this section we modify our previous reduction such that actions have at most two preconditions, thus showing that plan existence is PSPACE-complete for {a mathematical formula}k=2 and proving Bylander's conjecture to be wrong.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Just as before we define two partial planning instances {a mathematical formula}Pi1 ″ (pi) and {a mathematical formula}Pi2 ″ (pi) for each {a mathematical formula}1 ⩽ i ⩽ n and each assignment {a mathematical formula}pi.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The goal of {a mathematical formula}Pi1 ″ (pi) is {a mathematical formula}ui9, while the goal of {a mathematical formula}Pi2 ″ (pi) is {a mathematical formula}vi9.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In spite of the differences between {a mathematical formula}PF and {a mathematical formula}PF ′ , the mechanism is the same: for each {a mathematical formula}1 ⩽ i ⩽ n, the planning instance {a mathematical formula}Pi1 ″ (pi) has associated modified loop instance {a mathematical formula}Ui1={ai,bi,xi,ui3,ui4,ui5,ui6}, while {a mathematical formula}Pi2 ″ (pi) has alternative modified loop instances {a mathematical formula}Ui1 and {a mathematical formula}Ui2={ai,bi,xi,vi3,vi4,vi5,vi6}.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It is easy to prove the equivalent of Lemma 12, Lemma 15 for the variables in {a mathematical formula}Vi ′ : while solving {a mathematical formula}Pi1 ″ (pi) or {a mathematical formula}Pi2 ″ (pi), we cannot make a variable in {a mathematical formula}Vi ′ true and then false, and when subsequently making {a mathematical formula}ui9 and {a mathematical formula}vi9 false while {a mathematical formula}bi − 1 is true, all variables in {a mathematical formula}Vi ′ become false.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then Lemma 17 implies that there exists a plan solving {a mathematical formula}PF ″ .Let {a mathematical formula}L(m,n) be the bound on the optimal plan length of the planning instance {a mathematical formula}PF from Lemma 11.</a>
