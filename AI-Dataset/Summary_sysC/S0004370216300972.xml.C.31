<a href="#0" id="0">If some {a mathematical formula}hi is a linear function, then {a mathematical formula} − hi is also discretely convex.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, one can put a lower bound {a mathematical formula}f_ on {a mathematical formula} ∑ i ∈ [1,n]fi(xi) and run the propagator twice, first with constraint (1) being {a mathematical formula} ∑ i ∈ [1,n]fi(xi) ≤ f ‾ , and then with constraint (1) being {a mathematical formula} − ∑ i ∈ [1,n]fi(xi) ≤ − f_.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If {a mathematical formula}gi is a characteristic function, then {a mathematical formula}fi can be any function.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A characteristic function may be used to count, as in the case of the Count family of constraints (e.g., Among[14], [15]).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">But characteristic functions can also be used to represent the Maximum constraint with a fixed maximum m. Indeed, the constraint {a mathematical formula}m=maxi ∈ [1,n] ⁡ xi can be decomposed into {a mathematical formula} ∀ i ∈ [1,n]:m ≥ xi ∧ ∑ 1 ∈ [1,n][xi=m] ≥ 1.</a>
