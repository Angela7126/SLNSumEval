<a href="#0" id="0">With two pieces of independent and fully reliable evidence represented by two bpas {a mathematical formula}m1 and {a mathematical formula}m2 respectively, for any proposition {a mathematical formula} Θ ⊆ Θ , Dempster ʼ s rule is given as follows [25]{a mathematical formula} where ⊕ is the orthogonal sum operator.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Shafer ʼ s discountingSuppose {a mathematical formula}p( Θ ) is the degree of belief to which a piece of evidence points to a proposition Θ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We name the first term as the bounded sum of individual support from each of the two pieces of evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 for the proposition that an alternative is assessed to {a mathematical formula} Θ n.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">As such, the specificity of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei is kept intact.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that {a mathematical formula}mP( Θ ),i=1 − wi is the residual support of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei incurred due to its weight and there is {a mathematical formula} ∑ Θ ⊆ Θ m Θ ,i+mP( Θ ),i=wi ∑ Θ ⊆ Θ p Θ ,i+(1 − wi)=1 since {a mathematical formula} ∑ Θ ⊆ Θ p Θ ,i=1 in Eq.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Suppose {a mathematical formula} Θ ={A,B} and there are two pieces of independent evidence {a mathematical formula}e1 and {a mathematical formula}e2 given by {a mathematical formula}e1={(A,0.8),(B,0.2)} and {a mathematical formula}e2={(A,0.4),(B,0.6)}, both of which are complete without any ignorance, that is they are both Bayesian probability distributions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The results generated by {a mathematical formula}PCR5 ∅ are different from those of Dempster ʼ s rule or the ER rule.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If there is global ignorance in any evidence however, the separation between {a mathematical formula}m( Θ ) and {a mathematical formula}m(P( Θ )) and the redistribution of {a mathematical formula}m(P( Θ )) become impossible after the combination of evidence by Dempster ʼ s rule.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In Table 2, the results generated by the {a mathematical formula}PCR5 ∅ rule are close to those generated by the ER rule.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This means that if {a mathematical formula}1 − w1=0 the individual support for Θ from the second piece of evidence {a mathematical formula}e2 will not be counted at all, however reliable {a mathematical formula}e2 may be.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The same can be said for the first piece of evidence if {a mathematical formula}1 − w2=0 or {a mathematical formula}1 − w2=1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">ER weighting with reliabilitySuppose {a mathematical formula}wi is the weight of evidence {a mathematical formula}ei defined in Eq.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let {a mathematical formula}re(L) stand for the combined reliability of all L pieces of evidence {a mathematical formula}e(L) and {a mathematical formula}we(L) for the combined weight of {a mathematical formula}e(L).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">(43), it can then be said that {a mathematical formula}re(L) will be one if and only if any of the L pieces of evidence is fully reliable, and otherwise less than one.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Let {a mathematical formula}wi and {a mathematical formula}ri be the weight and reliability of the ith piece of evidence which satisfies the following conditions{a mathematical formula}</a>
