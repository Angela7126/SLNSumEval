<a href="#0" id="0">In particular, the costs of arcs may increase as a result of discovering additional obstacles.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The next lemma proves that w-consistency is preserved when arc costs increase.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the movement phase of a real-time heuristic search algorithm may only increase costs in the search graph, then w-consistency is preserved by the movement phase.Let {a mathematical formula}c ′ denote the cost function after the movement phase.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In a run of wLSS-LRTA* at convergence, for each{a mathematical formula}i ∈ {0, … ,N − 1}, it holds that:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Proof of Theorem 5</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that the cost of the path found by wLSS-LRTA* is:{a mathematical formula} and by Lemma 5:{a mathematical formula} However h is w-consistent and thus w-admissible, hence:{a mathematical formula} which means the solution found is w-optimal.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We evaluated wLSS-LRTA* with six weight values {a mathematical formula}{1,2,4,8,16,32} and nine lookahead values {a mathematical formula}{1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We report the solution cost and the total time per test case obtained by the algorithm for different weight and lookahead values.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Regarding the time per search episode, it is known that the time per search episode increases when the lookahead increases [15], [7].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">On the other hand, when different weights are used for a fixed lookahead value, the time per search episode does not increase.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The number of trials and the total search time obtained by the original algorithm ({a mathematical formula}w=1) are better than the results obtained by the algorithm with w greater than one.</a>
