<a href="#0" id="0">The CC strategy results in a simple local search algorithm for SAT called Swcc, which shows promising experimental results on random 3-SAT instances, and outperforms TNM, the winner of SAT Competition 2009.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The third contribution concerns improving local search algorithms for random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Although the SAT community has made great achievements in solving random 3-SAT instances in the past two decades, the progress lags far behind on random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Specifically, our analysis shows that the CC strategy is effective for random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k<6 and ineffective for those with {a mathematical formula}k ⩾ 6.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also show that the subscore based tie-breaking mechanism is ineffective for random 3-SAT instances, although it is very effective for random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The neighborhood of a variable x is {a mathematical formula}N(x)={y|y occurs in at least one clause with x}, which is the set of all neighboring variables of variable x.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We evaluate Swcc on the 3-SAT Comp09 benchmark, which comprises all large random 3-SAT instances from SAT Competition 2009 ({a mathematical formula}r=4.2, {a mathematical formula}2000 ⩽ n ⩽ 26000, 10 instances each size).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">These experimental results suggest that the CC strategy is more promising than the tabu mechanism in solving random 3-SAT instances.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">3-SAT Comp11: all large random 3-SAT instances from SAT Competition 2011 ({a mathematical formula}r=4.2, {a mathematical formula}2500 ⩽ n ⩽ 50000, 10 instances for each size).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This section improves Swcca for random k-SAT with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Note that the PAWS scheme is adopted by state-of-the-art SLS algorithms for SAT such as Sparrow2011 [3] and EagleUP [15], which show better performance than Swcca on random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">5-SAT benchmark: all large random 5-SAT instances from SAT Competition 2011 ({a mathematical formula}r=20, {a mathematical formula}1000 ⩽ n ⩽ 2000, 10 instances for each size).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Encouragingly, CCAsubscore exhibits much better performance than all these four solvers on both benchmarks, indicating a remarkable progress in solving random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Specifically, CCASat adopts Swcca to solve random 3-SAT and structured instances, and CCAsubscore to solve random k-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}k>3.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A recent local search solver called FrwCB can solve random 3-SAT instances at {a mathematical formula}r=4.2 with up to 4 million variables within reasonable time, but its performance on those with ratio 4.267 is worse than that of CCASat [30].</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">A configuration changed decreasing (CCD) variable is a decreasing variable that {a mathematical formula}confChange(x)=1.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As x is a decreasing variable and {a mathematical formula}confChange(x)=1, x is a CCD variable by definition.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For a random k-SAT formula {a mathematical formula}Fk(n,m), we calculate the size of each variable ʼ s neighborhood in F as following.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">As indicated in Table 14, for random 6-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}n<1500 and 7-SAT instances with {a mathematical formula}n<5000, each variable ʼ s neighborhood consists of more than half of the variables in the formula.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We specially remark that the CC strategy degrades to the tabu method with {a mathematical formula}tt=1 for random 7-SAT instances at {a mathematical formula}r=85 with {a mathematical formula}n<564.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This suggests that the CC strategy is currently not helpful for local search solvers in solving random 7-SAT instances, as we have mentioned before.</a>
