<a href="#0" id="0">In fact, envisioning is complementary to planning methods as it takes a fully instantiated plan (a sequence of parameterized actions) as its input to reason about the effects and the dynamics of manipulation actions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Although they also employ a physics engine for their simulations, they consider actions such as picking up an object only at a very abstract level, whereas we focus on the physical details of such actions in order to recognize qualitative phenomena occurring during their execution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The robot is equipped with knowledge about situated manipulation problems, action plans that describe how to solve these problems, and parameter spaces of primitive actions occurring in the plans.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">There are three ways of asserting an entity: either by naming the entity, if it is already known by the knowledge base including its physical specifications that are needed by the simulator; by providing the physical specifications of a previously unknown entity explicitly; or by providing an object type that can be generated by the object model factory.envision(Scenario, Plan(Params), Timeline)performs a simulation-based temporal projection for an asserted scenario and a fully instantiated robot control program/plan, and returns an ID of the projected timeline.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The contacts fluent is simply defined by the value reported by the simulator:{a mathematical formula} The above fluent retrieves the bounding boxes of both objects and compares them in order to compute its truth value:{a mathematical formula} The Holds predicate, introduced above, can be used to assess a condition at a certain point in time.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The main limitations of these approaches in the context of robotics are threefold: (a) important details such as positions of manipulators and objects are abstracted away; (b) variants of problems such as manipulating an object with different physical properties cannot be handled without extending the logical theory; and (c) consequences of concurrent actions and events are very difficult to foresee with pure symbolic reasoning, e.g., what does a robot see when turning its camera while navigating through its environment?</a>
