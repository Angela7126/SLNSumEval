<a href="#0" id="0">They are based on changes of the assertions in the ontology that enable answer sets.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As it turns out, repair answer sets do not have higher complexity than ordinary answer sets (more precisely, weak and flp answer sets) if queries in DL-atoms are evaluable in polynomial time; to ensure this, we concentrate on the prominent Description Logic DL-{a mathematical formula}LiteA from the DL-Lite family [21].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There are two possibilities: either {a mathematical formula}w(b) ∈ I ′ or {a mathematical formula}w(b) ∉ I ′ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The former can not be true, as then there is some {a mathematical formula}yj(b), such that {a mathematical formula}yj(b) ∉ I ′ , and hence for some rule r of the form (5) we have that r is not satisfied by {a mathematical formula}I ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If the latter holds, then we know that there are no rules of the form (6), whose body is satisfied by {a mathematical formula}I ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider an extension {a mathematical formula} Ν ″ of the assignment Ν to the atoms {a mathematical formula}yj, such that {a mathematical formula} Ν ″ (yj)=true, if {a mathematical formula}yj(b) ∈ I ′ , and {a mathematical formula} Ν ″ (yj)=false otherwise.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We know that {a mathematical formula} Ν ″ ( Φ )=true, i.e.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">there is a disjunct {a mathematical formula} Χ k in Φ , such that {a mathematical formula} Ν ″ ( Χ k)=true.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let us look at the rule {a mathematical formula}rk corresponding to the disjunct {a mathematical formula} Χ k.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">All DL-atoms {a mathematical formula}f(xi) are satisfied by {a mathematical formula}I ′ , due to the construction of the ABox {a mathematical formula}A ′ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The DL-atoms of the forms {a mathematical formula}f(yj) are satisfied by {a mathematical formula}I ′ , because {a mathematical formula}yj(b) ∈ I ′ , and thus {a mathematical formula} Λ I(f(yj)) ⊨ Yj(b).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Similarly, the DL-atoms of the form {a mathematical formula}f(¬yj) are satisfied, as for them we have that {a mathematical formula}yj(b) ∉ I ′ , and thus {a mathematical formula} Λ I(f(¬yj)) ⊨ ¬Yj(b).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Hence {a mathematical formula}I ′ must satisfy {a mathematical formula}B(rk); but since {a mathematical formula}w(b) ∉ I ′ , we have that {a mathematical formula}I ′ ⊭ rk, leading to a contradiction.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We can get to (h) only if {a mathematical formula}I ˆ is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ ; furthermore, by setting {a mathematical formula}SgrI ˆ to {a mathematical formula}Gr(S,I ˆ ,A) in (b) and by the further modifications, it is ensured at (h) that each DL-atom {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Dp has some coherent support set that matches with {a mathematical formula}A ′ (i.e., {a mathematical formula}Gr(S,I ˆ ,A ′ )(a) ≠ ∅ ), while no DL-atom {a mathematical formula}a ′ ∈ Dn has such a support set.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Thus from Proposition 61, it follows that {a mathematical formula}I ˆ is a compatible set for {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T ∪ A ′ ,P 〉 ; hence {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Furthermore, as {a mathematical formula}flpFND(I ˆ ,T ∪ A ′ ,P) succeeds, I is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ flpI,O.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Hence I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ , and thus a deletion repair answer set of Π .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">(Completeness) Suppose I is a deletion repair answer set.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">That is, for some {a mathematical formula}A ′ ⊆ A, we have that I is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ = 〈 T ∪ A ′ ,P 〉 .</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">This implies Proposition 50 that {a mathematical formula}I ˆ is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ and thus will be considered in (b), with {a mathematical formula}Dp and {a mathematical formula}Dn reflecting the (correct) guess for {a mathematical formula}I ⊨ O ′ a for each DL-atom a, where {a mathematical formula}O ′ =T ∪ A ′ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">From Proposition 61 and completeness of S, we obtain that each {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Dp has {a mathematical formula}Gr(S,I ˆ ,A ′ )(a) ≠ ∅ and each {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Dn has {a mathematical formula}Gr(S,I ˆ ,A ′ )(a)= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The initial {a mathematical formula}SgrI ˆ is such that {a mathematical formula}Gr(S,I ˆ ,A ′ )(a) ⊆ SgrI ˆ =Gr(S,I ˆ ,A)(a) holds for each DL-atom a; in further steps, the algorithm removes all support sets {a mathematical formula}S ∈ Gr(S,I ˆ ,A)(a) for {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Dp from {a mathematical formula}SgrI ˆ (a) such that such that {a mathematical formula}S ∩ S ′ ∩ A ≠ ∅ for some support set {a mathematical formula}S ′ ∈ Gr(S,I ˆ ,A)(a ′ ) and {a mathematical formula}a ′ ∈ Dn, and removes all assertions in {a mathematical formula}S ′ ∩ A from {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
