<a href="#0" id="0">Suppose x is grounded and y and x are fixpoints of O with {a mathematical formula}y ≤ x.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Proposition 3.8 guarantees that grounded fixpoints are minimal, hence a monotone operator O can have at most one grounded fixpoint {a mathematical formula}lfp(O).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}(ai,bi)i ≤ Β be a well-founded induction of A and let x be a grounded fixpoint of O.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, if the Kripke – Kleene or well-founded model is exact, then it is the unique grounded fixpoint of {a mathematical formula}TP.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, suppose I is grounded for {a mathematical formula}TP and U is a 2-unfounded set of I.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, M is not a grounded model if and only if {a mathematical formula} Φ I is not a tautology, which is exactly what we needed to show.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We illustrated in Example 4.4 that in this case, stable and grounded model semantics may disagree (since {a mathematical formula}{p,q} is not an ultimate stable model, it certainly is no stable model either).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It can easily be verified that {a mathematical formula}{a,b,c} is the only grounded model of {a mathematical formula}P.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Grounded modelLet {a mathematical formula} Ξ =(S,L,C) be an ADF and {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ L a model of Ξ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We say that X is a grounded model of Ξ if for every set U with {a mathematical formula} ∅ ⊊ U ⊆ X, at least one {a mathematical formula}u ∈ U has support in {a mathematical formula}X ∖ U.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The proof is analogous to the proof of Proposition 5.5.First, suppose X is a grounded fixpoint of {a mathematical formula}G Ξ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Since X is a fixpoint of {a mathematical formula}G Ξ , by definition it is a model of Ξ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Grounded expansionLet {a mathematical formula}T be an AEL theory.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Furthermore, since grounded fixpoints are always minimal in {a mathematical formula} ≤ k, our notion of groundedness is indeed stronger than the notion of moderate groundedness.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Hence {a mathematical formula}Q2 is not grounded.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Its unique grounded expansion is {a mathematical formula}{{p}} but it has no stable extensions and the well-founded extension is three-valued.</a>
