<a href="#0" id="0">The most common method is to strictly alternate between the search directions: expand a node with a minimum {a mathematical formula}gF-value in the forward direction, then one with a minimum {a mathematical formula}gB-value in the backward direction, etc.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It is not a heuristic search algorithm, but, when {a mathematical formula}hF and {a mathematical formula}hB are consistent, it can be made to exactly simulate heuristic search by transforming the edge costs in the state space to take into account the heuristic values, as follows [30].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our pseudocode for MMe does not contain parent pointers, but the proof of Lemma 12 makes use of properties of the “ generating path ” of an open node n, which is the sequence of nodes defined by the parent pointers from n back to {a mathematical formula}start (for forward search, back to {a mathematical formula}goal for backward search).</a>
