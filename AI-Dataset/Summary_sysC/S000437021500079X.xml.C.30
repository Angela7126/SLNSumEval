<a href="#0" id="0">Using these definitions, the automated process of configuring static sequential portfolios can be defined as follows: Given a set of candidate solvers P and a set of training instances I automatically find the portfolio configuration C of solvers {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P such that it maximizes the performance of the resulting portfolio over the given benchmark I.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">compute a portfolio configuration of candidate solvers (which can be just a single solver) for each input problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This portfolio configuration is computed using a set of features extracted from the problem to be solved.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">gop, unlike these approaches, uses the same portfolio for all problems to be solved, which is generated for a given training data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">And the last one solves a MIP task to compute the optimal sequential schedule of candidate solvers that maximizes the number of solved training instances using 10% of the available time.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">3S uses the column generation approach to solve that MIP task.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">First, every candidate solver is executed with every training problem from the input set to generate the raw data.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Second, this raw data is processed to compute the parameters of the MIP model.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Third, the MIP task generates the optimal configuration of a static sequential portfolio for the collection of training problems and candidate solvers.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This optimal configuration is the best linear combination of the candidate solvers with regard to the objective function (maximize coverage or overall quality or minimize time) of the MIP model.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Each task is described in detail next.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The inputs to gop consist of a set of candidate solvers, P, a set of training instances, I, and the available time to solve each instance.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The set of training instances I can be split into subsets called domains.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Each candidate solver {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P is executed with every training instance {a mathematical formula}t ∈ I to obtain the sets {a mathematical formula}Spt of solutions.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In case of solving problems optimally or SAT problems, a candidate solver {a mathematical formula}p ∈ P generates at most one solution {a mathematical formula}s ∈ Spt for each training instance {a mathematical formula}t ∈ I, since s should be optimal (as in the case of Automated Planning) or because it is required only to find a single solution — as in the case of SAT.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">One of the main factors that influences the time required to solve the MIP task defined in the previous section is the size of the training instance set.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Thus, in this section we analyze the question of whether there is a subset of the training problems that results in a portfolio with a similar or even equal performance (measured in overall quality or coverage) with regard to the same set of candidate solvers.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The first experiment aims to compute the OSS portfolio for the sequential optimization track of the IPC 2011, which allows us to analyze the performance of any solver on that particular benchmark.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Since in this experiment we test the performance with the same training instances, the resulting portfolio provides us only with the best achievable performance given the participant planners and instances of the IPC.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Therefore, this experiment does not assess the performance of the OSS portfolio on a different set of instances.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">It analyzes the performance of the awarded planners regarding the upper bound defined by the OSS portfolio.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Therefore, we have computed the OSS portfolio (OSS gop-1) for the new domains defined in the IPC 2011 using the same set of candidate planners considered by fdss and gop-1.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Also, we have generated the vbs, the sbs and the OSS portfolio (OSS IPC) for these domains using all the participant solvers in the IPC 2011.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Table A.7 shows the candidate planners considered to compute the OSS portfolio for the sequential optimization track of the IPC 2011 in Section 6.1.1.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The set of candidate planners used in Section 6.1.3 to assess the performance of the portfolios computed with gop in optimal planning is shown in Table A.8.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">The OSS portfolio for the sequential satisficing track of the IPC 2011 has been configured in Section 6.2.1 with the set of candidate planners shown in Table A.9.</a>
