<a href="#0" id="0">In other words, we are interested in the following problem: Given an argumentation semantics Σ together with a set of subsets of arguments, {a mathematical formula}S, what characteristics of {a mathematical formula}S determine if there is any argumentation framework whose Σ -extensions are exactly the sets forming {a mathematical formula}S?</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As an example, our results for preferred semantics show that {a mathematical formula}S ∈ Σ pref satisfies the condition that for each pair of distinct sets A and B from {a mathematical formula}S there is at least one {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A and one {a mathematical formula}b ∈ B such that a and b do not occur together in any set in {a mathematical formula}S. Thus, for instance, {a mathematical formula}S={{a,b},{c,d},{a,c},{b,d}} is part of the signature {a mathematical formula} Σ pref (the argumentation framework consisting of arguments a, b, c, and d and symmetric attacks between a and d, and b and c, respectively, has {a mathematical formula}S as its preferred extensions) while neither {a mathematical formula}S ∪ {{a,d}} nor {a mathematical formula}S ∪ {{b,c}} are.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, our results prove that there is noafF with {a mathematical formula}pref(F)=S ∪ {{a,d}}={{a,b},{c,d},{a,c},{b,d},{a,d}} (and likewise there is no af with preferred extensions {a mathematical formula}S ∪ {{b,c}}).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, we also give results for the case where {a mathematical formula}S is not given explicitly but by the models of a propositional formula.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To characterize stable, stage and naive extensions, we start with a rather strong restriction making use of the concept of {a mathematical formula}PairsS (in Section 6, we will discuss an alternative yet equivalent definition in terms of a ternary operator on {a mathematical formula}S).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">(2) By definition, the preferred semantics yields at least one extension and for any {a mathematical formula}S,S ′ ∈ Σ (F), {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ S ′ implies {a mathematical formula}S=S ′ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Stable semantics are the only semantics that can realize {a mathematical formula}S= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note that {a mathematical formula}S= ∅ is easily stb-realizable, for instance with the framework {a mathematical formula}({a},{(a,a)}).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In Proposition 1 the only difference between stable and stage semantics was the case {a mathematical formula}S= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The next result will show that this indeed is the only difference between the signatures for stable and stage semantics.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The following relations hold{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}In what follows, we make implicit use of the results from Theorem 1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The stb-realizability problem in which instances are propositional formulas,{a mathematical formula} Φ (X), is{a mathematical formula}coNP-complete.The {a mathematical formula}coNP membership is immediate from Proposition 13.To show that deciding whether {a mathematical formula} Φ (X) is stb-realizable is {a mathematical formula}coNP-hard, we use a reduction from unsat.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The Σ -realizability problem in which instances are propositional formulas,{a mathematical formula} Φ (X), is in{a mathematical formula}DPfor{a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ {pref,stage,sem}.For {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ {pref,stage,sem} we have, with the exception of {a mathematical formula}S Σ ≠ ∅ , shown that the relevant characterizing conditions can be decided in {a mathematical formula}coNP.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The Σ -realizability problem in which instances are propositional formulas,{a mathematical formula} Φ (X), is{a mathematical formula}DP-hard{a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ {pref,stage,sem}.The proof roughly proceeds as follows (a full proof is given in Appendix A.2).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In order for {a mathematical formula}f Φ (X) to describe a system containing comparable sets there must be assignments, Α and Β , for which{a mathematical formula} Checking any given pair {a mathematical formula}( Α , Β ) is polynomial time decidable, hence comparability is in {a mathematical formula}NP as claimed.To show that deciding comparability of {a mathematical formula} Φ (X) is {a mathematical formula}NP-hard, we use a reduction from sat.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Given an instance {a mathematical formula} Ψ (X) of sat, form {a mathematical formula} Φ (X,y,z) as an instance of comparability with{a mathematical formula} Here y and z are new variables.Suppose that {a mathematical formula} Ψ (X) is satisfiable using Α and let {a mathematical formula}S Α ⊆ X be the corresponding subset of X indicated by Α .</a>
