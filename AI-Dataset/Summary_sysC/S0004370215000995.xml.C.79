<a href="#0" id="0">Inspired by two observations: 1) the conflict between proximity and diversity requirements is aggravated with the increase of the number of objectives and 2) the Pareto dominance loses its effectiveness for a high-dimensional space but works well on a low-dimensional space, BiGE converts a given many-objective optimization problem into a bi-goal (objective) optimization problem regarding individuals' proximity and crowding degree, and then handles it using Pareto dominance in this bi-goal domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The bi-goal evolution is implemented with two specific methods of estimating individuals' performance (i.e., proximity and crowding degree), and also with simple individual comparison strategies in the mating and environmental selection.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to make the integration feasible (i.e., to be able to deal with an MOP with non-commensurable objective functions), in BiGE each objective of individuals is normalized (with respect to its minimum and maximum values in the current population) before estimating their proximity and crowding degree.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For some of the test problems (i.e., WFG4 – WFG9), the optimal HV value can be obtained by calculation; for the others, the optimal value is, as suggested in [36], approximately estimated by the HV result of the nondominated set with respect to the mixed population consisting of all the obtained solutions on a given problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Following the recommendation in [45], the reference point is set to 1.1 times the upper bound of the Pareto front (i.e., {a mathematical formula}r=1.1m) to emphasize the balance between proximity and diversity of the obtained solution set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For the two combinatorial optimization problems, since the range of their Pareto front is unknown, we set the reference point slightly worse than the boundary values of the nondominated set with respect to the mixed population consisting of all the obtained solutions; that is, the points with 13,000 and 22 for each objective (i.e., {a mathematical formula}r=13,000m and {a mathematical formula}r=22m) are fixed for the knapsack and TSP problems, respectively.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Although all considered solution sets appear to converge into the optimal front (the upper and lower bounds of objective i in WFG's Pareto front are 0 and {a mathematical formula}2×i, respectively), the six algorithms perform differently in terms of diversity maintenance.</a>
