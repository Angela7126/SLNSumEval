<a href="#0" id="0">Then, we can say that the target values {a mathematical formula}yi are sampled from the following Gaussian distribution,{a mathematical formula} Further, we assume that data points are independent and identically distributed (IID), and that expert predictions for the ith data point are sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution as{a mathematical formula} This assumption allows the experts to be correlated (i.e., {a mathematical formula} Σ K is non-diagonal), as is the case in practice in the aerosol domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given the model parameters Θ , probability of observing the data set {a mathematical formula}D can be written as{a mathematical formula} where subscripts u and l denote unlabeled and labeled parts of the data set, respectively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, we write the joint probability of the data and the model as follows,{a mathematical formula} Note that we defined prior {a mathematical formula}P( Σ − 1) in terms of an inverse of the covariance matrix (i.e., in terms of a precision matrix).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">RMSE is defined as follows,{a mathematical formula} where the sum is over N labeled data points from the test set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Next, we generated the data using two regimes by setting {a mathematical formula}q1=[1,1], {a mathematical formula}q2=[ − 1, − 1], {a mathematical formula} Σ 1=diag([0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5]), {a mathematical formula} Σ 2=diag([0.5,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1]), and we set {a mathematical formula}R=2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This resulted in a labeled data set with {a mathematical formula}N=23,119 data points, where 67% of expert predictions were missing.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Both {a mathematical formula}xi and {a mathematical formula}x ˜ i vectors were always available for all data points.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We used {a mathematical formula}R=1 clusters in both cases, and assumed {a mathematical formula} Σ → ∞ , resulting in an uninformative prior over the AOD values.</a>
