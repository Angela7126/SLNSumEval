<a href="#0" id="0">In the preceding definition, each argument in W has a set of premises containing only one element: a distinguished literal {a mathematical formula}c ∈ C comparing alternatives {a mathematical formula}x,y ∈ X, such that {a mathematical formula}c(x,y) means that “ x is preferred to y ” ; or a literal {a mathematical formula}same_att(x,y) stating that alternatives {a mathematical formula}x,y ∈ X have the same attribute values for each preference criterion provided to the agent.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The following proposition shows that in an epistemic framework built as stated by Definition 5, since the literal {a mathematical formula}better ∉ C, all arguments in the working set are coherent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, to determine which alternatives will be selected from a choice experiment B it is necessary to consider all the decision rules from Γ that are applicable with respect to the justified conclusions that can be inferred from the active arguments of {a mathematical formula}K. The set of acceptable alternatives can be defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By hypothesis, alternatives x and y have the same attributes, therefore a fact {a mathematical formula}same_att(x,y) will belong to evidence set E (Definition 5).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From Definition 5, the evidence set E will contain all the facts of the kind {a mathematical formula}c(x,y) relating alternatives x and y (that belong to the choice experiment posed to the decision maker) with respect to all the preference criteria referred by the distinguished literals in {a mathematical formula}C. In this way, by Proposition 2 and Corollary 1 it will always be possible to activate a primitive argumental structure Σ , warranted in {a mathematical formula}K, such that {a mathematical formula}cl( Σ )=Z with {a mathematical formula}Z ∈ {better(x,y),better(y,x),¬better(x,y),¬better(y,x)}, thus stating a strong preference ( ≻ ) in favor of one of the alternatives.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As mentioned in the analysis of case (i), this is due to the fact that if another criterion with higher priority would exist, for which z is preferred to y, {a mathematical formula} Σ m would not be the last structure in the argumentation line since there would be another one attacking it based on this supposed criterion.When considering cases (i) and (iii) together, it remains to compare {a mathematical formula}cn with {a mathematical formula}cm to determine whether {a mathematical formula}better(x,z) can be warranted; it can be the case that {a mathematical formula}cn=cm, or {a mathematical formula}cn>cm, or {a mathematical formula}cm>cn.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As stated in Section 2, an individual having a rational preference relation ≿ on X, will choose any element of the set {a mathematical formula}C ⁎ (B, ≿ ) when facing a choice experiment {a mathematical formula}B ⊆ X; this is due to the fact of her preference-maximizing behavior.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">To introduce next result, Algorithm 1 will be considered as the function {a mathematical formula} Μ ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) with two arguments: an abstract decision framework and a set of alternatives.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Independently of whether X or {a mathematical formula}Xf is used, a key issue of the decision framework proposed in our work, is that its choice behavior has been formalized with respect to the general theory of choice of Classical Decision Theory and [34] has not.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In our case this is attained by defining the epistemic component of the decision framework as a DAF with particular features on the evidence set (i.e., the working set), the conflict relation, and preference function (see Definition 5 for details), and in [25] this is accomplished by defining ABA frameworks with different properties so that admissible arguments in those frameworks correspond to strongly dominant, dominant, or weakly dominant decisions in the corresponding mapped decision frameworks, in this way, the decisions made exhibit an element of consistency with respect to the accepted arguments in ABA.</a>
