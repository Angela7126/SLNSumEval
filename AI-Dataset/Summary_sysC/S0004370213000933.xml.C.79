<a href="#0" id="0">First, on a subclass of bi-objective MST problem with a strictly convex optimal Pareto front, we find that the expected running time of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecomb,0.5bitwise has the upper bound of{a mathematical formula} By comparing with the previous result for {a mathematical formula}MOEAbitwise[33]{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}MOEArecomb,0.5bitwise appears to be more efficient.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, to obtain the 2-approximation solutions for the general bi-objective MST problem, the expected running time of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecomb,0.5bitwise has the upper bound of{a mathematical formula} which improves the previous result for {a mathematical formula}MOEAbitwise[33]{a mathematical formula} The comparisons imply that recombination operators may help MOEAs in solving real-world multi-objective optimizations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Correspondingly, when the other selected solution is {a mathematical formula}( − 1)n, then {a mathematical formula}p=k − i+k ′ n − 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, in the latter case, {a mathematical formula}p=12(|P| − 1) ⋅ n − k − k ′ n − 1+12(|P| − 1) ⋅ k − i+k ′ n − 1=n − i2(|P| − 1)(n − 1).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By combining these two cases, {a mathematical formula}p=1|P| − 1 ⋅ n − in − 1+(i − 1) ⋅ n − i2(|P| − 1)(n − 1)=(i+1)(n − i)2(|P| − 1)(n − 1), where the factor {a mathematical formula}(i − 1) is because there are {a mathematical formula}i − 1 Pareto optimal solutions in {a mathematical formula}P − {1n,( − 1)n} for selection in the latter case.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Because the crossover probability is {a mathematical formula}12, the number of Pareto optimal solutions increases in one step with probability at least {a mathematical formula}(i+1)(n − i)4(|P| − 1)(n − 1) ⩾ (i+1)(n − i)4(n − 1)2, where the inequality is by {a mathematical formula}|P| ⩽ n from Lemma 2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, the expected steps for a success when starting from a population containing {a mathematical formula}i+1 Pareto optimal solutions is at most {a mathematical formula}4(n − 1)2(i+1)(n − i).Because two offspring solutions need to be evaluated in one reproduction step, the running time of one step is counted as 2.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, the expected running time to find the optimal Pareto front after initialization is at most {a mathematical formula}2 ⋅ ∑ i=1n − 14(n − 1)2(i+1)(n − i), i.e., {a mathematical formula}O(nlnn).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Because the probability of selecting a specific solution is at least {a mathematical formula}1n − 1 by Lemma 2, the number of Pareto optimal solutions increases in one step with probability at least {a mathematical formula}1n − 11n(1 − 1n)n − 1 ⩾ 1en(n − 1).Thus, the expected running time to find the optimal Pareto front after the initialization procedure is at most {a mathematical formula}2en(n − 1)2.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, the probability of selecting {a mathematical formula}T1 for mutation in each iteration is {a mathematical formula} Θ (1), which implies that the expected running time for finding {a mathematical formula}T1 ⁎ is {a mathematical formula}O(m2(lnn+lnw2max)).</a>
