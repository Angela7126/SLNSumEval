<a href="#0" id="0">This is not a real restriction, since knowledge bases only have finitely many formulas in practice, which means that only finitely many certainty levels actually need to be used, and since the semantics of GPL is based on the relative ordering of the certainty degrees, we can then always map these certainty degrees to {a mathematical formula} Λ k for some k. In Section 5, however, we will discuss an extension of GPL in which we can express comparative uncertainty statements, where it will be desirable to allow an unbounded number of certainty degrees at the semantic level.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using Proposition 1, and some well-known properties on necessity and possibility measures, it follows that the following formulas are theorems in GPL:{a mathematical formula} Next is a counterpart to the modus ponens rule in PL (4):{a mathematical formula} To show that this is a theorem in GPL, thanks to Proposition 1, it suffices to note that every necessity measure N satisfying {a mathematical formula}N( Α ) ≥ Λ 1 and {a mathematical formula}N(¬ Α ∨ Β ) ≥ Λ 2 also satisfies {a mathematical formula}N( Β ) ≥ min ⁡ ( Λ 1, Λ 2), which is equivalent to the usual modus ponens in PL, a special case of (4).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To see how (10) can be derived from the axioms of GPL, note that the deduction theorem is valid in GPL, and it thus suffices to show that {a mathematical formula}Nmin ⁡ ( Λ 1, Λ 2)( Β ) can be derived from {a mathematical formula}{N Λ 1( Α ),N Λ 2( Α → Β )}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Starting from this latter set of premises, we apply (W) to obtain {a mathematical formula}Nmin ⁡ ( Λ 1, Λ 2)( Α ) and {a mathematical formula}Nmin ⁡ ( Λ 1, Λ 2)( Α → Β ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Applying modus ponens on axiom (K) and {a mathematical formula}Nmin ⁡ ( Λ 1, Λ 2)( Α → Β ), we obtain {a mathematical formula}Nmin ⁡ ( Λ 1, Λ 2)( Α ) → Nmin ⁡ ( Λ 1, Λ 2)( Β ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Using modus ponens on the latter formula and {a mathematical formula}Nmin ⁡ ( Λ 1, Λ 2)( Α ) we obtain {a mathematical formula}Nmin ⁡ ( Λ 1, Λ 2)( Β ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The following theorem is the counterpart of a hybrid modus ponens rule introduced in [35]:{a mathematical formula} Again a direct proof can be given, using the deduction theorem, by proving {a mathematical formula}N Ν ( Λ 1)(¬ Α ) from {a mathematical formula}N Λ 2( Α → Β ) and {a mathematical formula}N Ν ( Λ 1)(¬ Β ) in the same way (just rewriting {a mathematical formula} Α → Β as {a mathematical formula}¬ Β → ¬ Α ).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, we need to assume {a mathematical formula} Ν ( Λ 1) ≤ Λ 2 in order to weaken {a mathematical formula}N Λ 2( Α → Β ) into {a mathematical formula}N Ν ( Λ 1)( Α → Β ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">And {a mathematical formula} Ν ( Λ 1) ≤ Λ 2 is equivalent to {a mathematical formula}1 − Λ 1+1k ≤ Λ 2, i.e., {a mathematical formula} Λ 2>1 − Λ 1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It turns out that in general, if we restrict our attention to minimally specific Boolean e-models of GPL formulas of this type with {a mathematical formula}k=2, we obtain a semantics for reasoning from the absence of information, which captures the stable model semantics of answer set programs.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">As we shall see the condition {a mathematical formula}k>1 is crucial.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Moreover, as in the proof of Proposition 14, without loss of generality, we can assume that the only meta-literals which occur in this meta-term are of the form {a mathematical formula}N Λ 1( Α 1) and {a mathematical formula} Δ Μ 1( Β 1), by refining any meta-literals of the form {a mathematical formula} Π Λ 1( Α 1) and {a mathematical formula} ∇ Μ 1( Β 1).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Assume that we guess a meta-term of the following form:{a mathematical formula} Using an NP-oracle we can check that this formula is consistent, verifying that {a mathematical formula} Α 1 ∧ ... ∧ Α n is consistent, and that {a mathematical formula} Β i ⊨ Α j whenever {a mathematical formula} Μ i ≥ Ν ( Λ j).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">If the meta-term is consistent, it has a unique least specific e-model {a mathematical formula} Π 1, which is the least specific e-model of {a mathematical formula}N Λ 1( Α 1) ∧ ... ∧ N Λ n( Α n), noting that the latter corresponds to a standard possibilistic logic base.Using the NP-oracle we can check that Β is false in {a mathematical formula} Π 1.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Before we present the proof of the main result, which will apply to arbitrary propositional combinations of comparative certainty statements, we show that the proposed axioms are sufficient for detecting inconsistencies in sets of statements of the form {a mathematical formula} Α ≻ Β .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This is only possible if every e-model Π of Ψ is such that {a mathematical formula} Π ( Α n ∧ Β n)< Π ( Α n ∧ ¬ Β n).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Indeed, suppose there was an e-model Π of Ψ such that {a mathematical formula} Π ( Α n ∧ Β n)= Π ( Α n ∧ ¬ Β n)<1 and define {a mathematical formula} Π ′ as follows ({a mathematical formula}0< Ε <1 − Π ( Α n ∧ Β n)):{a mathematical formula} It is easy to see that if {a mathematical formula} Ε <mini=1n − 1 ⁡ ( Π ( Α i ∧ Β i) − Π ( Α i ∧ ¬ Β i)) it holds that {a mathematical formula} Π ′ is an e-model of {a mathematical formula}c( Α 1| ∼ Β 1) ∧ ... ∧ c( Α n| ∼ Β n).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">If {a mathematical formula} Π ( Α n ∧ Β n)= Π ( Α n ∧ ¬ Β n)=1 we instead define {a mathematical formula} Π ′ as follows ({a mathematical formula}0< Ε < Π ( Α n ∧ ¬ Β n)):{a mathematical formula} Thus we can assume that for every e-model Π of Ψ , we have {a mathematical formula} Π ⊨ cc( Α n| ∼ ¬ Β n).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Given the completeness result from [57] for consistent sets of conditionals, it follows that {a mathematical formula}c( Α n| ∼ ¬ Β n) can be derived from {a mathematical formula}c( Α 1| ∼ Β 1) ∧ ... ∧ c( Α n − 1| ∼ Β n − 1).</a>
