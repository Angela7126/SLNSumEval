<a href="#0" id="0">1 represents average recommendation quality in a content-based recommender system.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since this system does not rely on tags, the quality of recommendations does not vary as the number of tags changes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For a low number of tags, content-based recommendations are better than tag-based, but as tags increase the tag-based system becomes better than content.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We then define and present our approach to learning pseudo-tags from content, which guarantees a tag-based representation for every track in a collection.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Next, we present our novel hybrid representation, which is a dynamic combination of both pseudo-tags and tags.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To evaluate our approach, we then examine both the recommendation quality, and the quality of pseudo-tagging.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, we present our results and conclusions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">A threshold may be set based on the number of tags a query has, and a decision made as to whether or not the track is a cold-start item.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If this threshold is too high however then recommendation quality is hampered by the pseudo-tags; if the threshold is too low then recommendation may still be hampered by a lack of useful tags.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, in a recommender system containing both tag and pseudo-tag representation this introduces a bias; tag-based representations will tend to be similar to other tag-based representation, and pseudo-tag representations with tend to be similar to other pseudo-tag representations.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To test this intuition we evaluate recommendations using differing numbers of pseudo-tags and tags in a combined representation.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Using a leave-n-out strategy on our training set, we evaluate recommendation quality using different numbers of pseudo-tags, and aggregate these results based on how many tags a track has.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To provide a meaningful aggregate, the number of tags each track has is discretized into buckets of 10 tags, for example, all tracks with between 1 and 10 tags are aggregated together.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Using this method of combining pseudo-tags with tags, we are now able to represent every track by a hybrid vector h. For tracks which are well-tagged, the tag vector will be the main contributor to h, and therefore allow recommendation to be made using the strengths of tag representation.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For weakly-tagged tracks, any tags which they have will not be ignored, but instead enhanced by the inclusion of pseudo-tags in h. Recommendations are made using this hybrid representation based on cosine similarity, and will be referred to as Hybrid.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For tracks with a small number of tags, the pseudo-tag representation is given a higher weighting in the hybrid representation, and are allowed to control recommendation.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">To further examine how this dynamic generation of a hybrid representation affects recommendation, we show the results by the number of tags a query has, in Fig.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The reason that Hybrid is able to achieve this higher quality is because of the pseudo-tags that are embedded into the representation.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">These pseudo-tags allow the hybrid approach to have a distinct advantage when less tags are available, instead of reverting to the random recommendations of Tag.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The quality of the PseudoTag method backing up the hybrid approach is illustrated by the dashed black line, and the quality of Content is illustrated by the dashed grey line.</a>
