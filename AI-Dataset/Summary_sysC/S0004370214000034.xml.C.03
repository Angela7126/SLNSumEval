<a href="#1" id="1">To the best of our knowledge, no literature has reported any research that uses a competence model for concept drift detection purposes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Assuming the expectation of parameter {a mathematical formula}wt − 1 will be the same as {a mathematical formula}wt when there is no concept drift, they model the concept drift as a change of parameter vector {a mathematical formula}wt=wt − 1+s, where s is the uncertainty caused by concept drift.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The related closure of {a mathematical formula}c3 is the set of all related sets, with regard to CB, which contain the case {a mathematical formula}c3.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">For any case sample set S, the competence-based empirical weight provides a reference to the degree of case distribution on a competence area represented by A – a sub-set of {a mathematical formula} ℜ CB(CB).</a>
