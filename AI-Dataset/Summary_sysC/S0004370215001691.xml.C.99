<a href="#0" id="0">Indeed, for every model {a mathematical formula}M of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ , {a mathematical formula}M|Var( Φ ) is a model of {a mathematical formula} Φ h.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Further, for every model {a mathematical formula}M of {a mathematical formula} Φ h, the following Boolean interpretation {a mathematical formula}M ′ is a model of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ :{a mathematical formula} We define the preference relation ⪰ over the models of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ as follows: {a mathematical formula}M ⪰ M ′ if and only if {a mathematical formula}M|Var( Φ ) ⪰ Φ sM ′ |Var( Φ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is a Δ -preference relation since its bound function {a mathematical formula} Δ ⪰ Φ ′ can be defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If S is the set of all the Top-1 models of {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ with respect to ⪰ and {a mathematical formula}Var( Φ ), then the {a mathematical formula}S ′ ={M|Var( Φ )|M ∈ S} correspond to the set of all solutions of Φ in Partial MAX-SAT.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Naturally, the models in {a mathematical formula}S ′ are the most preferred models with respect to {a mathematical formula} ⪰ Φ s, and that means they satisfy {a mathematical formula} Φ h and satisfy the maximum number of clauses in {a mathematical formula} Φ s.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The basic idea is simply to use the formula {a mathematical formula} Δ ⪰ Φ (M) associated to a model {a mathematical formula}M to obtain models that are not less preferred than {a mathematical formula}M. This algorithm takes as input a CNF formula Φ , a preference relation ⪰ , a strictly positive integer k, and a set X of propositional variables allowing to define the equivalence relation {a mathematical formula} ≈ X.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The problem of mining Top-k frequent closed patterns in a sequence {a mathematical formula}FCPSmink consists in computing all closed patterns with at least min items such that, for each one, there exist no more than {a mathematical formula}k − 1 closed patterns with at least min items and with supports greater than its support.</a>
