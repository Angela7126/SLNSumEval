<a href="#0" id="0">In our Bayesian model, vendor beliefs take the form of a distribution over buyers' types and the utility of their strategies is determined using the expected response of the buyers to their prices and/or discounts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We outline the Bayesian (expected utility) model in Section 4, and prove that if buyer valuations are independent and identically distributed, and all other vendors use fixed prices, then fixed prices are optimal for any vendor.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each vendor has a fixed cost {a mathematical formula}cj for producing and/or distributing one unit of its product, which is common knowledge among vendors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Once buyers are assigned to specific vendors, the item prices are set by {a mathematical formula}(P,S) as defined above.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For ease of exposition we assume buyers are never indifferent between products (vendors); as such, we assume a predetermined ordering of vendors, specific to each buyer, that is part of its type {a mathematical formula}Vi.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We assume that if buyer i switches from vendor {a mathematical formula}j= Μ (i) in outcome {a mathematical formula}(P,S) to some other vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ , she enjoys the (potentially reduced) price {a mathematical formula}pj ′ (|Sj ′ |+1) induced by her deviation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given an outcome {a mathematical formula}(P,S), the utility of vendor {a mathematical formula}j ∈ M is simply the revenue derived from the buyers assigned to it less the cost of the products sold: {a mathematical formula}Uj(P,S)=|Sj| ⋅ (pj(|Sj|) − cj), where {a mathematical formula}cj is the cost of a single product to j.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The Bayesian (or expected utility) model adopts a standard Bayesian game formulation: vendors have partial information in the form of a commonly-known distribution {a mathematical formula}D over (joint) buyer types, and act to maximize their expected utility, taking expectations over outcomes (SBPs) with respect to possible realizations of buyer types.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The strict uncertainty model assumes that vendors posses even less information about the buyers: they know only the possible set of buyer types (i.e., only the support of the distribution is known).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A game{a mathematical formula}G= 〈 V,C 〉 in the full information model is given by a buyer type matrix {a mathematical formula}V=(vi,j) and vendors costs {a mathematical formula}C=(cj).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the full information model, there is always a fixed price{a mathematical formula}pjthat is a best response for vendor j to any strategy profile{a mathematical formula}P − jof the other vendors.If the vendors have full information, then they know exactly which buyer partitions will form given any profile of discounts P. Suppose that vendor j expects to have t buyers under some nontrivial schedule {a mathematical formula}pj.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Then j can post a fixed price {a mathematical formula}pj=pj(t) and induce identical buyer behavior S.Let {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ =(p − j,pj).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In the Bayesian model we assume that there is some joint distribution over buyers' types {a mathematical formula}D=D(A) which is common knowledge among vendors.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In other words, each buyer's type is distributed according to a common distribution {a mathematical formula}D ˆ (A); and {a mathematical formula}D is the corresponding product distribution.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Note that buyers' valuations are correlated in {a mathematical formula}D. The optimal fixed price is {a mathematical formula}p=2, which guarantees revenue {a mathematical formula}U(p,D)=0.5 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2+0.5 ⋅ 2=3 (two buyers in the first realization and one in the second).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">buyers with distribution{a mathematical formula}D. Let{a mathematical formula}p ⁎ be the optimal fixed price for the vendor.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The best response of j is:{a mathematical formula} Our main result in the Bayesian model is that, assuming buyer types are independent and drawn from the same distribution, a vendor cannot benefit by using a discount schedule instead of a fixed price unless other vendors also use schedules.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Given distribution {a mathematical formula}D ˆ over a single buyer's types (a distribution over vectors of size m), we define the following single parameter distribution {a mathematical formula}D ˆ ′ :{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} ≳ j should be interpreted as > if a buyer of type v prefers vendor j over 1 in case of a tie, and otherwise as ≥ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Thus the revenue of any discount schedule p for the single vendor under distribution {a mathematical formula}D ′ is equal to the revenue it derives using p when faced with vendors posting prices {a mathematical formula}q2, … ,qm under distribution {a mathematical formula}D. One subtle issue is that given pricing {a mathematical formula}p1=p in the multi-vendor game G, there may be several SBPs.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We argue that if discounts are not allowed, then {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is an equilibrium, i.e., that no vendor can earn more than 1 by posting a fixed price.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Similarly, if {a mathematical formula}q<1, then the vendor keeps buyer a for sure, and gains buyer b w.p.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">{a mathematical formula}1 − q.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">It is not hard to verify that the best response of every vendor j to the fixed price {a mathematical formula}p − j=1 is {a mathematical formula}pj=1, even if schedules are allowed (i.e., {a mathematical formula}P=(1,1) is an equilibrium, see Section 6.1).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">{a mathematical formula} Thus the expected revenue {a mathematical formula}maxq ⁡ U(q,D) of the optimal fixed price is at least {a mathematical formula}1n of that of any discount schedule p.We now construct an example that achieves this factor n improvement.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">We can think of event j as representing the level of detail in a product review: when {a mathematical formula}j=n, no buyer knows anything about the product, so all buyers assign it an expected value of 1.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">As j decreases, the review becomes more detailed, providing additional information, so that {a mathematical formula}n − j buyers realize they do not want this product, while expected value of other buyers increase.We define {a mathematical formula}D Ε so that for each {a mathematical formula}j<n the product is of type j with probability {a mathematical formula}qj= Ε n − j.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Note that this can be achieved with the schedule {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ (j)=vj, thus the optimal schedule {a mathematical formula}p ⁎ extracts from any buyer her full expected value:{a mathematical formula} which approaches n as {a mathematical formula} Ε → 0.Suppose instead that the vendor uses a fixed price.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">With any fixed price of the form {a mathematical formula}pj=p ⁎ (j)=vj,j ∈ [n] — clearly there is no reason to use any other price — the vendor will achieve revenue of:{a mathematical formula} Thus for any n, we can set Ε sufficiently small so that the revenue from any fixed price is arbitrarily close to 1, whereas the best discount schedule attracts revenue that approaches n. □</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Once vendors select strategies (prices) P, suppose that the realized buyer types are given by V. This results in the buyer partition {a mathematical formula}S=S(P,V).</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">We define the regret{a mathematical formula}Regj(P,V) of vendor j relative to this outcome to be the difference between the maximum utility it could have achieved by choosing different prices given this type realization (taking other vendor strategies to be fixed) and its utility given its selected strategy:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}P ′ =(pj ′ ,p − j).</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Given their uncertainty about the buyer's types, and without a distribution over these types, we assume vendors assess the utility of a strategy by assuming a type profile realization that maximizes the degree to which that strategy is suboptimal.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">We define the maximum regret of vendor j to be:{a mathematical formula} The goal of each vendor is the selection of a strategy that minimizes its maximum regret given the strategies of other vendors.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">We define the minimax best response of vendor j to strategy profile {a mathematical formula}p − j of its competitors to be:{a mathematical formula} Note that maximum regret is minimized with respect to the types of the buyers, not the actions of other vendors, which are assumed to be known.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">If all vendors use fixed prices{a mathematical formula}P=(p1, … ,pm), and{a mathematical formula}Ais symmetric and independent, then maximum regret for each vendor is realized when all buyers have the same type.We need to show that if {a mathematical formula}r=Regj(P,V) is vendor j's maximum regret, then there is a type {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ ∈ A (which depends on the strategy profile) such that {a mathematical formula}Regj(P,V ⁎ ) ≥ r, where every row in {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ equals to {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ .We break our analysis into two cases.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Suppose first that j's maximum regret is realized by a buyer type profile in which its best response is to ask a lower price than its price {a mathematical formula}pj in P, which by definition must attract more buyers than {a mathematical formula}pj.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Thus in T all buyers select {a mathematical formula}j ′ ≠ j, and {a mathematical formula}|Tj|=0 ≤ |Sj|.Bringing these inequalities together, we have:{a mathematical formula} In other words, regret is maximized in a type profile in which all buyers have identical valuations.The remaining case is when vendor j's regret is maximized under some profile in which its best response {a mathematical formula}pj ′ is to increase its price, potentially losing some buyers, but increasing its margins on those it keeps.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">As a result:{a mathematical formula} On the other hand,{a mathematical formula} Again regret is maximized when all buyers have the same type.We emphasize that the type {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ depends on the profile P, and for every profile there may be a different “ worst-case ” type.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Assume, by way of contradiction, that some discount schedule {a mathematical formula}p=(p(1), … ,p(n)) yields strictly greater revenue than {a mathematical formula}nr ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">We now construct a pricing strategy that yields revenue {a mathematical formula}rn from buyer n. Independently sample {a mathematical formula}n − 1 values from {a mathematical formula}D, simulating the first {a mathematical formula}n − 1 buyers, and sort values so that {a mathematical formula}v1 ≥ ⋯ ≥ vn − 1.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">However, this is exactly the purchase probability and price paid by a single buyer when the proposed price is {a mathematical formula}p(k).</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">We assume that in the middle cell MM both buyers select the same vendor, with equal probability to each vendor.When the maximal distance between prices is no more than 1,{a mathematical formula} Now, suppose that vendor 2 posts the schedule {a mathematical formula}q=(1,0.8).</a>
