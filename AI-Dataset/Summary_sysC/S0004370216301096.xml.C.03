<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}N=[n] be a set of n agents and let {a mathematical formula}A={a1, … ,am} be a set of m items.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consider six agents with the following utilities over the items from the set {a mathematical formula}A={a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6}:{a mathematical formula} Note that Agents 1, 2, and 3 have the same utilities for all the items.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We want to select {a mathematical formula}K=3 items and we use OWA {a mathematical formula} Α =(2,1,0).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The first three agents get utility {a mathematical formula}2×5+4=14 each, the next two get {a mathematical formula}2×5+4=14 each, and the last one gets {a mathematical formula}2×3+1=7.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider a setting with m items and let {a mathematical formula}umax denote the highest utility that some agent gives to an item.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We say that the agents have ( Β , Γ )-non-finicky utilities if every agent has utility at least {a mathematical formula} Β umax for at least Γ m items.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The utilities are as defined below:{a mathematical formula} The agents have {a mathematical formula}(0.8,0.5)-non-finicky utilities.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">These agents have {a mathematical formula}(1, Γ )-non-finicky utilities.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, the total utility of the agents (now applying the OWA operator) is {a mathematical formula}n ∑ i=1p Α i+(3K − n) Α p+1 only if for each agent {a mathematical formula}ei the solution contains p items with utility 1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Consider an input instance with n agents {a mathematical formula}N=[n] and m items {a mathematical formula}A={a1, … ,am}, where we seek a winner set of size K, under OWA {a mathematical formula} Α =( Α 1, … , Α K).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula}K=3 and consider OWA vector {a mathematical formula} Α =(2,1,0).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Agents utilities are set as follows: For each agent e and each item {a mathematical formula}dj, {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ − 2, the utility of e for {a mathematical formula}dj is 1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let S be a solution for {a mathematical formula}I ′ with the utility x.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Thus the utility that i gets from {a mathematical formula}W ⁎ under Α is {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1K Α iui ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let {a mathematical formula}K=3 and let the OWA vector be {a mathematical formula} Α =(2,1,0).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We have {a mathematical formula} ℓ =2 nonzero entries in Α .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We treat the agents utilities as {a mathematical formula}(0.8,0.5)-non-finicky ones.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">{a mathematical formula} The algorithm outputs set {a mathematical formula}S={a1,a3,a4}.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">So there must exist at least {a mathematical formula}1 ℓ ( ℓ n − ℓ nexp ⁡ ( − Γ K ℓ )) occurrences of the items whose utilities are taken with coefficient {a mathematical formula} Α 1.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Thus each such an agent assigns to each such an item utility at least equal to {a mathematical formula} Β umax.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">For every Ε we show a polynomial-time algorithm with approximation ratio {a mathematical formula}(1 − Ε ).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">For each instance I of Α -OWA-Winner where we seek winner set of size at least {a mathematical formula}K Ε , we run the algorithm from Theorem 29.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The agents in the set {a mathematical formula}NE have the following preference orders.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Further, the utility of each agent from {a mathematical formula}NE will increase.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Altogether, both agents get utility at least {a mathematical formula}x(K+4).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Again, both agents get utility at least {a mathematical formula}x(K+4).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Thus the total utility of the agents in {a mathematical formula}NE in the optimal solution must be at least {a mathematical formula}nx(K+4).</a>
