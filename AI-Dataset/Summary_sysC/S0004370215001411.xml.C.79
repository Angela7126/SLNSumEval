<a href="#0" id="0">However, for {a mathematical formula}I={s0}, as considered in this paper, where only a subset of S is reachable from {a mathematical formula}s0, we cannot guarantee that all states are updated infinitely often, and therefore Theorem 2.9 cannot be directly employed to prove the convergence of RTDP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, in order to prove the convergence of RTDP with {a mathematical formula}I={s0}, we have to guarantee that asynchronous DP is performed for the set of relevant states (Definition 2.7).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that the maximization {a mathematical formula}maxp → ∈ Ka in Equation (21) is performed by applying the MaxParameterOut operation on a PADD, i.e., by calling a nonlinear solver to maximize each PADD leaf, which results in an ADD (this operation corresponds to choosing the worst model for an abstract state and action pair).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to sample the next state, three different methods are considered for choosing a value for each probability parameter {a mathematical formula}pi, subject to a set of constraints Φ : (1) the use of the same parameter values computed in the Bellman update called minimax_parameter_choice; (2) computing a random legal parameter value at each step during the trial called rand_parameter_choice; (3) computing a predefined legal parameter value only once called predefined_parameter_choice.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After having chosen the values for {a mathematical formula}p → , with one of the three sampling methods, we can finally carry out the sampling of the next state as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}P( ⋅ |s,a) is completely known, i.e., all the probability parameters, {a mathematical formula}p → , are known.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Convergence of RTDP-IP with different methods for sampling the next stateIn an SSP MDP-IP, repeated RTDP-IP trials eventually yield optimal values over all relevant states if: (i) the initial value function is admissible, i.e.,{a mathematical formula}V0(s) ≤ V ⁎ (s), ∀ s ∈ Sand (ii) the method of choosing a probability distribution{a mathematical formula}P( ⋅ |s,a) ∈ K( ⋅ |s,a)to sample the next state guarantees choosing{a mathematical formula}P( ⋅ |s,a) ∈ K( ⋅ |s,a)such that{a mathematical formula}P(s ′ |s,a) ≠ 0for any{a mathematical formula}s ′ ∈ S.</a>
