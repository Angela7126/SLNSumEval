<a href="#0" id="0">This change in focus entails two interconnected principles: a hierarchical structure to integrate the actor ʼ s deliberation functions, and continual online planning and reasoning throughout the acting process.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, explicit models of these devices are often needed in the actor ʼ s deliberations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our actor may use several planning and decision-making techniques as well as other computational tools, both before and while acting.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Section 3 develops open problems from the actor ʼ s viewpoint in knowledge representation, model acquisition and verification, synthesis and refinement, and monitoring and hierarchical integration; and Section 4 concludes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">An actor is the integrated hierarchy of deliberation components with their enablers: for example, Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">At a very high level, the whole operational management of the harbor can be described as a simple plan of abstract actions (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Both the refinement and adaptation mechanisms can be designed through an approach based on our vision, where the HOM facility is an actor that can be organized into a hierarchy of reasoning functions, where each abstract action can be a task to be further refined and planned for, and where online planning and acting are performed continually in order to adapt and repair plans.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">At this abstract level, automated planning techniques should hold the stage.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that both types of models need to take into account the actor ʼ s environment.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The relationships between the operational and descriptive specifications of an actor ʼ s models cover several open problems.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Different planning and acting problems may require different kinds of models of the same environment.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The acquisition of descriptive and operational models of an actor is a critical issue that can determine the feasibility, the effectiveness, and the correctness of automated acting and planning techniques.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Learning descriptive models of actions and skills is an active area of research, e.g., [112], [61], [66], [110], [111], in which many challenges remain to address in the integrative actor ʼ s requirements.</a>
