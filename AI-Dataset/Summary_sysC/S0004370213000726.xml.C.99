<a href="#0" id="0">Using the second condition from Definition 2.5 it corresponds to the fact that {a mathematical formula}x¯i,j is a unit implicate of {a mathematical formula} Φ P under partial assignment given by {a mathematical formula}D(X) if and only if {a mathematical formula}xi,j is forced to 0 by unit propagation on {a mathematical formula} Φ P under this partial assignment.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula} Ψ = Φ ∧ ¬C and Π be a resolution refutation of Ψ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Because C is not 1-provable for Φ it holds that {a mathematical formula} Ψ ⊬ 1 ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then according to the proposition there is a clause {a mathematical formula}C Ψ ∈ Π which is both empowering and 1-provable with respect to Ψ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We consider a clause {a mathematical formula}C Φ =C Ψ ∨ C.First, {a mathematical formula}C Φ is 1-provable for Φ because {a mathematical formula}C Ψ is 1-provable for Ψ and all the possibly required literals were added to {a mathematical formula}C Φ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It follows from the following obvious chain of equivalence:{a mathematical formula}Let ℓ be an empowering literal of {a mathematical formula}C Ψ for Ψ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then ℓ is trivially also an empowered literal of {a mathematical formula}C Φ for Φ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The required properties for unit resolution and entailment come from the definitions of {a mathematical formula}C Φ and Ψ using similar chain of equivalences as in 1.Thus {a mathematical formula}C Φ is the desired clause since it is both empowering and 1-provable with respect to Φ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">we can derive contradiction from {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ by using only unit resolution.Due to the nature of unit resolutions, we can assume that the unit refutation proceeds in two phases.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the first phase we take all unit clauses from {a mathematical formula}¬C Φ and perform unit resolutions only over the variables from {a mathematical formula}C Φ .In the second phase we continue with refutation proof without using unit clauses from {a mathematical formula}¬C Φ and we do not resolve over variables from {a mathematical formula}C Φ at all.Let us now assume that</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}D1 ′ , … ,Dm ′ = ⊥ is a unit refutation proof which proceeds in the above two phases.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Since it is a unit refutation proof, it can be observed that {a mathematical formula}m ⩽ s.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let us assume that the first phase is formed by clauses {a mathematical formula}D1 ′ , … ,Dk ′ − 1 ′ and the second phase is formed by clauses {a mathematical formula}Dk ′ ′ , … ,Dm ′ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Each clause among {a mathematical formula}D1 ′ , … ,Dk ′ − 1 ′ is therefore either a clause in {a mathematical formula} Φ ′ or it originates from two preceding clauses by unit resolution over variable from {a mathematical formula}C Φ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Similarly each clause among {a mathematical formula}Dk ′ ′ , … ,Dm ′ is either an original clause from Φ or it originates from two preceding clauses by unit resolution over a variable which is not in {a mathematical formula}C Φ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">It is enough to construct a tied chain of length n. The following formula (for given n) contains such a chain:{a mathematical formula} Clearly both the number of variables and the number of clauses are linear in n. First, let us observe that {a mathematical formula}(A1 ∨ A2 ∨ ⋯ ∨ An ∨ z) is an empowering implicate with empowered literal z.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This is because by falsifying all literals {a mathematical formula}A1, … ,An we get a quadratic formula which has z as a unit implicate, but unit resolution cannot derive this fact.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Since the only tied chain in {a mathematical formula} Φ n is composed by all the n clauses in {a mathematical formula} Φ n, by Lemma 3.9 we need all these clauses in order to derive an empowering implicate.</a>
