<a href="#0" id="0">In our model, the learner and the teacher interact as follows.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First of all, a situation is presented to both of them.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, the learner and the teacher try to produce an utterance that refers to one of the objects in the situation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">At the beginning, since the learner does not have any knowledge about the language, it will not be able to produce any utterance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As soon as enough data has been provided, the learner will start to construct its own grammar and will attempt to produce appropriate utterances (i.e., it learns in an incremental way the language it is exposed to).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The teacher can either produce a correction of the learner's utterance or produce a random denoting utterance for the given situation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, both the teacher and the learner engage in comprehension and production of utterances which are intended to be appropriate to their shared situation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The learning task is characterized by a meaning transducer, a process that produces situations, and the behavior of the teacher.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The goal of the learner is to learn a grammar for the language that will enable it to produce all and only the denoting utterances for any given situation.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{sup:1}</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For example, early in one run of learning with {a mathematical formula}M1, the learner translated the teacher's utterance el cuadrado rojo into the following sequence of lists of predicate symbols:{a mathematical formula} In the reduced implication graph at that point, no predicate symbols were associated with the word el, the two predicate symbols gr1 and sq1 were associated with the word cuadrado and the predicate symbol re1 was associated with the word rojo.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The resulting set S of sequences of predicate symbols is then compared with the situation to try to determine the teacher's meaning.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In particular, the learner computes a variable-normalized representative of every meaning that is both supported by the situation and is such that its sequence of predicate symbols is in S – these become the learner's guess of the possible meanings of the teacher's utterance in the given situation.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To continue the preceding example, in the interaction in question, the situation consisted of a big red square above a big blue circle.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Thus, the meaning {a mathematical formula}(sq1(x1),re1(x1)) is both supported by the situation and has one of the two predicate sequences in S, namely, {a mathematical formula}(sq1,re1).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This is the only possible meaning that the learner guesses for this utterance because there is no supported meaning with the predicate sequence {a mathematical formula}(gr1,re1), and no other inequivalent supported meaning with the predicate sequence {a mathematical formula}(sq1,re1).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">To facilitate the “ aging out ” of incorrect general forms that are acquired early in the learner's experience, the learner records the interaction number of the most recent teacher utterance with a unique possible meaning that matched the general form.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">These values are used in the learner's production process in such a way that general forms that are not repeatedly matched to teacher utterances become less and less likely to be used by the learner.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The process used by the teacher to analyze the learner's utterance is as follows.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">If the learner's utterance is equal to one of the correct denoting utterances for the situation, the teacher classifies the learner's utterance as correct.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">If the learner's utterance is not correct, the teacher “ translates ” the learner's utterance into a sequence of predicates by using the adult meaning transducer for the language.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">In particular, each word for which there is a non-empty output in the transducer is replaced by the predicate from one such output.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">For example, the teacher translates the incorrect learner utterance el elipse pequeno into the predicate sequence {a mathematical formula}(el1,sm1) despite the errors of agreement in the utterance.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">In more detail, the teacher's transducer has no output for el, has an output of el1 for elipse, and an output of sm1 for pequeno, which yields the indicated teacher translation of the incorrect utterance.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">If the resulting sequence of predicates is the same as the sequence of predicates in at least one meaning obtained from a correct denoting utterance, the learner's utterance is classified as having an error in form.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">In this case, the learner is judged to have chosen a correct meaning but an incorrect form to express that meaning.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The goal of the teacher is to choose a possible correction with the same meaning as that intended by the learner.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">A possible correction is chosen by the teacher by considering the set of denoting utterances whose meanings have the same sequence of predicates and choosing one such utterance using a measure of similarity to the learner's utterance.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">For example, if {a mathematical formula}(el1,sm1) corresponds to a denoting utterance for the situation, the teacher may choose la elipse pequena as a possible correction for el elipse pequeno.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">If the learner's utterance is not correct and its corresponding sequence of predicates is not equal to the sequence of predicates for any denoting utterance for the situation, the teacher uses a measure of similarity between the sequence of predicates for the learner's utterance and the sequences of predicates corresponding to denoting utterances for the situation to determine whether there is a “ close enough ” match between the predicate sequences, determined by a threshold on a weighted edit distance on the sequences.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">If so, the teacher classifies the learner's utterance as having an error in meaning and chooses as the possible correction a denoting utterance whose predicate sequence is judged “ most similar ” to the predicate sequence for the learner's utterance.</a>
