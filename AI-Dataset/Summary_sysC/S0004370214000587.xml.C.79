<a href="#0" id="0">Lovett, Forbus and Usher [51] describe a model that extracts qualitative spatial representations from visually segmented representations of RPM problem inputs and then uses the analogy technique of structure mapping to find solutions and, where needed to achieve better analogies, to regroup or re-segment the initial inputs to form new problem representations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The formula our present implementation uses to calculate the colorimetric contraction is:{a mathematical formula} where the colorMean of a region is the average of all colorimetric information available in that region, taking into account the multivariate nature of the underlying image as previously discussed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One method for solving this puzzle is this: from this set of candidates, we may form the fractal representations from the fractal encoding of the transformation of each candidate image X in terms of image C.{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} This provides a set of possible transformations, which we shall label Ω , from which to seek the most analogous transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ and thereby find which candidate image was responsible for it.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this example, the problem is to determine for which of the candidate images the transformation {a mathematical formula}T ′ is made most analogous to transformation T. We first will represent T as a fractal representation, and then generate a set of candidate transformations Ω as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For our example, this involves the calculation of a set of similarity values {a mathematical formula} Θ i for each answer {a mathematical formula}Ai:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}S(X,Y) is the Tversky similarity between two sets X and Y, and {a mathematical formula}H(Ai) and {a mathematical formula}V(Ai) denote the relationship formed when the answer image {a mathematical formula}Ai is included.</a>
