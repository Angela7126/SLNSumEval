<a href="#0" id="0">The Main Track is the most popular track of each SAT competition.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In total 28 solvers (solver versions) developed by 18 different groups participated in the 2015 SAT Race.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Except for CBPeneLoPe each solver had at least one version participating in the Main Track.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First we randomly selected 3 out of the top 7 solvers from the previous competition (participants of the Sequential and Application {a mathematical formula}SAT+UNSAT Tracks of the SAT Competition 2014).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We ran the selected solvers on all the benchmarks (newly submitted and 2014 SAT Competition) with a 1 hour time limit.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Three prizes were given out to the top three solvers (solving the highest number of instances) and a fourth (special) prize to the “ most innovative ” solver.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The special prize was selected by a ranking method that uses the number of solved instances not solved by the top three solvers of the track.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Each solver received for each instance it solved:</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The hardest 100 instances of the 300 instances selected for the Main Track (see Section 4.2) were used as benchmarks for the Parallel Track.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The hardness is defined in Section 4.2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Eleven solvers (solver versions) participated in the Parallel Track.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The list of participating solvers is displayed in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In the 2015 SAT Race we introduced a new track for solvers supporting interactive incremental SAT solving – the Incremental Library Track (ILT).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The ILT differs significantly from all the other (traditional) tracks of the SAT competitions in the following aspects:</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A benchmark for the ILT is an application (and inputs for it) that uses SAT solvers interactively.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The input of the Essentials application is CNF Boolean formulas – same as SAT solvers.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Table 2 shows the ranking of the solvers of the competition's Main Track.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The ranking is based on the number of solved instances regardless of the satisfiability status.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Thanks to the fact, that we performed five runs of each solver on each benchmark in the Main Track we can now analyze the difference in the performance of the solvers across these five runs.</a>
