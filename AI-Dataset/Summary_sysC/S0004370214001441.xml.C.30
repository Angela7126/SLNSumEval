<a href="#0" id="0">AntiunificationAn antiunification of two terms {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Ψ 2, {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 ⊓ Ψ 2, is a term that subsumes both, such that there is no more specific term that also subsumes both:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given two terms {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Ψ 2, which have n and m variables respectively, we know that there is at least one antiunification with at most {a mathematical formula}n×m variables, which subsumes {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1 with a mapping {a mathematical formula}m1 and {a mathematical formula} Ψ 2 with a mapping {a mathematical formula}m2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">7 shows an illustration of this process, with two terms: {a mathematical formula} Ψ 1, with 4 variables, and {a mathematical formula} Ψ 2 with 5 variables.</a>
