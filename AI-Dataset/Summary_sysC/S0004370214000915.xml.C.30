<a href="#0" id="0">Given an MCS M and a set R of bridge rules (that are compatible with M), we denote by {a mathematical formula}M[R] the MCS obtained from M by replacing its set of bridge rules {a mathematical formula}br(M) with R; e.g., {a mathematical formula}M[br(M)]=M and {a mathematical formula}M[ ∅ ] is M with no bridge rules.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By {a mathematical formula}M ⊨ ⊥ we denote that M has no equilibrium, i.e., is inconsistent, and by {a mathematical formula}M ⊭ ⊥ the opposite.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given an MCS M, a diagnosis of M is a pair {a mathematical formula}(D1,D2), {a mathematical formula}D1,D2 ⊆ br(M), such that {a mathematical formula}M[br(M) ∖ D1 ∪ cf(D2)] ⊭ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By notation, {a mathematical formula}D±(M) is the set of all diagnoses.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given an MCS M, {a mathematical formula}Dm±(M) is the set of all pointwise subset-minimal diagnoses of an MCS M, i.e.,{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Given an MCS M, an inconsistency explanation of M is a pair {a mathematical formula}(E1,E2) of sets {a mathematical formula}E1,E2 ⊆ br(M) of bridge rules, such that for all {a mathematical formula}(R1,R2) where {a mathematical formula}E1 ⊆ R1 ⊆ br(M) and {a mathematical formula}R2 ⊆ br(M) ∖ E2, it holds that {a mathematical formula}M[R1 ∪ cf(R2)] ⊨ ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By {a mathematical formula}E±(M) we denote the set of all inconsistency explanations of M, and by {a mathematical formula}Em±(M) the set of all pointwise subset-minimal ones.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The intuition about {a mathematical formula}E1 is as follows: bridge rules in {a mathematical formula}E1 are crucial to create an inconsistency in M (i.e., {a mathematical formula}M[E1] ⊨ ⊥ ), moreover this inconsistency is relevant for M in the sense that adding some bridge rules from {a mathematical formula}br(M) to {a mathematical formula}M[E1] never yields a consistent system, i.e., {a mathematical formula}M[E1 ∪ R] ⊨ ⊥ for all {a mathematical formula}R ⊆ br(M).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The inconsistency of P does not matter for {a mathematical formula}P ′ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In terms of MCS, a set of bridge rules may create an inconsistency that is irrelevant if the system is consistent when more or all bridge rules are present.</a>
