<a href="#0" id="0">Single-stage decision, i.e., decisions which do not consider future requests: In this case, at decision epoch 1 zone 1 server will be assigned to the demand element 2 and zone 2 server will be assigned to the demand element 1, i.e., {a mathematical formula}x121=1,x211=1 and rest all variables as 0.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This will give a total revenue of {a mathematical formula}20+14.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As none of the servers will be available at decision epoch 2, no other requests can be served.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Multi-stage decision, i.e., decisions which consider future requests: In this case, at decision epoch 1, zone 1 server will be assigned to the demand element 1 and zone 2 server will not serve any request, i.e., {a mathematical formula}x111=1 and rest all variables for decision epoch 1 are set to 0.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">At decision epoch 2 both servers will be available in the zone 2 and can serve both requests, i.e., {a mathematical formula}x212=1 and {a mathematical formula}x222=1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This will give a total revenue of {a mathematical formula}15+15+10=40.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If zone i server is assigned to the request between zone pairs {a mathematical formula}<Zi,Zi> then the variable {a mathematical formula}xi is true else if it is assigned to the request between zone pairs {a mathematical formula}<Zi,Zi â€² > then {a mathematical formula}xi is false.</a>
