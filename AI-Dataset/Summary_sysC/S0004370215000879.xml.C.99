<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:5} We show also that in the factorized cascade model (i.e., when the observation probabilities are the products of terms depending on either the slot or the ads, as used in [24]), any non-randomized learning mechanism that is dominant-strategy truthful (even in expectation w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">the click realizations) has a regret of {a mathematical formula} Θ (T) even in the special case in which only the ad-dependent parameters are unknown (while it is an open problem whether it is possible to obtain a better upper bound adopting a randomized mechanism and truthfulness in expectation w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By analyzing the difference between the payments of the VCG and A-VCG1, we notice that during the exploration phase the regret is {a mathematical formula}O( Τ K) (e.g., if all the ads allocated into the K slots are clicked at each explorative step), while during the exploitation phase the error in estimating the qualities sum over all the K slots, thus suggesting a linear dependency on K for this phase as well.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Nonetheless, as K increases, the number of samples available per-ad increases as {a mathematical formula} Τ K/N, thus improving the accuracy of the quality estimates by {a mathematical formula}O ˜ (K − 12) (see Proposition 1).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While the proof of Theorem 2 could exploit the specific definition of the payments for position-dependent slots and it is a fairly simple extension of [20], in this case the proof is more complicated because of the dependency of the cumulative probabilities of observation on the actual allocations and decomposes the regret of the exploitation phase in components due to the different allocations ({a mathematical formula}f ˜ instead of {a mathematical formula}f ⁎ ) and the different qualities as well ({a mathematical formula}q ˜ i+ instead of {a mathematical formula}qi).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Using the mechanism described before, it is possible to derive an upper-bound over the cumulative regret over the SW of the allocation (as in [23]).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{sup:17} In particular, the theoretical bounds reveal the dependency of (expected) regret on characteristic parameters of the auction (i.e., T, N, K, and {a mathematical formula}qmin, and Μ if the mechanism is randomized).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">First we notice that adopting the value of the parameters identified in Theorem 14 we obtain an upper bound {a mathematical formula}O ˜ (T23) for the global regret {a mathematical formula}RTSW.In order to find values that better optimize the bound over {a mathematical formula}RTSW, it is possible to use the procedure followed in the proof of Theorem 3 with {a mathematical formula}e:=1 Γ min:{a mathematical formula} □</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We start computing the per-step regret over the SW during the exploitation phase.First of all we introduce the following definition: {a mathematical formula}S ′ ={s ′ |s ′ ∈ {0,1}N, Π (i;f ⁎ (v ˆ )) ≤ K ⇒ si ′ =1}, i.e., the set of the random realization where the cSRP does not modify the bids of the ads displayed when the allocation function is {a mathematical formula}f ⁎ is applied to the true bids {a mathematical formula}v ˆ .We now provide the bound over the regret.</a>
