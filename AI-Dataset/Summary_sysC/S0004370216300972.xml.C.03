<a href="#4" id="4">We have that {a mathematical formula} Δ +(H,9)=2 and {a mathematical formula}bp+(H,9)=14.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This algorithm traverses the functions {a mathematical formula}hj and {a mathematical formula}Hj.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The execution of Algorithm 3 on variable {a mathematical formula}x1 in the problem of Example 3 is as follows.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">4 shows how the functions {a mathematical formula}hj and {a mathematical formula}Hj are traversed.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The domain of {a mathematical formula}x1 after the execution of Algorithm 4 is thus {a mathematical formula}[1,4].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then {a mathematical formula}gj is injective.</a>
