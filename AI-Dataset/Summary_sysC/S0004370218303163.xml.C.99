<a href="#0" id="0">In this document we propose a new approach to this problem, based on the initial hypothesis that abductive reasoning properly accounts for the human ability to identify and characterize the patterns appearing in a time series.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The result of this interpretation is a set of conjectures in the form of observations, organized into an abstraction hierarchy and explaining what has been observed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An abstraction pattern represents a set of constraints that must be satisfied by some evidence in order to be interpreted as the hypothetical observation of a certain process, together with an observation procedure providing a set of measurements for the features of the conjectured observation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The knowledge of the domain is described as a set of abstraction patterns as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}h Ψ (Ah,Thb,The) is an observable of the domain playing the role of a hypothesis on the observation of an underlying process Ψ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">According to the definition, an abstraction pattern is defined over a fixed set of evidence findings {a mathematical formula}MP.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In general, however, an abstraction involves an undetermined number of pieces of evidence – in the case of an ECG wave, the number of samples.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, we provide a procedure for dynamically generating abstraction patterns, based on the theory of formal languages.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}PGh gathers the set of abstraction patterns that share the same observable h as a hypothesis; thus, these represent the different ways to conjecture h. Using this method, the application of every production incrementally adds a new observable as a finding and a set of constraints between this finding and previous entities, as follows:</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that in terms of the {a mathematical formula}{N,V} symbols the {a mathematical formula}GVB grammar is syntactically equivalent to the regular expression {a mathematical formula}NV(NV)+.In this example, as in 3.5, an observation procedure {a mathematical formula} Θ P is not necessary, since the constraints in the grammar completely determine the temporal endpoints of the hypothesis and there are no more attributes to be valued.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Informally, an interpretation problem arises from the availability of a set of initial observations from a given system, and of domain knowledge formalized as a set {a mathematical formula}G={Gq1, … ,Gqn} of {a mathematical formula}Gap grammars.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In contrast, in the present framework all the observations have the same status, and the objective of the interpretation process is to provide an interpretation of what is observed at the highest possible abstraction level in terms of the underlying processes.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As we will see later, some observables may stand out amongst others regarding the efficiency of the interpretation process, as salient features that can draw some sort of perceptual attention.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As discussed above, any observable {a mathematical formula}q ∈ QP can appear multiple times as different pieces of evidence for an abstraction pattern P, in the form of findings collected in the set {a mathematical formula}MP.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As a consequence, P can predict multiple observations of the set {a mathematical formula}O for a given observable {a mathematical formula}q ∈ QP, each of these corresponding to one of the findings of the set {a mathematical formula}MP through a matching relation.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A matching relation makes an assignment of a set of observations to a set of findings of a certain pattern, leading us to understand the interpretation problem as a search within the available evidence for a valid assignment for the constraints represented in an abstraction pattern.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">From the notion of matching relation we can design a mechanism for abductively interpreting a subset of observations in {a mathematical formula}O through the use of abstraction patterns.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Thus, a matching relation for a given pattern allows us to hypothesize new observations from previous ones, and to iteratively incorporate new evidence into the interpretation by means of a hypothesize-and-test cycle.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">These conditions entail: (1) an abstraction hypothesis guesses an observation of the observable hypothesized by the pattern; (2) a new observation is obtained from the application of the observation procedure to those observations being assigned to the set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP by the matching relation; and (3) the observations taking part in an abstraction hypothesis must satisfy those constraints of the pattern whose variables are assigned a value by the observations.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">An abstraction hypothesis defines in the set of observations {a mathematical formula}O a counterpart of the subsets {a mathematical formula}AP and {a mathematical formula}EP of the set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP of a pattern P, resulting from the selection of a set of observations {a mathematical formula}O Ħ ⊆ O by means of a matching relation, satisfying those requirements shown in the Definition 11.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">↢ provides a valid assignment, since the set of observations satisfying {a mathematical formula} Θ P=true also satisfies the constraints in {a mathematical formula}CP.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Since each abstraction hypothesis involves a different abstraction pattern there are no alternative hypotheses in any interpretation of {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S).Suppose there is a set covering {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ S of U of size k or less.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">For all {a mathematical formula}u ∈ U there exists {a mathematical formula}ci ∈ C − { ∅ } such that {a mathematical formula}u ∈ ci and, by the above construction, there exists {a mathematical formula} Ħ i ∈ I such that {a mathematical formula}abstracted_by(ohi)={u ∈ codomain( ↢ Ħ i)}={u ∈ ci}=ci, and therefore, {an inline-figure}.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">That is, the set of abstraction hypotheses I is an exclusive cover of the interpretation problem {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) of size k or less.Following the same reasoning as for the set covering optimization problem, finding a minimal and a exclusive cover of an interpretation problem {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) is NP-hard, since we can use the solution of this problem to check whether there is an exclusive cover of the interpretation problem of size k or less, and this has been proven above to be NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The answer to this question takes the form of a hypothesize-and-test cycle: if the attention focuses on an observation, then an abstraction hypothesis explaining this observation should be generated (hypothesize); however, if the attention focuses on a finding predicted by some hypothesis, an observation should be sought to match such finding (test).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Thus, the interpretation problem is solved by a reasoning strategy that progresses incrementally over time, coping with new evidence through the dynamic generation of abstraction patterns from a finite number of abstraction grammars, and bounding the theoretical complexity by a parsimony criterion.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">The observation procedure of the generated pattern is denoted as {a mathematical formula}Tw_delin(), and may be any of the methods described in the literature for the delineation of T waves, such as in [26].In addition to the {a mathematical formula}Pwave pattern generated by {a mathematical formula}Gw and detailed in Example 3.4, {a mathematical formula}GN and {a mathematical formula}GTw generate the following abstraction patterns:{a mathematical formula}Finally, let {a mathematical formula}O={o1wave= 〈 qwave, ∅ ,0.300,0.403 〉 ,o2wave= 〈 qwave, ∅ ,0.463, {a mathematical formula}0.549 〉 ,oPw= 〈 qPw, ∅ ,0.300,0.403 〉 ,oQRS= 〈 qQRS, ∅ ,0.463,0.549 〉 } be a set of initial observations including a P wave and a QRS complex abstracting two wave observations located at specific time points.Given this interpretation problem, Fig.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">It is applied when the attention is focused on an observation that can be abstracted by some abstraction pattern, producing a new observation at a higher level of abstraction.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The result of ABDUCE() is a set of interpretations {a mathematical formula}I ′ , each one adding a new abstraction hypothesis with respect to the parent interpretation I.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Then, for each grammar, each production including the corresponding observable {a mathematical formula}q(oi) (line 4) initializes an abstraction pattern with a single finding of this observable (line 5), and a new hypothesis is conjectured with a matching relation involving both the observation under focus and the finding (line 6).</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">A list structure {a mathematical formula}L Ħ and two additional variables {a mathematical formula}B Ħ and {a mathematical formula}E Ħ are initialized to trace the sequence of productions used to generate the findings in the abstraction pattern; these will play an important role in subsequent reasoning steps (line 7).</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">According to Algorithm 2, the ABDUCE() function is used to move forward the interpretation, since the focus of attention points to an observation {a mathematical formula}oPw.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">The abstraction pattern that supports this operation is {a mathematical formula}PN, and a matching relation is established with the {a mathematical formula}mPw finding.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">As a result, the following hypothesis is generated:{a mathematical formula}Fig.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">The key point is that this deduction process follows an iterative procedure, as the corresponding abstraction pattern is dynamically generated from the grammar.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Hence the DEDUCE() function aims to extend a partial matching relation by providing the next finding to be tested, as part of the test step of the hypothesize-and-test cycle.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Since the first finding leading to conjecture {a mathematical formula}oh does not necessarily appear at the beginning of the grammar description, the corresponding abstraction pattern will not, in general, be generated incrementally from the first production of the grammar.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">The SUBSUME() function explores the set of observations {a mathematical formula}O and selects those consistent with the constraints on the finding in the focus of attention (line 3), expanding the matching relation of the corresponding hypothesis in different descendant interpretations (line 4).</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">To move on, we can apply the SUBSUME() function, establishing the matching relation {a mathematical formula}{mQRS ′ ↢ oQRS}.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">This leads to the {a mathematical formula}I7 interpretation, in which the uncertainty on the {a mathematical formula}oTw observation is reduced; however, the evidence for the {a mathematical formula}PTw pattern is not yet complete.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">In this last step, the {a mathematical formula}Pwave pattern can be applied to observe the deviation in the raw ECG signal, generating the {a mathematical formula}o3wave observation and completing the necessary evidence for the {a mathematical formula}oTw observation and thus also for {a mathematical formula}oN.</a>
