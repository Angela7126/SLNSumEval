<a href="#0" id="0">This may be explained by the fact that the wine space contains only 330 entities (making the problem of inducing a 100-dimensional conceptual space under-constrained), the fact that {a mathematical formula}Twine contains fewer candidate terms than {a mathematical formula}Tplace and {a mathematical formula}Tmovie (potentially leading to fewer interpretable directions in the space), and the fact that we have less text, on average, per wine than per film of place type.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Table 16, we indeed find that the difference between {a mathematical formula}SVMMDS and the FOIL based methods is most pronounced for the keywords, which tend to refer to very specific properties.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Closer inspection of the results revealed that the relative performance of {a mathematical formula}FOIL1, compared to {a mathematical formula}SVMMDS, is best for keywords that refer to common movie themes (e.g.</a>
