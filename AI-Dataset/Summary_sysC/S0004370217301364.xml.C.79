<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula} It is immediate to check that everything discussed above with respect to the original set of AICs also applies to its normalized counterpart, i.e., intuitively, these constraints represent the same knowledge and the sets of repairs and weak repairs remain unchanged.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The shift of l with respect to S is defined as{a mathematical formula} The shift function is extended to sets of literals, update actions and AICs in the straightforward manner.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To see that this operator is well-defined (i.e., that the result of applying it indeed yields a consistent set of actions), observe that the syntactic restrictions on AICs guarantee that the set {a mathematical formula}{head(r)|r ∈ Η ∧ U(DB) ⊨ body(r)} is always consistent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This means that there exists a set {a mathematical formula}V ⊊ U such that {a mathematical formula}T Η (V) ∩ U ⊆ V.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From the definition of {a mathematical formula}T Η it follows immediately that, if r is a rule such that {a mathematical formula}V(DB) ⊨ body(r), then {a mathematical formula}head(r) ∉ (U ∖ V), whence {a mathematical formula}U is not a grounded repair for {a mathematical formula} 〈 DB, Η 〉 .Conversely, assume that {a mathematical formula}U is a strictly grounded fixpoint of {a mathematical formula}T Η and let {a mathematical formula}V be any subset of {a mathematical formula}U such that there is no rule r for which {a mathematical formula}V(DB) ⊨ body(r) and {a mathematical formula}head(r) ∈ (U ∖ V).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">From the definition of {a mathematical formula}T Η , it then follows that{a mathematical formula} i.e., that{a mathematical formula}Similarly, we also find that{a mathematical formula} and the result follows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In our translation of AICs to logic programs, namely in Theorem 7.6, we assume that {a mathematical formula}DB= ∅ and that the only update actions that occur in heads of rules are positive, i.e., of the form +a.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In turn, the two last computations can be done in polynomial time: they require evaluating each literal in the body of each rule from Η with head Α or {a mathematical formula} Α D and computing its truth value under the database updated by {a mathematical formula}U.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given a set of update actions {a mathematical formula}U, checking that it is a fixpoint of {a mathematical formula}T Η can be done in polynomial time on the size of DB and Η , as shown in Proposition 8.1; the NP-oracle can then answer whether there exists {a mathematical formula}U ′ ⊊ U with {a mathematical formula}T Η (U ′ ) ∩ U ⊆ U ′ , thereby establishing whether {a mathematical formula}U is grounded.</a>
