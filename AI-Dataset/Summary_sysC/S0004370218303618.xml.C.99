<a href="#0" id="0">Following the interpretation of support as necessity, such conflicts are handled in [46] by characterizing the notion of extended defeat, which reinforces the acceptability constraints presented in Section 2: given an attack {a mathematical formula}A ⟶ B and a sequence of necessary supports {a mathematical formula}B ⟹ … ⟹ C, there is an extended defeat from {a mathematical formula}A to {a mathematical formula}C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that since the support relation {a mathematical formula}S is defined so that the source of a support link in an ASAF is an argument (by Definition 11, {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ A×(A ∪ R ∪ S)), all elements in a support sequence but the last one (i.e., the {a mathematical formula}Ai in Definition 15) will be arguments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore note that, as expressed by the condition {a mathematical formula}X ∈ (A ∪ R ∪ S) in Definition 15, this does not prevent the last element in a support sequence from being an argument as well.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For instance, in Definition 15, Definition 18, S denotes a set of supports of an ASAF (i.e.,{a mathematical formula}S ⊆ S).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In contrast, in Definition 19, S is used to denote a set of arguments, attacks and/or supports of an ASAF (i.e.,{a mathematical formula}S ⊆ A ∪ R ∪ S).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">On the other hand, recall that the support relation of the ASAF follows a necessity interpretation, thus establishing constraints on the elements it relates.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given a support {a mathematical formula} Β =(B,Y), the constraint relating {a mathematical formula}B and Y can be seen (and satisfied) from two points of view.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The translation incorporates the arguments {a mathematical formula} Β + and {a mathematical formula} Β − in the associated AFN, which are used for encoding the positive and negative constraints.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In order to prove this equivalence, we will use some intermediate results, showing the relationship between the semantic notions characterized directly on the ASAF, and those corresponding to its associated AF.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As mentioned before, we will use the prefix ‘ D ’ to distinguish the semantic notions corresponding to an AF (in this case, the AF associated with an ASAF) from those corresponding to the ASAF.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The intermediate results developed in this section will be used later for proving the equivalence between the approach proposed in Section 4 for obtaining the complete, preferred, stable and grounded extensions of the ASAF and the one given in [29].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Specifically, we will show that the complete, preferred, stable, and grounded extensions of the ASAF after applying the corresponding mapping function (respectively, {a mathematical formula}Map or {a mathematical formula}D-Map) coincide with the D-complete, D-preferred, D-stable, and D-grounded extensions of its associated AF.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Thus, in some cases, we will start by assuming that the set of elements of the associated AF (respectively, of the ASAF) under analysis is a D-complete (respectively, complete) extension.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The following lemma formalizes the fact that applying the mapping function {a mathematical formula}Map( ⋅ ) to a complete extension of an ASAF leads to a D-conflict-free set of arguments from its associated AF.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The preceding theorems show that, given an ASAF Δ and its associated AF{a mathematical formula} Δ AF, for each extension {a mathematical formula}E of Δ under a given semantics {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ {complete, preferred, stable, grounded}, there exists a corresponding extension in {a mathematical formula} Δ AF; conversely, for each extension {a mathematical formula}E ′ of {a mathematical formula} Δ AF under a semantics D- Σ there exists a corresponding extension in Δ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Given a scenario where a support {a mathematical formula} Α =(A,B) holds but the chosen semantics Σ cannot determine whether the positive or the negative constraint associated with Α holds, the translation proposed in [29] is such that neither {a mathematical formula} Α + nor {a mathematical formula} Α − would belong to the corresponding extension of the associated AF under the semantics Σ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In contrast, the translation given in Definition 23 is such that, in cases like the one mentioned above, neither {a mathematical formula} Α + nor {a mathematical formula} Α − would belong to the corresponding extension of the associated AF; notwithstanding this, argument Α would belong to that extension.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">That is, differently from before, argument Β belongs to the grounded extension meaning that, even though the attack cycle between arguments {a mathematical formula}A and {a mathematical formula}B is not resolved by the grounded semantics, the support Β holds.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Notwithstanding this, it should be remarked that we do not regard the translation given in [29] as incorrect; rather, we believe the translation given in Definition 23 is more fine-grained, allowing to explicitly distinguish between cases where a support Β is not included in an extension of the ASAF because it does not hold, from cases where it was not included in the extension (using the translation of [29]) because the chosen semantics was not able to determine whether the positive or the negative constraint associated with Β held.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">As a result, by incorporating this distinction into the translation given in Definition 23, as shown in Section 5, the two approaches for the acceptability calculus of the ASAF are equivalent.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">As pointed out in [29], the ASAF relates to other approaches in abstract argumentation that account for the existence of a support relation, like the Bipolar Argumentation Framework (BAF) [23], the Evidential Argumentation System (EAS) [47], the meta-argumentation approach for representing deductive support proposed in [57] and the Argumentation Framework with Necessities (AFN) [46].</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Given a support sequence {a mathematical formula}[B, … ,C], the AFN is such that there is also a necessary support from {a mathematical formula}B to every element in the sequence (in particular, to {a mathematical formula}C).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In the ASAF, given the support sequence {a mathematical formula}[B, … ,C], by Proposition 5 the acceptability constraints derived from each support link in the sequence are combined to establish the fact that the acceptability of {a mathematical formula}C implies the acceptability of {a mathematical formula}B (equivalently, the non-acceptability of {a mathematical formula}B implies the non-acceptability of {a mathematical formula}C), thus capturing the behavior of the necessary support link from {a mathematical formula}B to {a mathematical formula}C in the AFN.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Given this translation, the grounded extension of the associated AF is {a mathematical formula}{D, Δ }, meaning that the only active interaction is Δ , leaving Β outside because it is not grounded.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">In particular, argument {a mathematical formula}NB Β — which expresses “ the support Β is not grounded ” — does not belong to the grounded extension either.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">This is because of the attack cycle between arguments {a mathematical formula}A and {a mathematical formula}B, which is not resolved by the grounded semantics.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">As a result, argument Β — expressing that “ the support Β is active ” — and argument {a mathematical formula}N Β C — expressing that “ the support Β is valid but not grounded ” — do not belong to the grounded extension either.</a>
