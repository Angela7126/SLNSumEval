<a href="#0" id="0">The Top-k SAT problem consists in computing a set {a mathematical formula}L of Top-k models of Φ with respect to ⪰ and X satisfying the two following properties:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In other words, at each step of the enumeration process, a Δ -preference relation allows us to generate a formula from the current found model to force the algorithm to enumerate the models that are not less preferred.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The basic idea is simply to use the formula {a mathematical formula} Δ ⪰ Φ (M) associated to a model {a mathematical formula}M to obtain models that are not less preferred than {a mathematical formula}M. This algorithm takes as input a CNF formula Φ , a preference relation ⪰ , a strictly positive integer k, and a set X of propositional variables allowing to define the equivalence relation {a mathematical formula} ≈ X.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It consists in computing a Top-k solution for an instance {a mathematical formula}T=( Φ h, ⪰ Φ s,Var( Φ h ∧ Φ s),k) where {a mathematical formula} Φ h ∧ Φ s is a Partial MAX-SAT instance ({a mathematical formula} Φ h and {a mathematical formula} Φ s are the hard part and the soft part respectively) and {a mathematical formula} ⪰ Φ s is the preference relation defined in Section 3.1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The problem of mining Top-k frequent closed patterns in a sequence {a mathematical formula}FCPSmink consists in computing all closed patterns with at least min items such that, for each one, there exist no more than {a mathematical formula}k − 1 closed patterns with at least min items and with supports greater than its support.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">the previous constraints, for obtaining a closed frequent pattern:{a mathematical formula} Intuitively, the previous constraint maximizes the number of symbols different from wildcard on the right side of the symbol represented by the propositional variable having 0 as index.</a>
