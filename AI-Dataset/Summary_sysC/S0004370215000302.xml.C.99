<a href="#0" id="0">The main contribution of this article is twofold: (1) computationally, we develop efficient optimization algorithms for both continuous and discrete formulations, of which the key step is a projection with two coupled constraints; (2) statistically, we show that the proposed continuous model reconstructs the oracle estimator.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, consistent feature selection and parameter estimation are achieved simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that (6) has an identical form of the constrained sparse group lasso problem:{a mathematical formula} except that x is restricted to the two support sets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Theorem 1 gives an analytical solution of {a mathematical formula}x ⁎ in an ideal situation when the values of {a mathematical formula} Λ ⁎ and {a mathematical formula} Η ⁎ are given.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Unfortunately, this is not the case and the values of {a mathematical formula} Λ ⁎ and {a mathematical formula} Η ⁎ need to be computed directly from (8).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If only the cardinality constraint is present, the optimal solution of Problem(18)can be obtained by setting the{a mathematical formula}p − s1smallest (in absolute value) elements of v to zero.</a>
