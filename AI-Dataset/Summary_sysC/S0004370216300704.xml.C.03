<a href="#1" id="1">All values of {a mathematical formula}Ai need to be considered so that we can use the same set of conditions {a mathematical formula}D for all derivatives with respect to {a mathematical formula}Ai at a certain reference example.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, let {a mathematical formula}Ai be a five-valued attribute with values {a mathematical formula}v1 to {a mathematical formula}v5.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To induce a qualitative model with respect to a certain attribute {a mathematical formula}Ai, we first compute the PDQ PD for the entire learning set: for each example, we compute the set of dependent values {a mathematical formula}D and find the total ordering of attribute values {a mathematical formula}Ai as explained in the previous two sections.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We used Qube to calculate {a mathematical formula}@survived=1@treatment for each learning example in the original data set.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}S=no âˆ§ L=yes: Ball L is blocking the left rail-first shot which makes both direct shots preferred over the rail-first shots.</a>
