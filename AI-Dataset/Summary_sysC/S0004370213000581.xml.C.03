<a href="#0" id="0">In addition to the bag-level classification function {a mathematical formula}F(X), many methods try to learn an instance-level classification function {a mathematical formula}f(x → i) that operates directly on the instances {a mathematical formula}x → i.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Throughout this work we will use uppercase to refer to bags X and to the bag-level classifier F, and we will use lowercase to refer to instances {a mathematical formula}x → and to the instance-level classifier f.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, the discriminative learning process occurs at this level: a discriminative instance-level classifier {a mathematical formula}f(x → ) is trained to separate the instances in positive bags from those in negative ones (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that the ES paradigm is also based on global, bag-level information, in the sense that the bag X is represented by a feature vector {a mathematical formula}v → that summarizes the relevant information about the whole bag.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is an ES method where each bag X is explicitly mapped into a vector {a mathematical formula}v → .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, in order to perform this mapping, the bag X is compared with other bags Y from the training set through the definition of a bag-level distance function {a mathematical formula}D(X,Y).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This way, the bag X is classified as positive if any of its instances {a mathematical formula}x → ∈ X belongs to class 1, and classified as negative otherwise.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In order to estimate the instance-level classifier {a mathematical formula}f(x → ), the methods of this category use a training set of instances where each instance inherits the label of the bag where it lies.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This distance will be low if there is some instance in Y that belongs to a class that is similar to the one of {a mathematical formula}x → .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Based on this, a bag X is represented by a histogram {a mathematical formula}v → that counts how many instances from X fall into each cluster.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The latter methods classify the instances into two classes {a mathematical formula}C={C+,C − }, where {a mathematical formula}C+ denotes the set of positive instances and {a mathematical formula}C − the set of negative instances.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The IS methods classify the bag X as positive if any of its instances belongs to {a mathematical formula}C+, so that we can express the bag-level classifier as {a mathematical formula}F(X)=[ Δ (X,C+)>0], where {a mathematical formula}[.]</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This classifier {a mathematical formula}f(x → ) is in turn used by the IS methods for classifying the instances into either {a mathematical formula}C+ or {a mathematical formula}C − .</a>
