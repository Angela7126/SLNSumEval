<a href="#0" id="0">We study the game induced among vendors and buyers and use the term price competition game to refer to it.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This can be thought of as a two stage game.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">At a first stage, the strategy of each vendor is its price.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">At a second stage, the buyers respond to these prices as described above.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The utility of vendor j, when the vendors use a price vector p and the buyers are assigned to vendors according to an assignment x that is consistent to p, is defined as{a mathematical formula} Vendors are utility-maximizers.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A price vector p and a consistent assignment x form a (pure Nash) equilibrium when for every vendor j, the price {a mathematical formula}pj maximizes the utility {a mathematical formula}uj(y,(pj ′ ,p − j)) among all prices {a mathematical formula}pj ′ ≥ cj and all assignments y that are consistent to {a mathematical formula}(pj ′ ,p − j).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Here, the notation {a mathematical formula}(pj ′ ,p − j) is used to represent the price vector where all vendors besides j use the prices in p and vendor j has deviated to price {a mathematical formula}pj ′ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Consider a price competition game with n buyer types and one vendor with a production cost of 0.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider the price competition game {a mathematical formula}G shown in Table 2.Let x be the assignment where all buyers of type A are assigned to vendor 1, all buyers of type B are assigned to vendor 4, buyers of type C are assigned to 2, buyers of type D are assigned to vendor 1 and, finally, buyers of type E are assigned to vendor 3.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This leads to the following price vector {a mathematical formula}p={0,0,0,1}.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In order to verify that {a mathematical formula}(x,p) is indeed a pure Nash equilibrium, it suffices to run algorithm Verify with input {a mathematical formula}(x,p); this is true since all buyers are assigned to vendors in their demand set, vendors 1, 2 and 3 cannot increase their utility by unilaterally increasing their price as, then, they would lose all assigned buyers, while vendor 4 cannot increase its price, since its assigned buyers would move to vendor 1, and cannot attract new buyers by decreasing its price.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In the following, we restrict ourselves to optimal assignments and show tight bounds on the cost of subsidies that are necessary and sufficient to enforce these assignments as equilibria.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Consider an optimal assignment x with {a mathematical formula}xij ∈ {0, Μ i} for every buyer type/vendor pair and the price vector p with {a mathematical formula}pj=cj; clearly, x is consistent to p. By deviating to any other price, vendor j cannot get any buyers that are not assigned to it in the optimal assignment; it can, however, increase its utility by raising the price for those buyers that are already assigned to it.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence, it suffices to assign a subsidy of {a mathematical formula}sj(x,p)= ∑ ixij(vij − cj) to each vendor j; this obviously yields a total amount of subsidies equal to {a mathematical formula}SW ⁎ that enforces the optimal assignment as an equilibrium, since each vendor obtains the maximum utility from its assigned buyers.For the lower bound, let {a mathematical formula} Χ >2 and consider the price competition game with two buyer types of unit volume and valuations Χ and 1 for a single vendor of production cost of 0.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The optimal social welfare is {a mathematical formula}SW ⁎ = Χ +1.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Observe that the utility of the vendor is maximized to Χ by setting its price to Χ while any price that is consistent to assigning both buyer types to the vendor is at most 1 for a vendor utility of at most 2.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Hence, the amount of subsidies required to enforce the optimal assignment as an equilibrium is at least {a mathematical formula} Χ − 2 which becomes at least {a mathematical formula}(1 − Ε )SW ⁎ by setting Χ sufficiently large.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Consider the price competition game in the proof of Lemma 4; we repeat it in Table 4.Consider the allocation x where all buyers of type ℓ are assigned to vendor ℓ and all buyers of type r are assigned to vendor r. By applying algorithm CandidatePrice, we obtain the price vector {a mathematical formula}p=(5,5) and the corresponding subsidy vector {a mathematical formula}s(x,p)=(1,1); this amount of subsidies is required so that no vendor has incentive to lower the price to {a mathematical formula}3 − Ε and obtain all buyers and a utility of {a mathematical formula}6 − 2 Ε .</a>
