<a href="#0" id="0">The “ best-shot ” public goods game is a network game, defined on a social network.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The simple version of the public goods game (PGG) has a fixed utility for a player who has at least a single neighbor buying the good.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Players in the general version of PGG have additional utility when multiple neighbors purchase the good.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Most previous studies of equilibria of the PGG [7], [14], [15], [8] dealt with the simplified version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the simplified version the costs for taking the action are equal for all players (i.e., {a mathematical formula} ∀ i ∈ N,Ci=C) and the number of public goods that each player can benefit from accessing to is limited to 1 (i.e., {a mathematical formula}K=1).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In such a case, the utility of player i for some outcome {a mathematical formula}v ∈ V1× … ×Vn can be simplified to:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In order to show that PGG is an ordinal potential game, one must provide a global potential function and then prove that the properties of the global potential function (as given in Equation (5)) hold.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We term such a potential function as viable.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consider a global function of the form{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Φ i(v) denotes the share of player i in the global potential function in outcome v. An intuitive and simple version of {a mathematical formula} Φ i(v) was proposed for the simplified version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game in a former paper [8]:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Better-response dynamics for the “ best-shot ” public goods game converges in at most{a mathematical formula}2 ⋅ K ⋅ n2improvement steps.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the extended scenario each player is endowed with the ability to propose a payoff transfer at each step, in response to a neighbor's proposal of her better response.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For the simple version of the PGG where {a mathematical formula}K=1, it is shown next that the players' ability to propose payoff transfers enables the extended version of better-response dynamics to converge to a stable state of greater (or equal) efficiency than that of the initial, not necessarily stable, outcome.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">When the extended better-response dynamics is applied to the general version of PGG ({a mathematical formula}K ≥ 2), there is no such theoretical guarantee for the efficiency.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In a “ best-shot ” public goods game a player i has an incentive to compensate its neighbor j only in case player j benefits from deviation from its strategy T. In this case j's deviation (from strategy T to F) affects i's utility, and the payoff loss incurred to player i is 1 (according to Equation (2)).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, the utility loss of player i, termed {a mathematical formula} ℓ i, which can be thought of as the maximal payment (i.e., transfer of payoff) that player i may be willing to sacrifice in order to convince player j to stay with strategy T is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Algorithm 2, below, is an extended version of Algorithm 1 that handles the general version of the “ best-shot ” public goods game.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The main difference between the algorithms is that for the general version of PGG there is no guarantee regarding the improvement of the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Nevertheless, the experimental evaluation of Section 7 demonstrates that in practice Algorithm 2 yields stable outcomes of greater efficiency than that of the initial outcome.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The lack of theoretical guarantees regarding the efficiency of the outcomes stems from the fact that according to Algorithm 1 each player may secure a transfer of payoffs to at most one of its neighbors.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">This observation does not hold in the general case when {a mathematical formula}K>1.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Similarly to the simple version, Algorithm 2 terminates when a pass through all the players of the game does not yield any changes to the players' strategies.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Note that according to Algorithm 2, transfers of payoffs should only be proposed to players with {a mathematical formula}statei(v)=Tl ≥ K.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Example 2</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Reconsider the outcome {a mathematical formula}v ⁎ of Example 1 as yielded by Algorithm 2 (Fig.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The second set of experiments studies how do the parameters of the problem (i.e., the number of players N, the value of {a mathematical formula}K and the average number of neighbors m) influence the performance of the two methods.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">The third set of experiments studies the impact of the order of the players on the resulting outcome.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">However, for general PGGs with {a mathematical formula}K=3 the improvement in social welfare obtained by Algorithm 2 is quite close to that of the best PNEs (Fig.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">7 depicts the improvement in social welfare of the outcomes yielded by both methods on large random networks.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">When {a mathematical formula}K=1, the proposed method produces outcomes which about 5% higher social welfare improvement than those provided by better-response dynamics (Fig.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">When {a mathematical formula}K=3, the results of the proposed method are approximately 16% more efficient than those of better-response dynamics (Fig.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Note that in this case better-response dynamics yields outcomes that are {a mathematical formula} ≈ 1% − 2% less efficient than the initial outcome.</a>
