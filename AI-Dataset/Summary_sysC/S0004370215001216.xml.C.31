<a href="#0" id="0">We can define the symmetry class of any point {a mathematical formula}x ∈ x as the set of the images {a mathematical formula}s(x) for all the symmetries s of the problem.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the case of variable symmetries, it can be noted {a mathematical formula}x Σ ={x Σ : Σ ∈ Σ }.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Provided that the domain satisfy the symmetries, i.e.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}x=x Σ for all {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ Σ , being in the same class is an equivalence relation and thus the symmetry classes form a partition of x.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A geometric interpretation of lex constraints highlights their complexity and indicates the intuition behind the relaxation we propose in the next section.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let us denote {a mathematical formula}L Σ (x) (resp.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}L Σ (x)) the solution set of a lex constraint breaking a symmetry Σ (resp.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">a whole symmetry group Σ ) on a domain x, i.e.,{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} For convenience, we will omit the domain x when it spans the whole set of real vectors {a mathematical formula}Rn.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Proposition 1</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}lex Σ (x) ⟹ rlex Σ (x).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Similarly to what we have done for lex constraints, we define the portions of a domain x satisfying rlex constraints as{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} For convenience, we will omit the domain x when it spans the whole set of real vectors {a mathematical formula}Rn.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The number of {a mathematical formula}fd Σ constraints is by essence equal to the number of symmetries Σ in the considered symmetry group, i.e., up to factorial, while there is no obvious simplification of this intractable set of constraint;</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The variable ordering underlying the considered lexicographic order also impacts the set of generated rlex, not only in the name of the involved variables but even in cardinality.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For instance, consider the symmetry group generated by compositions of {a mathematical formula} Σ =[2,1,4,5,6,3].</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">It is composed of two synchronized cyclic symmetries, one on the first two variables, the other one on the last four variables.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The two corresponding rlex constraints obtained with the standard variable order are {a mathematical formula}x1 ≤ x2 and {a mathematical formula}x3 ≤ x5.</a>
