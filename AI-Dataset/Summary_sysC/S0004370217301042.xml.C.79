<a href="#0" id="0">We assume the quality criterion for a plan Π to be its length {a mathematical formula}| Π |, that is a plan Π is optimal iff it contains the minimal number of actions among all plans solving {a mathematical formula}M. Nevertheless, all techniques presented in this article are easily modified for a quality criterion based on the (non-negative) cost of actions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to find a plan, the MADLA Planner searches through a state-space (where states are {a mathematical formula}s ⊆ P) induced by the input multi-agent planning problem, driven by a pair of a projected (local) heuristic and a distributed (global) heuristic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The novel search scheme we are proposing combines the local and distributed heuristics in a manner inspired by the classical multi-heuristic search [10], but modified to be suitable for similar (or as in our case the same) heuristics which differ only in that one is computed on the projected problem and the other one on the global problem using a distributed algorithm.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If node u was expanded by a public action, a message {a mathematical formula}MSTATE is sent to all other agents, containing the public projection {a mathematical formula}s ▷ pub of state s together with the private unique identifiers representing the private parts of all agents, its {a mathematical formula}u.g, its heuristic value {a mathematical formula}u.h and a parameter d determining whether it was evaluated using the local or distributed heuristic in order to determine to which open list it should be added.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The “ plan found ” message {a mathematical formula}MPLANFOUND (with no parameters, except for the implicit sender {a mathematical formula} Α j) is sent by an agent {a mathematical formula} Α j when it reaches a goal state to inform other agents that it has found a plan and it is starting the plan reconstruction process.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The plan reconstruction message {a mathematical formula}MRECONSTRUCT= 〈 s ▷ pub, Δ i,t, Α k 〉 contains the state s (represented as {a mathematical formula}s ▷ pub and the private unique identifier {a mathematical formula} Δ i of the receiving agent), from which the reconstruction should continue, a discrete time-point t, initially set to {a mathematical formula}u.g of the last search node u (that is, the search node which satisfied the goal condition) and the agent {a mathematical formula} Α k which started the plan reconstruction.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The relaxed plan {a mathematical formula} Π j,iRE+ is maintained by {a mathematical formula} Α j throughout the whole computation of the heuristic estimate for the agent {a mathematical formula} Α i and a single state s, so that each action of {a mathematical formula} Α j is counted at most once.</a>
