<a href="#2" id="2">Recall that the ranking of the benchmarks in the benchmark pool was done using a small set of SAT solvers that were known to perform well in the previous competitions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The fact that this solver was one of the five solvers used for the ranking of the benchmarks suggested a possible bias towards the reference solvers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Also worth noting is that all portfolio solvers are heavily using the MPhaseSAT solver from the 2011 SAT Competition added as a reference solver.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Here we address the question What is a minimum set of solvers that would solve all instances solved by any solver within a track?</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We ran the two best performing SLS solvers Sparrow2011 and sattime2011 from the 2011 SAT Competition on a set of 19 randomly generated k â€“ SAT instances for {a mathematical formula}k=3,5,7, executing each solver four times on the same instance using different seeds.</a>
