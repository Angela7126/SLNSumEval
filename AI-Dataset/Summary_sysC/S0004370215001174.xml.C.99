<a href="#0" id="0">This is not in contrast with robotics experiments, but the latter are more often used to measure the performance of a system's components to solve a specific problem rather than the entire system.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">RoCKIn@Home is the most similar competition to RoboCup@Home, and its significant focus on benchmarking, that includes a different evaluation methodology and a deeper analysis of the interaction between functionalities and tasks, is certainly of great interest to RoboCup@Home.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As discussed further in Section 6.2, the ideas of multiple repetitions of a test for better statistical analysis and a new scoring system for a detailed analysis of the relation between functionality and task performance come directly from observations of the RoCKIn@Home competition.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the design of the tests and in the analysis of the results, we consider the above overall goal of RoboCup@Home and the conventions limiting the difficulties of the environment.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, advances of RoboCup@Home are measured in terms of the effectiveness of the robotic systems (tested during the competition) in performing tasks and services that are relevant for helping non-expert users in daily activities in a domestic scenario, taking into account the discussed limitations of the difficulty of the environment.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The evaluation of the difficulty or the complexity of a task is thus an important feature for our analysis.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Some studies have measured task complexity [15] and two main classes of approaches have been considered: subjective methods, where the difficulty of a task is measured by involving users who are asked to accomplish the task, and objective methods, where such features as the number of components and the relationship between them are identified and measured.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Some of these methods require the task to be actually executed to measure its complexity.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Person Tracking difficulty was increased in 2012 by increasing the amount of background noise in the ‘ Follow me ’ test, allowing many people within the area were the test was performed, thus increasing the difficulty for the robot to track the walker.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As a final remark on the developed analysis, we want to highlight that in the development of integrated research in AI and robotics, a good balance of all the functionalities is required.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Naturally, we focus on the top performing teams as well as on the teams that successfully demonstrated a particularly interesting approach or a very robust approach for a particular skill.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As shown in the analysis reported in the previous section and in the description of the proposed solutions below, the changes in the competition rules enabled teams to address specific solutions to the problems in different years.</a>
