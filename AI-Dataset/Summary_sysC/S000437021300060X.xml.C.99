<a href="#0" id="0">This allows us to show, for instance, that System {a mathematical formula}A is sound and complete for the inference of arbitrary CI statements from sets of saturated CI statements relative to both the class of all binary probability measures and the class of all discrete probability measures.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let {a mathematical formula}I(A,B|C) be a CI statement, and let {a mathematical formula}F ∈ F be a real-valued function such that {a mathematical formula} ⊨ FaI(A,B|C).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that {a mathematical formula} Δ F(V)=0, for each {a mathematical formula}V ∈ L(A,B|C).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The proof goes by downward induction on {a mathematical formula}L(A,B|C).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By Proposition 7, we have {a mathematical formula}L(A,B|C)= ⋃ W ∈ W(I(A,B|C))[C,W¯].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence, for the base case, we must prove that {a mathematical formula} Δ F(W¯)=0, for each {a mathematical formula}W ∈ W(A,B|C).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}W={a,b} ∈ W(I(A,B|C)), with {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A and {a mathematical formula}b ∈ B.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Now, {a mathematical formula}I(a,b|C ∪ (A − {a}) ∪ (B − {b})) is derivable from {a mathematical formula}I(A,B|C) using weak union and symmetry.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Furthermore, {a mathematical formula}I(a,b|W¯) is derivable from {a mathematical formula}I(a,b|C ∪ (A − {a}) ∪ (B − {b})) using strong union, since {a mathematical formula}C ∪ (A − {a}) ∪ (B − {b}) ⊆ W¯.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Thus, {a mathematical formula}{I(A,B|C)} ⊢ II(a,b|W¯), and, hence, by the soundness of {a mathematical formula}I, {a mathematical formula}{I(A,B|C)} ⊨ FaI(a,b|W¯).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since {a mathematical formula} ⊨ FaI(A,B|C), it follows that {a mathematical formula} ⊨ FaI(a,b|W¯).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Because {a mathematical formula}L(a,b|W¯)={W¯}, we can invoke Proposition 22 to conclude that {a mathematical formula} Δ F(W¯)=0.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For the inductive step, let {a mathematical formula}V ∈ L(A,B|C).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The inductive hypothesis states that {a mathematical formula} Δ F(U)=0 for all {a mathematical formula}U ∈ L(A,B|C) that are strict supersets of V. Similar to the base case, we can infer that {a mathematical formula} ⊨ FaI(A ′ ,B ′ |V) with {a mathematical formula}A ′ =A − V,B ′ =B − V, and V pairwise disjoint.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Hence, by Proposition 22, {a mathematical formula} ∑ U ∈ L(A ′ ,B ′ |V) Δ F(U)=0 (1).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Clearly, {a mathematical formula}L(A ′ ,B ′ |V) ⊆ L(A,B|C).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Also, all sets in {a mathematical formula}L(A ′ ,B ′ |V) are supersets of V. Hence, by the inductive hypothesis, (1) reduces to {a mathematical formula} Δ F(V)=0.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">{a mathematical formula}(2) ⇒ (3).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Let {a mathematical formula}C be a set of CI statements and c a single a CI statement for which {a mathematical formula}C ⊢ c.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Let {a mathematical formula}F ∈ F for which {a mathematical formula} ⊨ FaC.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Since {a mathematical formula}F has the zero-density property, we have that, for each {a mathematical formula}U ∈ L(C), {a mathematical formula} Δ F(U)=0.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">By Theorem 11, {a mathematical formula}C ⊢ c implies {a mathematical formula}L(c) ⊆ L(C).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Hence, by Property 22, {a mathematical formula} ⊨ Fac.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">{a mathematical formula}(3) ⇒ (1).</a>
