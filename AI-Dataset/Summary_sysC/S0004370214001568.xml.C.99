<a href="#0" id="0">The necessary components of a collaborative intelligence are nearly at hand, and the key issues readily identified.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a first step, this paper proposes three challenging but accessible problems that would both change the public perception of artificial intelligence and spur substantive research to advance our science.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Their premise was that “ every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. ” There is no indication in that document that computers were to work together with people; the intent was to develop an autonomous intelligence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The Dartmouth manifesto postulated general goals: to discover “ how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. ” There was no mention of interaction with or impact on people, and no targets beyond the things that people can do.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">“ Learn ” and “ model ” now clearly dominate, with techniques (e.g., “ plan, ” “ gener, ” “ search, ” “ constraint, ” “ logic, ” and “ network ” ) as important concerns, along with “ game, ” “ social, ” and “ data. ” This is how we, as researchers, now describe our field to one another.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The earliest instance of this appears to have been the push to prove all the theorems in Principia Mathematica, a feat ultimately accomplished independently by both Gilmore and Wang [9], [30].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since then, prize money and targeted research funding have engendered enthusiastic competitions in such areas as speech recognition, game playing, and self-driving cars, where work might have otherwise developed far more slowly.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As a result, AI's standard for success has become the ability of one system, algorithm, architecture, representation, or approach to outperform another.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">AI researchers soon recognized that to solve the “ kinds of problems now reserved for humans ” would require a substantive knowledge base and a host of ways to use it [16].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As engineers produced computers that could store vast quantities of data and process it quickly, the data-driven paradigm arose: what intelligence requires is enough facts.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">If people are to trust an artificial intelligence, we will want to know not only what is true but also why, that is, what is the source of the machine's premises and the pattern of its reasoning.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Facts should have provenance (e.g., as in Start [12]) and rationales should be transparent to human users.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As envisioned here, a collaborative intelligence (CI) partners with a person to achieve the person's goals.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Given an ontology of tasks and their components, the computer would assume that any new conversation is a request for help, and seek to elicit from the person some clarification of the task at hand, including the person's goals and relevant constraints.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Their dialogue requirements, user models, and knowledge requirements are increasingly more complex.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Thus approaches from the simplest one, such as appropriate responses to emotion and detection of changed goals, will remain useful for subsequent CIs.</a>
