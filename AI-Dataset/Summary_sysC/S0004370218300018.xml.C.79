<a href="#0" id="0">As well-known, {a mathematical formula}SROIQ-RL knowledge bases can be expressed in first-order (FO) logic [26], where every axiom {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ L Σ is translated into an equivalent FO sentence {a mathematical formula} ∀ x. Φ Α (x) where x contains all free variables of {a mathematical formula} Φ Α depending on the type of the axiom (see below).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To this end, we let S consist of (a) all positive atomic assertions Β such that {a mathematical formula}I ˆ (x) ⊨ Β where {a mathematical formula}I ˆ K( Χ , Ν )=(M ˆ ,I ˆ , Χ ), and Β is over N, where N are the constants of the named part,{sup:13} and (b) all negative atomic assertions ¬ Β over N such that {a mathematical formula}I ˆ K Β ,c( Χ , Ν ) does not exist (i.e., no CAS-model {a mathematical formula}ICAS= 〈 M ′ ,I ′ , Χ 〉 with name assignment Ν exists such that {a mathematical formula}I ′ (x) ⊨ Β ).It is easy to see that S is satisfiable, and it follows from the proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 that S is moreover a clashing set for {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ,e 〉 iff some clashing set {a mathematical formula}S 〈 Α ,e 〉 {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ,e 〉 exists, and that S includes some irredundant (minimal) clashing set {a mathematical formula}S ′ of size linear in the size of Α ; thus we can restrict the candidates Β resp.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the other hand, if the global knowledge {a mathematical formula}G contains no defeasible axioms, then the guess for a justified CAS-model {a mathematical formula}ICASN in which the query Q has no match in the proof sketch can be eliminated, and following the arguments in the proof of Proposition 10 a single such candidate {a mathematical formula}ICASN can be constructed in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this section, we introduce a normal form for axioms that allows us to represent a CKR {a mathematical formula}K conveniently as facts of a datalog program, as it bounds the number of concept and role constructors to a single application in each axiom.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, he presented – exploiting a normal form of axioms – a fixed datalog program that gives a universal encoding of the proof systems associated with concrete DL knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K, where {a mathematical formula}K and the instance query are represented by a set of facts.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For example, for axioms of the form {a mathematical formula}D(A ⊑ B), the following overriding rule is added to the local programs:{a mathematical formula} Intuitively, this rule states that, if {a mathematical formula}y=A is included in {a mathematical formula}z=B by a defeasible global axiom ({a mathematical formula}def_subclass(y,z)) and in context c we can prove for {a mathematical formula}x=e that {a mathematical formula}A(e) (i.e., {a mathematical formula}instd(x,y,c,main)) but {a mathematical formula}¬B(e) ({a mathematical formula}nottest_fails(nlit(x,z,c))), then there is an overriding for this axiom with respect to e in context c ({a mathematical formula}ovr(subClass,x,y,z,c)).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In turn, the positive literals in {a mathematical formula}Sc, 〈 Α ,e 〉 must be derived via the materialization calculus, and the negative literals via contradiction proofs defined by the test mechanism mentioned at the beginning of Section 5.2 and previously detailed.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In the translation of local programs, we also add the defeasibility deduction rules of {a mathematical formula}PD, defining the rules for overriding and defeasible propagation of the global knowledge: in particular, the following rule ovr-subc provides the condition for overriding of atomic inclusion axioms like the one considered in our example:{a mathematical formula} Propagation of defeasible atomic inclusion axioms is defined by the rule prop-subc:{a mathematical formula} In Step 3 of the translation, the final program {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD) results as the union of {a mathematical formula}PG(G) and all the local programs, including {a mathematical formula}PC(cultural_tourist,KtourD).Let us now consider what can be inferred from {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We show the claim for the contextualized FO-translation {a mathematical formula} Φ K,xc in (5); the result for the ordinary translation {a mathematical formula} Φ K is then obvious.To prove the result, we need to show that each axiom Α in K can be written as a universal Horn sentence {a mathematical formula} ∀ x. Φ Α (x,xc), where {a mathematical formula}x=x1, … ,xn is a list of free variables in {a mathematical formula} Φ Α (x,xc) depending on the type of the axiom Α as follows:</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The assertion can be proved by introducing a measure on input axioms from {a mathematical formula}K. Given a concept C over Σ or Γ , we define its size {a mathematical formula} ‖ C ‖ as:</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Similarly for {a mathematical formula}a ∈ NI Γ ‾ and the global interpretation {a mathematical formula}M ‾ .If {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ,e 〉 ∈ Χ (x): if Α is in normal form, then {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ,e 〉 ∈ Χ ′ (x); otherwise, let {a mathematical formula} Α ′ be the (single) defeasible axiom in the set obtained by exhaustively applying the rules in Table 2 to Α , then {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ′ ,e 〉 ∈ Χ ′ (x).For the first direction (i), we show that for all axioms</a>
