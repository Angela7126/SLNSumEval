<a href="#0" id="0">Formally, we add action likelihood axioms to {a mathematical formula}D:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Definition 11</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Action likelihood axioms for each action type A are sentences of the form:{a mathematical formula} Here {a mathematical formula} Ψ A(x → ,u,s) is any formula characterizing the conditions under which action {a mathematical formula}A(x → ) has likelihood u in s.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Of course, a much weaker specification is possible by replacing one of these probabilistic alternatives with categorical ones.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, suppose the basic action theory were to instead include:{a mathematical formula} In this case, the agent believes that h may take a value from {a mathematical formula}{2,3} or is uniformly distributed on {a mathematical formula}{1,2, … ,10} without being able to say which.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Definition 16</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(Degrees of belief (reformulated)) Let Φ be any {a mathematical formula}L-formula.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given any sequence of ground action terms {a mathematical formula} Α =[a1, … ,ak], let{a mathematical formula} where if {a mathematical formula}s=do( Α ,S0) then{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Definition 18</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">(Degrees of belief (continuous noisy sensors)) Let Φ be any situation-suppressed {a mathematical formula}L-formula, and {a mathematical formula} Α =[a1, … ,ak] any ground sequence of action terms.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The degree of belief in Φ at s is an abbreviation:{a mathematical formula} where, as in Definition 16, if {a mathematical formula}s=do( Α ,S0) then{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Definition 23</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">(Degrees of belief (continuous noisy effectors and sensors)) Suppose Φ is any {a mathematical formula}L-formula.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Then the degree of belief in Φ at s, written {a mathematical formula}Bel( Φ ,s), is defined as an abbreviation:{a mathematical formula} where, if {a mathematical formula}s=do([a1, … ,ak],S0), then{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let us now build a simple example with noisy actions.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Consider the robot scenario in Fig.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">1.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Suppose the basic action theory {a mathematical formula}D includes the foundational axioms, and the following components.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The initial theory {a mathematical formula}D0 includes the following p specification:{a mathematical formula} For simplicity, let h be the only fluent in the domain, and assume that actions are always executable.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The successor state axiom for the fluent h is (14).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">For p, it is the usual one, viz.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">(P2).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">From this, we then provide the following successor state axiom for w:{a mathematical formula} For simplicity, assume that the action {a mathematical formula}move(z) moves the robot towards the wall by z units (that is, it is deterministic), for which we use the successor state axiom (7).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Analogously, imagine a noisy sensor {a mathematical formula}seewin(z) that provides a reading of x for the status of the window, but with the following error profile:{a mathematical formula} That is, when returning 1, the sensor gives the correct reading with a probability of .8, but when returning 0, the sensor gives the correct reading with a probability of .7.</a>
