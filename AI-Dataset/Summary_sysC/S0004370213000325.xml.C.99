<a href="#0" id="0">This latter cost is the sum, for all j, of the cost {a mathematical formula} Β (j) of obtaining j agent values multiplied by all {a mathematical formula}(Nj) combinations of j agents whose values can be obtained, multiplied by the probability {a mathematical formula}F(ri|ri − 1)j(1 − F(ri|ri − 1))N − j of obtaining exactly j agent values in round i if none were found in previous rounds.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The probability of starting round i is {a mathematical formula}(1 − F(ri − 1))N, which is the probability that no agent values are below the previous reservation value {a mathematical formula}ri − 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The expected cost of using strategy S is thus the sum of the expected cost of each of the M search rounds weighted by the probability of reaching that round:{a mathematical formula} The probability of starting the ith search round can alternatively be formulated as the probability that no values were obtained in each of the {a mathematical formula}i − 1 previous rounds, expressed as {a mathematical formula} ∏ j=1i − 1(1 − F(rj|rj − 1))N. Therefore, (4) transforms into:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the specific case in which the reservation values are chosen from a finite set of L values {a mathematical formula}{x1, … ,xL}, {a mathematical formula}xmin<xi<xi+1<xL=xmax for all i, the optimal strategy can be derived with the following dynamic programming formulation in {a mathematical formula}O(L2N) time:{a mathematical formula} Here, {a mathematical formula}C(l) is the cost of continuing the search if a search using reservation value {a mathematical formula}xl failed to obtain any applicable agent values.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First we show how to derive the reservation probability P, and then we show how to calculate each {a mathematical formula}ri.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since the optimal sequence is infinite and the expected cost from each round onwards is stationary, the expected cost of using P can be expressed with the following equation:{a mathematical formula} Here, the first term is the fixed cost per round, the second term is the expected cost of obtaining any values, and the last term is the expected cost of continuing the search if necessary.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consequently:{a mathematical formula} The value {a mathematical formula}P=P ⁎ that minimizes {a mathematical formula}V(P) in (11) is the optimal reservation probability.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Based on (2), each {a mathematical formula}ri corresponding to {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ can be calculated by solving for {a mathematical formula}ri in the equation {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ =F(ri) − F(ri − 1)1 − F(ri − 1), which yields the equation{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Just as in (7), (11) can be decomposed into two parts: {a mathematical formula} Α 1 − (1 − P)N and {a mathematical formula} ∑ j=1N Β (j)(Nj)Pj(1 − P)N − j1 − (1 − P)N, respectively representing the expected contribution of the fixed cost to the total search cost and the expected cost of obtaining the agent values.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The expected number of search rounds is {a mathematical formula}11 − (1 − P)N. The probability of obtaining j agent values is {a mathematical formula}(Nj)Pj(1 − P)N − j1 − (1 − P)N, since this becomes a Bernoulli sampling process with a success probability of {a mathematical formula}1 − (1 − P)N.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">An important result of the above analysis is that P is distribution independent.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In contrast to Proposition 1, Proposition 2 states that the optimal strategy when there is no cost for initiating a new search round ({a mathematical formula} Α =0) is to increment the reservation value by the smallest amount possible, such that the expected number of values obtained is minimized.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Finally, Proposition 3 highlights how the tradeoff between obtaining a certain number of agents and continuing a search is affected by P in the case where the cost of obtaining the values of j agents is linear in j.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Although the expected number of search rounds decreases as a consequence, the expected cost still increases, due to the greater cost per round.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For large values of Α and all {a mathematical formula} Β (j) cost functions, the reservation probability is set such that the expected number of search rounds is close to 1 due to the substantial cost of initiating a new search round.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This result is in turn used to prove the inductive step, since the expected cost is independent of the actual sequence of reservation values.In the base cases, {a mathematical formula}Vk ′ =0 ∀ k ′ ⩾ K by definition, since the search is terminated in such cases.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">(11), we can formulate the expected cost of using this reservation probability as:{a mathematical formula} This expression is independent of any reservation values used during the search, thus completing the inductive step that shows that the expected cost of continuing the search from any state {a mathematical formula}(r,k) is some constant {a mathematical formula}Vk.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The expected cost of applying a strategy {a mathematical formula}S=[r1, … ,rm=xmax] is thus similar to (4), except that {a mathematical formula} Β (j) is replaced with the cost {a mathematical formula}V(j,ri − 1,ri) of conducting the optimal sequential economic search on j items whose values are between the last two reservation values used, {a mathematical formula}ri − 1 and {a mathematical formula}ri.</a>
