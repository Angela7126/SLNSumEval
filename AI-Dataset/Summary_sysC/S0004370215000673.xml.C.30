<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we take our moves from the notion of propositional rational closure given by Lehmann and Magidor, and we show that it can be naturally extended to the description logic {a mathematical formula}ALC.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Furthermore, we investigate its semantics, by extending to {a mathematical formula}ALC the minimal model semantics introduced at the propositional level in order to address question A.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This semantics provides a characterization to the rational closure construction for {a mathematical formula}ALC.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The rational closure construction we propose for {a mathematical formula}ALC has not just a theoretical interest and a simple minimal model semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For {a mathematical formula}ALC, the problem of deciding whether a typical inclusion belongs to the rational closure of the TBox is in ExpTime as well as the problem of deciding whether an assertion {a mathematical formula}C(a) belongs to the rational closure of the knowledge base over the ABox.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">Given a rational model {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 W,<,V 〉 , let us now define the rank {a mathematical formula}kM(w) of a world w and the rank {a mathematical formula}kM(F) of a formula F.</a>

<a href="#12" id="12">Although the operator {a mathematical formula}| ∼ is nonmonotonic, the notion of rational entailment (defined in Definition 1) in itself is monotonic: if {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ F and {a mathematical formula}K ⊆ K ⁎ then also {a mathematical formula}K ⁎ ⊨ F.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Since in rational closure no boolean combination of conditionals is allowed, in the following, the knowledge base K is just a finite set of positive conditional assertions of the form {a mathematical formula}A| ∼ B.</a>

<a href="#17" id="17">We begin by proving a property that links the rank {a mathematical formula}kM of a formula in any rational model {a mathematical formula}M of a given knowledge base K and the rank of that formula as calculated in the definition of rational closure (Definition 5).</a>

<a href="#35" id="35">We recall here the semantic definition of both and then we remark upon their relation with our semantics and rational closure.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">A model {a mathematical formula}M for a finite knowledge base K has the form {a mathematical formula}M=({true,false}ATM,kM) where {a mathematical formula}{true,false}ATM is the set of propositional interpretations for, say, a fixed finite propositional language, and {a mathematical formula}kM is our height function mapping propositional interpretations to {a mathematical formula}N, the definition of height {a mathematical formula}kM(A) of a formula is the same as in our semantic.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">A conditional {a mathematical formula}A| ∼ B is true in a model {a mathematical formula}M if {a mathematical formula}kM(A ∧ B)<kM(A ∧ ¬B).</a>

<a href="#40" id="40">By Theorem 2, we therefore obtain {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ 1-entA| ∼ B if and only if {a mathematical formula}A| ∼ B ∈ K¯.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Given a knowledge base K, an inclusion {a mathematical formula}CL ⊑ CR and an assertion {a mathematical formula}CL(a), with {a mathematical formula}a ∈ O, we say that:</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Rank of a domain element {a mathematical formula}kM(x)Given a model {a mathematical formula}M= 〈 Δ ,<,I 〉 , the rank {a mathematical formula}kM of a domain element {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Δ , is the length of the longest chain {a mathematical formula}x0< … <x from x to a minimal {a mathematical formula}x0 (i.e.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">such that there is no {a mathematical formula}x ′ such that {a mathematical formula}x ′ <x0).</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">In this section, we extend to {a mathematical formula}ALC+TR the definition of rational closure introduced by Lehmann and Magidor for the propositional case.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">This is needed when the ABox contains typicality assertions of the form {a mathematical formula}T(C)(a).</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">Indeed, as we will see later with an example, the construction of the rational closure of the TBox of a knowledge base K is affected by the presence of typicality assertions in the ABox: if the assertions {a mathematical formula}T(C)(a) and {a mathematical formula}¬D(a) are in the ABox, it is not the case that all the typical C's are D's, so that the defeasible inclusion {a mathematical formula}T(C) ⊑ D does not hold.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">Then from the above definition it follows that if a concept C has a rank, its highest possible value is n. As for propositional logic, the notion of rank of a formula allows to define the rational closure of a knowledge base K with respect to TBox.</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">Rational closure of TBoxLet {a mathematical formula}K=(TBox,ABox) be a DL knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">We define {a mathematical formula}TBox¯, the rational closure of TBox, as{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">It can be easily seen that the rational closure of TBox is a nonmonotonic strengthening of {a mathematical formula}ALC+TR.</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">So far we have extended to {a mathematical formula}ALC+TR the syntactic notion of rational closure.</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">We wonder whether we provide a semantic characterization of this notion by extending the semantic characterization given at the propositional level.</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">As for the propositional case (in the case of FIMS), in order to semantically characterize the rational closure, we first restrict our attention to minimal rational models that minimize the rank of domain elements.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">Informally, given two models of K, one in which a given domain element x has rank 2 (because for instance {a mathematical formula}z<y<x), and another in which it has rank 1 (because only {a mathematical formula}y<x), we prefer the latter, as in this model the element x is assumed to be “ more typical ” than in the former.</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">{a mathematical formula} Δ = Δ ′</a>
<a href="#56" id="56">for all {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Δ , it holds that {a mathematical formula}kM(x) ≤ kM ′ (x) whereas there exists {a mathematical formula}y ∈ Δ such that {a mathematical formula}kM(y)<kM ′ (y).</a>
<a href="#57" id="57">Next we define the notion of minimal canonical model.</a>
<a href="#58" id="58">Minimal canonical models (with respect to TBox){a mathematical formula}M is a minimal canonical model of K if it satisfies K, it is minimal (with respect to Definition 23) and it is canonical (according to Definition 24).</a>

<a href="#62" id="62">Let{a mathematical formula}K=(TBox,ABox)be a knowledge base and{a mathematical formula}C ⊑ Da query.</a>

<a href="#66" id="66">We say that {a mathematical formula}M is preferred to {a mathematical formula}M ′ with respect to ABox, and we write {a mathematical formula}M<ABoxM ′ , if, for all individual constants a occurring in ABox, it holds that {a mathematical formula}kM(aI) ≤ kM ′ (aI ′ ) and there is at least one individual constant b occurring in ABox such that {a mathematical formula}kM(bI)<kM ′ (bI ′ ).</a>
<a href="#67" id="67">The rational closure of ABox ({a mathematical formula}ABox¯) is the set of all assertions derivable in {a mathematical formula}ALC+TR from {a mathematical formula}TBox ∪ ABox ∪ Μ j for all minimal consistent rank assignments {a mathematical formula}kj, i.e.</a>
