<a href="#0" id="0">An instance of Α -CC-DisWinner problem consists of a set of agents {a mathematical formula}N=[n], a set of alternatives {a mathematical formula}A={a1, … ,am}, a preference profile V of the agents, and a positive integer K. We ask for a K-assignment function Φ such that {a mathematical formula} ℓ sum Α ( Φ ) is minimized.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It turns out that unless {a mathematical formula}P=NP, then for each {a mathematical formula}r,s>1 there is no {a mathematical formula}(r,s)-approximation algorithm that finds an assignment with the following properties: (1) the aggregated dissatisfaction {a mathematical formula} ℓ sum Α ( Φ ) is at most r times higher than the optimal one, (2) the number of alternatives to which agents are assigned is at most sK and (3) each selected alternative (i.e., each alternative that has agents assigned), is assigned to no more than {a mathematical formula}snK and no less than {a mathematical formula}1snK agents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a preference profile and a set S of up to K alternatives, using the standard network-flow argument, it is easy to find a (possibly partial) optimal assignment {a mathematical formula} Φ Α S of the agents to the alternatives from S.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus the total dissatisfaction of the agents in the optimal solution is:{a mathematical formula} By taking large enough m and K (even for a fixed value of {a mathematical formula}mK), the fraction {a mathematical formula}1 − K − 12(m − 1) can be arbitrarily close to the approximation ratio of our algorithm (the reasoning here is somewhat in the spirit of the idea of identifying maximally robust elections, as studied by Shiryaev, Yu, and Elkind [53]).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This proves our bound on the expected satisfaction of a solution yielded by optimally matching a random sample of K alternatives.Since OPT is upper bounded by {a mathematical formula}(m − 1)n (consider a possibly-nonexistent solution where every agent is assigned to his or her top preference), we get that:{a mathematical formula} We can compute the unconditional expected satisfaction of {a mathematical formula} Φ B as follows:{a mathematical formula} Since {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1Kpi ⋅ i is the expected value of {a mathematical formula}Kopt, we have that {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1Kpi ⋅ i=K2m (one can think of summing the expected values of K indicator random variables; one for each element of {a mathematical formula}Aopt, taking the value 1 if a given alternative is selected and taking the value 0 otherwise).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In our further experiments, where we considered larger elections, we were not able to compute optimal solutions, but the fraction {a mathematical formula}C/Cideal gives a lower bound for {a mathematical formula}C/Copt.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We report this value for small elections so that we can see an example of the relation between {a mathematical formula}C/Copt and {a mathematical formula}C/Cideal and so that we can compare the results for small elections with the results for the larger ones.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">( ⇐ ) If there exists an exact set cover of U with sets from {a mathematical formula}F, then it is easy to construct a solution for {a mathematical formula}IM where the satisfaction of each agent is greater or equal to {a mathematical formula}r ⋅ Α m+m ′ (3).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, Algorithm {a mathematical formula}A has to return an assignment with the minimal satisfaction greater or equal to {a mathematical formula}r ⋅ Α m+m ′ (3).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">( ⇒ ) For the other direction, we first show that {a mathematical formula}r ⋅ Α m+m ′ (3) ≥ Α m+m ′ (m ′ ).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since DPSFs are strictly decreasing, it holds that:{a mathematical formula} Then, by the definition of DPSFs, it holds that:{a mathematical formula} Using the fact that {a mathematical formula}m ′ =( Α m+1(1) ⋅ ⌈ 1 − rr ⌉ +3) and using (2), we can transform inequality (1) to obtain the following:{a mathematical formula} This means that if the minimal satisfaction of an agent is at least {a mathematical formula}r ⋅ Α m+m ′ (3), then no agent was assigned to an alternative that she ranked beyond position {a mathematical formula}m ′ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In consequence, the covering subfamily of {a mathematical formula}F consists simply of those sets {a mathematical formula}Ft, for which some agent is assigned to alternative {a mathematical formula}at ∈ A1.The presented construction gives the exact algorithm for Set-Cover problem running in time {a mathematical formula}f(K)(n+m)O(1), where {a mathematical formula}f(K) is polynomial in {a mathematical formula}( ⌈ 2r ⌉ K).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">(4) as follows:{a mathematical formula} For the remaining cases (corresponding to the “ otherwise ” clause in the definition of {a mathematical formula}r(i)), we set {a mathematical formula}Px=P and (4) becomes:{a mathematical formula} Naturally, we replace our estimates by 0 whenever they become negative.To complete the proof, it suffice to, as in the proof of Lemma 4, note that {a mathematical formula}(m − 1)n is an upper bound on the satisfaction achieved by the optimal solution.</a>
