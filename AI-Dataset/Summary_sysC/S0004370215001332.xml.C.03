<a href="#6" id="6">In these problem formulations, voltage is not controllable but instead imposes constraints on the power flow.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The pddl model of the Simple Voltage domain is shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this section we introduce the main components of power systems, and the fundamentals necessary for understanding the AC voltage control problem tackled in this paper.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The AC voltage control problem is concerned with maintaining the voltage at each busbar of a distribution network (or a zone of the network) within a given bound, for an extended period of time, assuming that the load profile of consumers and the schedule of the power system generators are known over this period.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The decision variables are the tap ratios of transformers, the status of the capacitors and reactors and the level of power demand that can be shed from the network, while the network has to respect the voltage constraint:{a mathematical formula} where N is the total number of busbars present in the network.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The AC power flow equations cannot be expressed in pddl, so we use a specialised external solver to compute their effects when actions are applied.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Therefore the AC voltage control problem is a BTMP.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The power of the abstraction is that the planner knows that it is applying an action that changes the network state, and can access the values of mixed metric expressions that are affected by the solver, but does not require a declarative description of the effects of those changes on the network.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">{a mathematical formula}Vspecial: numeric variables that record the indirect effects and are calculated by an external solver linked to the planner;</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula}Vindep: variables that are affected by actions without resulting in any external computation.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For example, in the AC voltage control domain, the {a mathematical formula}Vdep variables are the tap settings which are changed when the planner applies an action to step a transformer up (or down).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">By contrast, the AC Voltage Control problem is in the top right quadrant.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The planner calls the external solver through an interface consisting of variables in {a mathematical formula}Vdep ∪ Vspecial.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">When the planner updates a state, if one of the {a mathematical formula}Vdep variables changes, then the external solver is invoked via the instantaneous update effect described in Definition 9.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The reachable values of the {a mathematical formula}Vspecial variables are not accessible to the planner, so in order to obtain any heuristic information from the external solver, the planner requires a relaxation of the Network encapsulated type.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">This arises in the AC voltage control problem in the following way.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Since the over all constraint, in the constraint-check action, refers to the Network voltage, the computation of {a mathematical formula}P[v/ Α ] (Definition 11) exploits the external solver to determine the actual value of the Network voltage for the particular p-level and q-level load and generation settings.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">First we present an illustrative example where our planner finds a sequence of actions to manage AC voltage control in a 33 kV network used as a benchmark in the AuRA-NMS project [37].</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Finally we present a brief study of the accuracy of the first order approximation of the effects of actions on the {a mathematical formula}Vspecial variables in the heuristic evaluation.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">We consider the AC voltage control problem over the period of 24 hours, given that the load and generation profiles are described at 30 minute intervals.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">That is, the capacitor effects are treated as {a mathematical formula}Vspecial variables and updated in each state by a call to the external solver (dynamic first order approximation).</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The steady state AC power flow for the busbar k is then given by:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Vk is the complex voltage {a mathematical formula}Vkej Δ k and j is the complex square root of − 1.</a>
