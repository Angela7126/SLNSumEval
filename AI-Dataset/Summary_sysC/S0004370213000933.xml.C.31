<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula} Θ (1in).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Moreover, the probability of transferring at steps 2 and 4 is {a mathematical formula} Ω (1n2).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, the expected steps after the initialization procedure to generate the optimal Pareto front is {a mathematical formula} Θ ( ∑ i=1n − 1in)= Θ (n3).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By combining the expected running time {a mathematical formula} Θ (n2) of the initialization in Lemma 1, the expected running time of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecomb,0onebit on Weighted LPTNO is {a mathematical formula} Θ (n3).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Proof</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">After the initialization procedure, the two Pareto optimal solutions {a mathematical formula}1n and {a mathematical formula}( − 1)n have been found.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, it is sufficient to increase the number of Pareto optimal solutions {a mathematical formula}n − 1 times to find the optimal Pareto front.Before finding the optimal Pareto front, there always exists at least one Pareto optimal solution in the current population which can generate one new Pareto optimal solution by flipping just the rightmost positive one bit or the leftmost negative one bit.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Because the probability of selecting a specific solution is at least {a mathematical formula}1n − 1 by Lemma 2, the number of Pareto optimal solutions increases in one step with probability at least {a mathematical formula}1n − 11n(1 − 1n)n − 1 ⩾ 1en(n − 1).Thus, the expected running time to find the optimal Pareto front after the initialization procedure is at most {a mathematical formula}2en(n − 1)2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By combining the expected running time {a mathematical formula} Θ (n2) of the initialization procedure in Lemma 1, the expected running time of the whole evolution process is {a mathematical formula} Ω (n2) and {a mathematical formula}O(n3).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We have proved that the expected running time of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecombonebit/MOEArecombbitwise without crossover on COCZ is {a mathematical formula} Ω (n2)/ Ω (nlnn), which increases from {a mathematical formula} Θ (nlnn) of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecombonebit/MOEArecombbitwise with crossover probability 0.5.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Thus, recombination is crucial for the efficiency of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecombonebit/MOEArecombbitwise on the COCZ problem.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">From the analysis, we can also find that recombination works by accelerating the filling of the Pareto front through recombining diverse optimal solutions found-so-far, as that we have found from the analysis on the Weighted LPTNO problem.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Our second task is to approximate the optimal Pareto front of the general bi-objective MST problem, particularly, find {a mathematical formula}(1+ Ε )-approximation as defined in Definition 10, which means that for every Pareto optimal solution we have a solution that is {a mathematical formula}(1+ Ε ) close on every objective.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In this section, we analyze the expected running time of {a mathematical formula}MOEArecombbitwise on the bi-objective MST problem for the above two tasks, i.e., finding the optimal Pareto front for the bi-objective MST problem with {a mathematical formula}F ⁎ =sconv(F ⁎ ), and finding a 2-approximation of the optimal Pareto front for the general bi-objective MST problem.</a>
