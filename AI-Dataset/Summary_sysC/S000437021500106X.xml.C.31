<a href="#1" id="1">In order to get more insight into the effect of ADW's disambiguation step on the final performance when measuring the similarity of word pairs, we carried out a series of experiments where no disambiguation was performed on the two linguistic items.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the absence of the disambiguation step, a semantic signature for a linguistic item is generated by initializing the PPR algorithm from all the nodes (i.e., synsets) associated with that linguistic item, rather than the specific disambiguated synsets obtained as a result of the alignment-based disambiguation (see Section 5.1).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In other words, the personalization vector {a mathematical formula}S0 in Equation (2) is constructed by uniformly distributing the probability mass among all the corresponding dimensions of all senses of all the content words in the item.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that in this case the semantic signature of a linguistic item is generated independently of its paired linguistic item.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As we mentioned in Section 5.3 the disambiguation step is particularly suitable for short textual items, such as words or phrases, as an implicit disambiguation takes place when modeling longer textual items such as sentences.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We argued that the disambiguation step might not be as effective for long textual items.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In order to verify this, we carried out our sentence-level experiments with a variant of our system that did not involve the disambiguation step.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As we also described in our analysis in the word level, in the absence of the disambiguation step, a semantic signature is constructed by initializing the PPR algorithm from all nodes associated with all the senses of the content words in the linguistic item.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Experiments were carried out on the five sentence-level datasets and for the three variants of our WordNet-based system, i.e., ADWWN, ADWWN:I, and ADWWN:M and the two variants of the Wiktionary-based system, i.e., ADWWT, ADWWT:I.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We observed that in all the variants and according to both evaluation measures, the differences in the performance values with and without the disambiguation step were not statistically significant.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This confirms our hypothesis that, when there is enough context in a linguistic item, which is the case in sentence similarity, an implicit disambiguation takes place during the generation of semantic signatures.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">However, note that when the disambiguation step is involved, our system provides the advantage of having, as a byproduct of similarity measurement, the two linguistic items explicitly disambiguated with respect to each other according to the adopted semantic network.</a>
