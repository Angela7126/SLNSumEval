<a href="#0" id="0">A hybrid MKNF knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K consists of two components, {a mathematical formula}K=(O,P), where {a mathematical formula}O is a DL knowledge base, which corresponds to a decidable first-order theory, and {a mathematical formula}P is a collection of MKNF rules based on the stable model semantics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In fact, though we often refer to {a mathematical formula}O of {a mathematical formula}K=(O,P) as a DL knowledge base, {a mathematical formula}O can be considered an external theory, which possibly shares vocabulary with {a mathematical formula}P. In any case, we only need to assume that {a mathematical formula} Π (O) is a first-order theory that offers a decidable entailment relation between formulas and ground literals.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To obtain the well-founded MKNF model of an MKNF-consistent hybrid MKNF knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K, the well-founded partition of {a mathematical formula}KA(K) is computed by the so-called alternating fixpoint construction, which applies two antitonic operators alternately to compute a least fixpoint and a greatest fixpoint, which correspond, respectively, to the true and non-false knowledge.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Claim (1) (Theorem 1 in [9]) If {a mathematical formula}K is an MKNF-consistent hybrid MKNF knowledge base, then a well-founded MKNF model exists, and it is unique.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, it is easy to check that the truth value evaluation of modal atoms based on such an MKNF structure {a mathematical formula} Ω =(I, 〈 M ′ ,N ′ 〉 , 〈 M,N 〉 ) (see Table 2) is related to memberships based on a partition {a mathematical formula}(T ′ ,P ′ ) in the following way: for any (ground) first-order atom Ξ , we have{a mathematical formula} By the rule evaluation defined in this section and the evaluation by a structure in Table 2, we conclude that these evaluations produce the same result for any rule in {a mathematical formula}P. □</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This shows that {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊂ T is impossible, and because {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊆ T, we must have {a mathematical formula}T ′ =T, i.e., {a mathematical formula} Γ K(P)=T.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">One useful result derived from this theorem is an alternative way of checking the property of MKNF-coherence of a given hybrid MKNF knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K. Once its alternating fixpoint pair {a mathematical formula}(P Ω ,N Ω ) is computed, instead of a full verification that {a mathematical formula}(P Ω ,N Ω ) is stable, we can just perform a consistency test.</a>
