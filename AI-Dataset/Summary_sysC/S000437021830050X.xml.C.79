<a href="#0" id="0">Specifically, we show that for any instance of the hitting set problem, we can construct an election with n voter groups, so that there exists a hitting set {a mathematical formula}G ′ if and only if it is possible to prevent any control with m resources, i.e., the attacker cannot make Ω lose by attacking any subset of the {a mathematical formula}n − m unprotected groups.Given an instance of the hitting set problem, we construct an election as follows.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Specifically, we show that for any instance of the hitting set problem, we can construct an election with n voter groups, 2 candidates, and a set {a mathematical formula}S ′ of defender strategies, so that there exists a hitting set {a mathematical formula}G ′ if and only if there exists an attacker strategy which can control the election no matter which defender strategy {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S ′ is played.Given an instance of a hitting set problem, we construct an election with {a mathematical formula}|G|+1 voter groups and two candidates, Ω and some other candidate c, and assume that the attacker can attack m groups.</a>
