<a href="#0" id="0">In Section 2 we first review a number of stable matching variants that formulate constraints on the matching process and have found recent interest in the literature.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given an instance of socially stable matching consisting of a graph {a mathematical formula}GM=(VM,EM) of potential matching edges, social link set {a mathematical formula}L ⊆ EM, and edge benefits b, we construct an equivalent coalition formation game with consistent constraints as follows.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We keep the agent set, the coalition set, and the benefits.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The set of self-generating coalitions {a mathematical formula}Cg is set to L, and {a mathematical formula}T= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Further, the only constraints for generation of an available coalition are based on the agents' desire to improve their benefits, that is, {a mathematical formula}D=Db.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">These generation and domination rules are obviously consistent.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given an instance of locally stable matching consisting of a graph {a mathematical formula}GM=(VM,EM) of potential matching edges, social link set L, and edge benefits b, we construct an equivalent coalition formation game with consistent constraints as follows.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We again keep the agent set, the coalition set, and the benefits.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The set of self-generating coalitions and the generation rules become{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} The domination rules are {a mathematical formula}D=Db.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Given an instance of considerate stable matching consisting of a graph {a mathematical formula}GM=(VM,EM) of potential matching edges, social link set L, and edge benefits b, we construct an equivalent coalition formation game with consistent constraints as follows.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We again keep the agent set, the coalition set, and the benefits.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Since there are no visibility constraints, we set {a mathematical formula}Cg=E, {a mathematical formula}T= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The main restriction is externality, which we capture using the domination rules {a mathematical formula}D=Db ∪ D1 with{a mathematical formula} Note that the precondition and the target coalitions of every rule in {a mathematical formula}D1 overlap, which implies they are consistent.</a>
