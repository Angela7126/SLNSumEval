<a href="#0" id="0">Measuring the semantic similarity of pairs of linguistic items can be performed at different linguistic levels.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this work, we focus on three main levels: senses, words, and sentences.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Table 1 lists example semantic similarity judgments for pairs belonging to each of these three linguistic levels.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">At the word level, semantic similarity usually corresponds to the similarity of the closest senses of the paired words [25].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We review the techniques for semantic similarity measurement according to the linguistic level they can be applied to: sense, word, and text level, and summarize the most important approaches at each level.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In Section 4, we described how we construct two semantic networks based on two different lexical resources, i.e., WordNet and Wiktionary.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, our two sense grouping datasets are based on the WordNet sense inventory only.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This does not allow us to use the WKT graph for clustering these datasets.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We therefore utilize only the WordNet network in our sense-level experiments.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In Section 4.3 we described our approach for the automatic construction of two semantic networks, namely W2V and DM, by leveraging two popular distributional semantic models.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In addition, we mentioned in Section 4.2 that we also constructed a variant of the Wiktionary graph, called WKTall, in which all the content words in the definitions are exploited so as to make a denser semantic network.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In order to verify the reliability of our automatically-induced networks for the generation of semantic signatures and also to test whether the richness of ADW's semantic network always results in its better performance, we carried out an evaluation on all these three graphs in the task of word similarity measurement.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Moreover, ADW performs significantly better when only hyperlinked words in the definitions of word senses are utilized for the construction of the semantic network (i.e., WKT graph), rather than all its content words (i.e., WKTall graph).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In order to get more insight into the effect of ADW's disambiguation step on the final performance when measuring the similarity of word pairs, we carried out a series of experiments where no disambiguation was performed on the two linguistic items.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In the absence of the disambiguation step, a semantic signature for a linguistic item is generated by initializing the PPR algorithm from all the nodes (i.e., synsets) associated with that linguistic item, rather than the specific disambiguated synsets obtained as a result of the alignment-based disambiguation (see Section 5.1).</a>
