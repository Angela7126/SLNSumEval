<a href="#0" id="0">Models of Horn formulas are distinguished by the fact that they are closed under intersection of positive atoms in an interpretation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">That is:{a mathematical formula} Note that the converse is also true; i.e., if a set of models W is closed under intersection of positive atoms in an interpretation, then there is a Horn formula Φ such that {a mathematical formula}[ Φ ]=W.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">1 suffices to show this: Defining revision according to Definition 2 yields a revision function that satisfies (H*1) – (H*8) (see Proposition 1) and yet violates (Acyc) (simply consider the revisions by the Horn formulas {a mathematical formula} Μ 0=r, {a mathematical formula} Μ 1=q, and {a mathematical formula} Μ 2=p).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As mentioned in the beginning of the proof, the next step is to define an extension of {a mathematical formula} ⪯ ⁎ which is total, and preserves the Μ -minimal worlds, for all Horn formulas Μ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Define {a mathematical formula} ⪯ Μ to be equal to ⪯ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Clearly, in this case {a mathematical formula} ⪯ Μ satisfies (IR1) – (IR4).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, since ⪯ is Horn compliant, so is {a mathematical formula} ⪯ Μ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally for faithfulness, since Μ is inconsistent, by (H*2), {a mathematical formula}[H ⁎ Μ ]= ∅ and therefore {a mathematical formula} ⪯ Μ is trivially faithful with respect to {a mathematical formula}H ⁎ Μ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence the theorem is true when Μ is inconsistent.Assume now that Μ is consistent.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We define {a mathematical formula} ⪯ Μ as follows:{a mathematical formula} According to the above definition, to construct {a mathematical formula} ⪯ Μ , one starts with ⪯ and simply places the minimal Μ -worlds (with respect to ⪯ ) at the beginning of the ranking; everything else remains the same.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this section, we take advantage of this feature of Horn logic, and develop two specific Horn revision operators, called basic and canonical revision, which also have polynomial time complexity; in particular, {a mathematical formula}O(n) and {a mathematical formula}O(n2log ⁡ n) respectively.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We define the basic Horn ranking associated with H, denoted ⪯ , as follows:{a mathematical formula} This ordering reflects an intuition deriving from the logic programming community, that an atom is false unless it is (depending on the underlying approach) “ required ” to be true.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">An immediate consequence of the above result is that, for any consistent Horn formula Μ , there is only one smallest Μ -world (in terms of cardinality); namely the world {a mathematical formula}w Μ as defined in Proposition 5.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Consequently, given the definition of the basic ranking ⪯ associated with a Horn belief set H, if {a mathematical formula}H+ Μ ⊢ ⊥ , then {a mathematical formula}min ⁡ ([ Μ ], ⪯ ) is a singleton.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In terms of computational complexity, in [13] it has been shown that Horn satisfiability, as well as the computation of {a mathematical formula}w Μ (if Μ is satisfiable), can be accomplished in linear time.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Hence the overall time complexity of A1 is also linear.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As discussed above, the “ maximalist ” behaviour of basic Horn revision (as stated in Corollary 2), may not be a desirable feature in some cases.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Therefore in this section we introduce a second Horn revision operator, denoted ⋆ , which we call canonical Horn revision.</a>
