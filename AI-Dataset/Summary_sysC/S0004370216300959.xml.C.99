<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, our work differs substantially from the others in several respects: first, in marked contrast to most other resources, but similarly to WikiNet and WikiTaxonomy, our resource is self-contained and does not depend on other resources such as WordNet; second, similarly to MENTA and differently from all others, we address the taxonomization task on both sides, i.e., pages and categories, by providing an algorithm which mutually and iteratively transfers knowledge from one side of the bitaxonomy to the other; third, we provide a wide coverage bitaxonomy closer in structure and granularity to a manual WordNet-like taxonomy, in contrast, for example, to DBpedia's flat type-oriented hierarchy.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The input of the procedure is a word {a mathematical formula}lE, in the source language E and the output is a probability distribution {a mathematical formula}P( â‹… |lE) over words in the target language F. We set up the problem of finding suitable translations for a given word by exploiting, on the one hand, the interlanguage links provided by Wikipedia, and, on the other hand, the association between Wikipedia pages and the associated textual anchors occurring in the whole Wikipedia.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The TT and SISTER strategies are, instead, applicable: however, the former is effective only when some translation (provided by the TT) is contained in the textual definition of the target page {a mathematical formula}pF, while the latter is applicable only on those pages which have categories related to the hypernym lemma to be discovered, i.e., such that they bring in sister pages with a valid hypernym lemma.</a>
