<a href="#0" id="0">The overall cost of a search round i is thus {a mathematical formula} Α + Β (j), where j is the number of agents that comply with {a mathematical formula}ri.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The expected accumulated cost of finding the best-valued agent when using strategy S is denoted {a mathematical formula}V(S).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This is calculated by summing the cost of obtaining j values, over {a mathematical formula}1 ⩽ j ⩽ N, times the probability that j and only j agents comply with the reservation value published in the last search round.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The optimal sequence and its expected cost is determined by {a mathematical formula}C(0).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A unique result of the above analysis is that the optimal increasing threshold search strategy can be expressed as a single value {a mathematical formula}0<P ⩽ 1, denoted the reservation probability.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We show that there always exists a value P for which the expected cost of using the infinite sequence is less than the expected cost of using a single search when {a mathematical formula} Β (j)>0.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In contrast to Proposition 1, Proposition 2 states that the optimal strategy when there is no cost for initiating a new search round ({a mathematical formula} Α =0) is to increment the reservation value by the smallest amount possible, such that the expected number of values obtained is minimized.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The expected total cost when using this strategy is:{a mathematical formula} in which {a mathematical formula}P=F(r1).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The first two terms are the costs associated with the use of the first reservation value {a mathematical formula}r1, and the third term is the cost of obtaining all agent values if no values were obtained using {a mathematical formula}r1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The cost of initiating a search round and publishing the reservation value is set to {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ {0.001,0.01,0.1,1} in order to capture the effects of the magnitude of the ratio {a mathematical formula} Α / Β (j).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">4 shows the expected cost, the expected number of search rounds, and the 99.9th percentile of the number of search rounds required to find the best-valued agent as a function of the number of agents N, for the different values of Α and function assignments to {a mathematical formula} Β (j).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The figure also shows the reservation values to be used in each search round when {a mathematical formula}N=20.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For large values of Α and all {a mathematical formula} Β (j) cost functions, the reservation probability is set such that the expected number of search rounds is close to 1 due to the substantial cost of initiating a new search round.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">5 shows the expected cost of using the (optimal) reservation probability-based strategy and the three expanding ring-based strategies as a function of N, for different values of Α and function assignments to {a mathematical formula} Β (j).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The searcher continues its search as long as only {a mathematical formula}k<K agents have been found so far.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Since the reservation value {a mathematical formula}r ′ depends on the number of agents found so far, a search strategy cannot be defined a priori by a sequence of reservation values as in the case of a single-agent search.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The total cost of the search is {a mathematical formula}V(xmin,0)(S).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The optimal strategy can be derived with the following dynamic programming formulation, in which {a mathematical formula}C(l,k) is the cost of continuing the search after using reservation value {a mathematical formula}xl and after a total of k agents have been found so far.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">As expected, the optimal reservation probability {a mathematical formula}Pk for the multi-agent search is substantially greater than the optimal reservation probability for a single-agent search.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The expected cost of this strategy as a function of the number of agents simultaneously sampled, {a mathematical formula}0<K ⩽ N, is given by:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The expected cost of applying a strategy {a mathematical formula}S=[r1, … ,rm=xmax] is thus similar to (4), except that {a mathematical formula} Β (j) is replaced with the cost {a mathematical formula}V(j,ri − 1,ri) of conducting the optimal sequential economic search on j items whose values are between the last two reservation values used, {a mathematical formula}ri − 1 and {a mathematical formula}ri.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Finally, we note that the difference between the sequential search and the increasing threshold-limiting sequential search does not depend on the cost function {a mathematical formula} Β (j).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">This property is especially advantageous for these search methods if the cost function {a mathematical formula} Β (j) is convex (e.g., square cost).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The first term is the cost of sampling K elements; the next two terms are for the expected cost of performing a threshold search on the remaining {a mathematical formula}N − K elements; the fourth term is the expected value of the agent found if its value is below the search threshold r, which will be found either by the sample or the threshold search; and the fifth term is the expected value of the agent if its value is above r, in which case it is necessarily one of the K agents sampled.</a>
