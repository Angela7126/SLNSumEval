<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, we also give results for the case where {a mathematical formula}S is not given explicitly but by the models of a propositional formula.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given anaf{a mathematical formula}F=(A,R)and two sets of arguments{a mathematical formula}S,T ⊆ A.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover there exists an argument {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S such that {a mathematical formula}s ↦ a or {a mathematical formula}a ↦ s.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">(2) By definition, the preferred semantics yields at least one extension and for any {a mathematical formula}S,S ′ ∈ Σ (F), {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ S ′ implies {a mathematical formula}S=S ′ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The idea behind the framework is simple: we draw a relation between two arguments iff they do not occur jointly in any set {a mathematical formula}S ∈ S.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Stable semantics are the only semantics that can realize {a mathematical formula}S= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that {a mathematical formula}S= ∅ is easily stb-realizable, for instance with the framework {a mathematical formula}({a},{(a,a)}).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In Proposition 1 the only difference between stable and stage semantics was the case {a mathematical formula}S= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The following relations hold{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}In what follows, we make implicit use of the results from Theorem 1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The following result shows that the values of the function Λ carry over to the function {a mathematical formula} Δ Σ for all incomparable semantics Σ we consider in this paper.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Assume {a mathematical formula}|S ′ |=1, i.e.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula}S ′ ={s}.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The stb-realizability problem in which instances are propositional formulas,{a mathematical formula} Φ (X), is{a mathematical formula}coNP-complete.The {a mathematical formula}coNP membership is immediate from Proposition 13.To show that deciding whether {a mathematical formula} Φ (X) is stb-realizable is {a mathematical formula}coNP-hard, we use a reduction from unsat.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The Σ -realizability problem in which instances are propositional formulas,{a mathematical formula} Φ (X), is in{a mathematical formula}DPfor{a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ {pref,stage,sem}.For {a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ {pref,stage,sem} we have, with the exception of {a mathematical formula}S Σ ≠ ∅ , shown that the relevant characterizing conditions can be decided in {a mathematical formula}coNP.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The Σ -realizability problem in which instances are propositional formulas,{a mathematical formula} Φ (X), is{a mathematical formula}DP-hard{a mathematical formula} Σ ∈ {pref,stage,sem}.The proof roughly proceeds as follows (a full proof is given in Appendix A.2).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">But then there exists a set C with {a mathematical formula}A ∪ B ⊂ C ∈ com(F).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">{sup:7}Suppose that {a mathematical formula} Ψ (X) is a positive instance of {a mathematical formula}unsat+.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In this case we have {a mathematical formula}M ∪ {z} ∈ S Φ , {a mathematical formula}{y} ∈ S Φ and that {a mathematical formula}(M ∪ {z}) ∪ {y} ∉ S Φ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Now as {a mathematical formula}X ∪ {y,z} ∈ S Φ we also have that {a mathematical formula}(y,s) ∈ PairsS Φ for each {a mathematical formula}s ∈ M ∪ {z}, and thus {a mathematical formula}S Φ is not conflict-sensitive.We deduce that {a mathematical formula} Ψ (X) is accepted as an instance of {a mathematical formula}unsat+ if and only if {a mathematical formula}S Ψ is conflict-sensitive.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">assume there are {a mathematical formula}S ∈ S Ψ and {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X such that {a mathematical formula}S ∪ {x} ∉ S Ψ and {a mathematical formula}(x,s) ∈ PairsS Ψ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">But then also {a mathematical formula}S ∪ {x} ∉ S Φ and {a mathematical formula}(x,s) ∈ PairsS Φ for each {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S and thus {a mathematical formula}S Φ is not tight.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">assume there are {a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ S Ψ such that {a mathematical formula}A ∪ B ∉ S Ψ and {a mathematical formula}(a,b) ∈ PairsS Ψ for all {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A, {a mathematical formula}b ∈ B.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Then also {a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ S Φ , {a mathematical formula}A ∪ B ∉ S Φ and {a mathematical formula}(a,b) ∈ PairsS Φ for all {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A, {a mathematical formula}b ∈ B and thus {a mathematical formula}S Φ is not conflict-sensitive.</a>
