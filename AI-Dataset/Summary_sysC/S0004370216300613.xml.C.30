<a href="#0" id="0">We report out-of-domain evaluations in three languages (Dutch, English and Spanish) using four different datasets to compare our system with the best publicly available systems for those languages: Illinois NER [52] for English, Stanford NER [24] for English and Spanish, SONAR-1 NERD for Dutch [21] and Freeling for Spanish [47].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We outperform every other system in the eight out-of-domain evaluations reported in Section 4.3.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, the out-of-domain results show that our clustering features provide a simple and easy method to improve the robustness of NERC systems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 8 compares our German CoNLL 2003 results with the best previous work trained on public data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Despite using clusters from one data source only (see Table 4), results in Table 10 show that our nl-cluster model outperforms the best result published on CoNLL 2002 [16] by 3.83 points in F1 score.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Adding the English Illinois NER gazetteers [52] and trigram and character n-gram features increases the score to 85.04 F1, 5.41 points better than previous published work on this dataset.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Despite the simplicity of the ixa-pipe-nerc approach, we report best results for English in 4 different datasets: for CoNLL 2003 and for the three English out-of-domain evaluations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For German we improve the results of the best system in the GermEval 2014 task and obtain comparable results to previous work in the CoNLL 2003 dataset using publicly available data.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In Spanish we provide results on CoNLL 2002 and in two out-of-domain evaluations clearly outperforming previous best results.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For Dutch we improve over previous results in CoNLL 2002 and SONAR-1 data and two out-of-domain evaluations.</a>
