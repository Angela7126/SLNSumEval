<a href="#0" id="0">We consider a simple model of cooperation among agents called Coalitional Skill Games (CSGs).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is a restricted form of coalitional games, where each agent has a set of skills that are required to complete various tasks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each task requires a set of skills in order to be completed, and a coalition can accomplish the task only if the coalition ʼ s agents cover the set of required skills for the task.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Definition 5</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The core of a coalitional game Γ is the set of all imputations {a mathematical formula}(p1, … ,pn) that are not blocked by any coalition, so that for any coalition C, we have {a mathematical formula}p(C) ⩾ v Γ (C).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Definition 10</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">CSGA CSG is the coalitional game Γ in a coalitional skill domain, where the players are the agents of the coalitional skill domain, and the characteristic function of a coalition is the value of the tasks that coalition can perform: {a mathematical formula}v Γ (C)=u(T(C)).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Definition 13</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Both TCSG and WTSG have special cases that are simple skill games.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These games require the number of completed tasks or the total weight of completed tasks to exceed a certain threshold value k for a coalition to win.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">These versions are called TCSG-T (Task Count Skill Games with Threshold) and WTSG-T (Weighted Task Skill Games with Threshold).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">TCSG-TLet {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊆ T be a subset of tasks.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">TCSG-T is a CSG with a threshold k where the task value function is {a mathematical formula}u(T ′ )=1 if {a mathematical formula}|T ′ | ⩾ k and {a mathematical formula}u(T ′ )=0 otherwise.</a>
