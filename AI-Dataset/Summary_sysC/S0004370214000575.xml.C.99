<a href="#0" id="0">1, which relates to the search horizon as the independent variable, uses a setting with five agents as well and a search cost of 0.01 (i.e., {a mathematical formula}k=5, {a mathematical formula}c=0.01).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As expected, the overall expected utility increases as the number of opportunities that each agent can potentially explore increases.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Any other solution is a mixed strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium.The above establishes the fact that all agents will be using a reservation value strategy whenever actively engaging in search, thus we can formulate {a mathematical formula}Fjreturn(x), the probability that the maximum value obtained along the search process of an agent {a mathematical formula}Aj (that chooses to engage in search and uses {a mathematical formula}rj), is less than x, as in (3).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This facilitates the extraction of the probability distribution function of the maximum value obtained throughout agent {a mathematical formula}Aj's search, {a mathematical formula}fjreturn(x), using the same principle as in (4).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, we can now formulate the probability that the maximum value that will be found by all the agents except {a mathematical formula}Ai will be smaller than or equal to x, denoted {a mathematical formula}F¯i(x):{a mathematical formula} and finally the probability distribution function of that value, {a mathematical formula}f¯i(x), is the derivative of {a mathematical formula}F¯i(x).These enable us to calculate the expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai when any other agents {a mathematical formula}Aj uses a strategy {a mathematical formula}(pj,rj).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We use {a mathematical formula}EBj(v) to denote the overall expected utility of the agents when j search periods remain, if the optimal fully cooperative search strategy is used, given that the best value obtained so far by any of the agents is v. The value of {a mathematical formula}EBj(v) can be calculated recursively, based on the overall expected utility of the subsequent search period:{a mathematical formula} where for the case where there is only one remaining search period:{a mathematical formula} The first element in (17) represents the sum of the search costs of the agents that engage in search during the coming search period.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this case, as we prove in the following paragraphs, the agent's strategy needs to take into consideration not only the best value obtained so far, as in the “ no communication ” case, but also the remaining number of potential search periods.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's strategy can thus be represented as the mapping {a mathematical formula}S(v,j) → pij(v), where {a mathematical formula}pij(v) is the probability that {a mathematical formula}Ai will choose to explore an additional opportunity when the number of remaining allowed searches is j and the best value obtained so far by all agents is v. We use {a mathematical formula}EBij(v) to denote the expected utility of agent {a mathematical formula}Ai if it follows the optimal search strategy, given the strategies used by the other agents, with j search opportunities remaining, and the best value obtained through all the agents' searches so far is v.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Similar to the case of fully cooperative agents, here the increase in the number of remaining search periods results in a reduced individual search probability (which is equivalent to a decrease in the number of searching agents in the fully cooperative case).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The influence of the best value found thus far and the number of remaining opportunities over the expected utility, however, is strikingly opposite to the one that holds in the fully cooperative case; here an increase in these two parameters results in a decrease in the expected utility.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Therefore, despite being at an initially superior starting point (i.e., with a greater search horizon and/or with a better known value) the agents end up with an inferior expected utility.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We note that for {a mathematical formula}v>0.554, the search probability becomes zero, i.e., the agents are happy with the fallback value they already have, and further individual search is not justified.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Therefore, in this case, the agents do not incur any search costs, and the increase in v (i.e., starting with a greater fallback value) fully translates into an identical increase in the individual utility.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The reservation-value nature of the strategy is trivial.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since recall is allowed then if the agent prefers terminating search given the best known value v and {a mathematical formula}n ′ remaining uncertain opportunities it will also prefer that choice when the best known value is {a mathematical formula}v ′ >v (and {a mathematical formula}n ′ remaining uncertain opportunities).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Then we continue with an inductive proof, showing that if the reservation value calculated according to (5) is indeed the optimal strategy for any number of available opportunities {a mathematical formula}n ″ >n ′ then this reservation value should also be used when the number of available opportunities is {a mathematical formula}n ′ .In the absence of any other new information along the search process, agent {a mathematical formula}Ai's strategy is the mapping {a mathematical formula}S(x → ,n ′ ) → {terminate,resume}, where {a mathematical formula}x → is the set of values obtained so far and {a mathematical formula}n ′ is the number of potential remaining search periods.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Now consider the agent's decision regarding exploring one more opportunity, if the best value it obtained so far is x, the number of opportunities that can still be potentially explored is {a mathematical formula}n ′ , and the optimal strategy for {a mathematical formula}n ″ <n ′ is to use reservation value {a mathematical formula}ri according to (5).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">If {a mathematical formula}x>ri and the agent executes one additional search, then regardless of the value obtained next the agent will definitely terminate the search after the additional search (as it already has a value greater than {a mathematical formula}ri and according to the induction assumption the optimal strategy thereafter is the reservation value {a mathematical formula}ri).</a>
