<a href="#0" id="0">Their approach corresponds to using {a mathematical formula} ℓ -best-OWA-Winner, for some constant ℓ (however their model is a bit different because they derive utilities from distances between the agents, whereas in our case the utilities can be arbitrary).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Additionally, since every non-dummy item has value 1 for exactly 3 agents, and since every agent has at most {a mathematical formula}(p+1) items with value 1, there are exactly {a mathematical formula}(3K − n) agents that have exactly {a mathematical formula}(p+1) items in W with values 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These {a mathematical formula}(p+1)'th additional utility-1 items of the {a mathematical formula}(3k − n) agents contribute {a mathematical formula}(3K − n) Α p+1 to the total utility.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus the total utility of all agents is equal to {a mathematical formula}K ⋅ n if and only if the answer to the instance I is “ yes ” .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, we require that variables of the form {a mathematical formula}xi,j,k are consistent with those of the form {a mathematical formula}xj (constraint (b)) and that exactly K items are selected for the solution (constraint (a)).Our final constraint, constraint (e), requires that variables {a mathematical formula}xi,j,k indeed for each agent sort the items from the solution in the order of descending utility values.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let I be an instance of the Densest-K-Subgraph problem with graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) and positive integer K. From I we construct an instance {a mathematical formula}I ′ of Α -OWA-Winner, where the set of agents N is E, the set of items is {a mathematical formula}A=V ∪ {d1, … ,d ℓ − 2} (or V if {a mathematical formula} ℓ =2), and we seek a winner set of size {a mathematical formula}K+ ℓ − 2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Consequently, the total utility that the agents from the set N derive from the solution W is at least:{a mathematical formula} This is so, because for each i, {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ , each of the agents in the set {a mathematical formula}N( ℓ ) derives utility {a mathematical formula} Α i Β umax from the item that she ranks as i'th best among the items from W.By construction of our algorithm, we have:{a mathematical formula} Thus, the total utility obtained by the agents is at least:{a mathematical formula} Now, since the maximum possible total utility of all the agents is upper-bounded by {a mathematical formula}n( ∑ i=1 ℓ Α i)umax, we have that our algorithm has approximation ratio {a mathematical formula} Β (1 − ℓ exp ⁡ ( − Γ K ℓ 2)).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We reach a contradiction and we conclude that {a mathematical formula}d1 must have been a member of W. An analogous argument shows that {a mathematical formula}d2 belongs to W as well.As the result of the above reasoning, we infer that each set of winners consists of {a mathematical formula}d1, {a mathematical formula}d2, and K items from V. Whenever both {a mathematical formula}d1 and {a mathematical formula}d2 are included in the set of winners and neither item from H is, the total utility of the dummy agents is the same, irrespective which items from V are selected.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">With these observations, we now show that the answer for the input VertexCover instance is “ yes ” if and only if there is a size-{a mathematical formula}(K+2) winner set for {a mathematical formula}I ′ that for agents in the set {a mathematical formula}NE yields total utility at least {a mathematical formula}nx(K+4).</a>
