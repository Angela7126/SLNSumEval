<a href="#0" id="0">The strength of an individual's proposed group interaction depends on its position in the group, which, in turn, depends on its social relations with others (i.e., social attraction and social influence).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The dynamics of these social relations can be related to different bases of power and are operationalized in group interactions between the virtual agents and the player.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A reward social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the value that the target assigns to the rewarding action that the actor can perform ({a mathematical formula}Valuera), the target's achievement motivation ({a mathematical formula}AchievementMT) and the target's perception of the tendency of the actor to perform the rewarding action ({a mathematical formula}RewardingT,A,ra).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A reward social power is therefore directly proportional to the value of the rewarding action, the achievement motivation of the target and the target's perception of the rewarding tendency of the actor for that rewarding action.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In an influence situation, a coercive social power exists when a target (T) recognizes that an actor (A) can execute a harmful action (ca) if the action underlying the influence interaction (C) is not performed by the target.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A coercive social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the value that the target assigns to the coercive action that the actor can perform ({a mathematical formula}Valueca), the target's achievement motivation ({a mathematical formula}AchievementMT) and the target's perception of the tendency of the actor to perform the coercive action ({a mathematical formula}CoercingT,A,ca).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A coercive social power is therefore inversely proportional to the value of the coercive action and directly proportional to the target's perception of the coercive tendency of the actor for that coercive action.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The personal bias regarding achievement and the value of the coercive action vary only with the internal preferences, motivations and goals of the target.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">By contrast, the coercive tendency factor evolves based on the target's experience with the actor agent in accordance with the social power dynamics.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Regardless of the success or failure of the interaction, an immediate effect of the use of a coercive social power is that it decreases the target's liking of the actor.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The most significant differences between different legitimate social powers result from the type of norm that supports a given social power and the target's experience with the group.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">A Responsibility norm specifies that an agent should help other members of the group who are dependent on that agent.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">When a social power is based on such a norm, as modeled by Formula (11), the corresponding bias is also proportionally affected by the degree of dependence {a mathematical formula}DependenceA,T,C{sup:16} of the actor agent on the target.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This bias is also a probability variable, where a value of 0 indicates that the actor does not depend at all on the target's performance of C and a value of 1 indicates that the actor strongly depends on the target's performance of C.{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A referent social power as modeled in this work can be of one of two types: liking or status.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">A referent liking social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the strength of the liking that the target holds for the actor ({a mathematical formula}LikingT,A) and the target's personal affiliative motivation ({a mathematical formula}AffiliativeMT).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">This description is succinctly modeled by Formula (12).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">An expert social power that an actor exerts over a target that influences the latter to perform an action is a function of the importance of the skill associated with that action ({a mathematical formula}Importances,C), the trust that the target agent holds for the actor agent ({a mathematical formula}TrustT,A) and the target's perception of the skill difference between the actor and the target ({a mathematical formula}LevelDA,T,s) regarding the skill associated with the action.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">To create an agent architecture that can endow agents with social power awareness and the ability to generate behaviors based on plans while incorporating social power strategies, our main inspiration is Raven's Power/Interaction Model [66].</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The advantage of using this model is that it was specifically created to explore the links between the bases of social power introduced by French and Raven [37] (and used in the SAPIENT model) and their operationalization in influence interactions.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">In a social power interaction, there are two main interaction perspectives, each requiring a specific cognitive process.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The “ Power Effects ” attribute represents the agent's knowledge about the effects that the usage of various social power bases and strategies can have on its beliefs (e.g., an increase/decrease in a liking relation).</a>
