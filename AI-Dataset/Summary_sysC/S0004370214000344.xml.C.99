<a href="#0" id="0">Observe that the definition establishes that in a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[T,S] the source S cannot be in any place in T. A discussion considering the reasons for having this restriction is included in Section 9.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given an agent {a mathematical formula}A ∈ A, we assume its credibility base {a mathematical formula}CA is sound.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider the agents {a mathematical formula}A,B,C,I ∈ A.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As it will be explained in detail below, when an agent A receives a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[(B,C),I] which does not generate cycles in his current credibility base (i.e., {a mathematical formula}(C,B) ∉ Cl(CA)), then {a mathematical formula}[(B,C),I] can be added to {a mathematical formula}CA and the resulting credibility base will be sound.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that it may be the case that {a mathematical formula}(B,C) ∈ Cl(CA); nevertheless, {a mathematical formula}[(B,C),I] will be also added to {a mathematical formula}CA because the credibility of the informant agent I can increase the reliability of {a mathematical formula}(B,C).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">With this problem in mind, in the following sections we will define a change theory for credibility bases giving the agents the capability of changing the strict partial order relation that represents the trust on their peers.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The main task of a contraction operator is to obtain a new credibility base {a mathematical formula}C ′ in which {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∉ Cl(C ′ ), losing as little information as possible.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As we will show below, contraction does not mean simply removing from {a mathematical formula}C those credibility objects containing the credibility tuple {a mathematical formula}(A,B).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A particular case of expansion occurs when a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C is expanded by a credibility object {a mathematical formula}[T,A] which is already in {a mathematical formula}C. In this case, expanding {a mathematical formula}C by {a mathematical formula}[T,A] does not generate any change in {a mathematical formula}C. The name vacuity follows the tradition of belief revision literature, showing a case in which the expansion operator does not change anything.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Although our contraction operator can produce a change that is not minimal with respect to the number of credibility objects in the credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, the change is minimal as discussed in [27].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, if inconsistency arises, i.e., {a mathematical formula}(B,A) ∈ Cl(C), then the proper credibility base (no other structure is necessary) is used to decide which information prevails.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Based on a credibility base {a mathematical formula}C, we will define a function {a mathematical formula}Rl((A,B),C) that given a credibility tuple {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ Cl(C), returns a set of agent identifiers that represent the reliability of {a mathematical formula}(A,B) with respect to {a mathematical formula}C. Recall that the function Sources returns a set of agent identifiers (Definition 16) and that {a mathematical formula}C(A − B) represents the set of all paths from A to B.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The first case in Definition 18 states that when no contradiction arises the input is accepted and added (expansion).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The second case states that if a contradiction arises ({a mathematical formula}(B,A) ∈ Cl(C)) then the input will be accepted and added if every agent returned by {a mathematical formula}Rl((B,A),C) is less credible than S. The third case states that the input is rejected when there exists some agent identifier returned by Rl that is incomparable with S or more credible than S.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In contrast to their approach, in our model the reliability is not explicitly stored; thus, in our approach when the reliability of some credibility tuple is needed (in the non-prioritized revision process), the reliability function is applied.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As shown in Example 15, given a credibility tuple {a mathematical formula}(A,B), its reliability depends on the paths from A to B.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Therefore, if one of the credibility objects in these paths changes, the reliability of {a mathematical formula}(A,B) may change.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Let {a mathematical formula}(E,D) and {a mathematical formula}(G,F) be such that {a mathematical formula}C(E − D)=C(G − F).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">We need to show {a mathematical formula} Σ ↓ (C(E − D))= Σ ↓ (C(G − F)).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">It follows from {a mathematical formula}C(E − D)=C(G − F), by Proposition 6, for all subsets {a mathematical formula}C ′ of {a mathematical formula}C, {a mathematical formula}(E,D) ∈ Cl(C ′ ) if and only if {a mathematical formula}(G,F) ∈ Cl(C ′ ).</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Then, by Proposition 3, {a mathematical formula}(E,D)=(G,F).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Thus, by uniformity, {a mathematical formula}C ∩ (C ⁎ [(D,E),H])=C ∩ (C ⁎ [(F,G),I]).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Then, {a mathematical formula}C ∖ (C ⁎ [(D,E),H])=C ∖ (C ⁎ [(F,G),I]).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Therefore, by (ii), {a mathematical formula} Σ ↓ (C(E − D))= Σ ↓ (C(G − F)).2.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">{a mathematical formula} Σ ↓ (C(E − D)) ⊆ ⋃ (C(E − D)).Let {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] ∈ Σ ↓ (C(E − D)).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Following (ii), {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] ∈ C ∖ C ⁎ [(D,E),I].</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Thus, {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] ∈ C and {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] ∉ C ⁎ [(D,E),I].</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">It follows by safe retainment that {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] is not a safe element with respect to {a mathematical formula}(E,D) in {a mathematical formula}C. Then, there is some path in {a mathematical formula}C(E − D) that contains {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H].</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Hence, {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] ∈ ⋃ (C(E − D)).3.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">For each {a mathematical formula}P ∈ C(E − D), {a mathematical formula}P ∩ Σ ↓ (C(E − D)) ≠ ∅ .Let {a mathematical formula} ∅ ≠ P ∈ C(E − D), we need to show that {a mathematical formula}P ∩ Σ ↓ (C(E − D)) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">We should prove that, there exists {a mathematical formula}[T1,G] ∈ P such that {a mathematical formula}[T1,G] ∈ Σ ↓ (C(E − D)).</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Suppose {a mathematical formula}T2=(D,E).</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Since we have assumed that {a mathematical formula}C is sound, by soundness, {a mathematical formula}C ⁎ [T2,F] is a sound credibility base.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Since {a mathematical formula}P ∪ {[T2,F]} is not sound then {a mathematical formula}P ⊈ C ⁎ [T2,F] by success.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">This means that there is some {a mathematical formula}[T1,G] ∈ P and {a mathematical formula}[T1,G] ∉ C ⁎ [T2,F].</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">Since {a mathematical formula}P ⊆ C it follows that {a mathematical formula}[T1,G] ∈ (C ∖ C ⁎ [T2,F]); i.e., by (ii) {a mathematical formula}[T1,G] ∈ Σ ↓ (C(E − D)).</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">Therefore, {a mathematical formula}P ∩ Σ ↓ (C(E − D)) ≠ ∅ .4.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">If {a mathematical formula}[T1,H] ∈ Σ ↓ (C(E − D)) then {a mathematical formula} ∃ P ∈ C(D − E) such that {a mathematical formula}[T1,H] ∈ P, and for all {a mathematical formula}[T2,I] ∈ P, {a mathematical formula}(I,H) ∉ Cl(C).Suppose that {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] ∈ Σ ↓ (C(E − D)).</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Then, by (ii), {a mathematical formula}[(F,G),H] ∈ (C ∖ C ⁎ [(D,E),L]).</a>
