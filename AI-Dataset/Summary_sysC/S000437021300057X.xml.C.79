<a href="#0" id="0">Suppose the quality of the current artifact is q, we define the conditional distribution {a mathematical formula}P(q ′ |q,x) to be {a mathematical formula}Beta(10 Μ Q ′ |q,x,10(1 − Μ Q ′ |q,x)), with mean {a mathematical formula} Μ Q ′ |q,x, where{a mathematical formula} Thus, the resulting distribution of qualities is influenced by the worker ʼ s accuracy and the hardness of an improvement, indicated by the quality of the original artifact, q.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{sup:15} By introducing {a mathematical formula} Μ Qw ′ , we separate the variance in a worker ʼ s ability in improving all artifacts of the same quality from the variance in our training data, which is due to her starting out from artifacts of different qualities.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to behave optimally, AgentHunt needs to learn all Γ values, average worker error parameters {a mathematical formula} Γ ¯, and the joint workflow difficulty prior Δ , which is a part of its initial belief.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given the assumptions that all tasks share an equal level of difficulty and that workers are either always correct or randomly guess, they analytically prove the optimality of their algorithm at minimizing a budget for a target error rate with respect to any other possible algorithm using their assumptions.</a>
