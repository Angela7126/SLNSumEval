<a href="#0" id="0">An {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ argumentation theory yields an argument, A, in two cases:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ argumentation theory thus yields a set of arguments and a set of attacks, which can be considered as an abstract argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}c,b: conjecture (c – current conjecture, b – new conjecture)</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}l,k: lemma (l – current lemma, k – new lemma)</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}d,e,f,g: definitions</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}ODefinition allows Opponent to offer an alternative definition, which requires update to the AIF structure not only to include the new definition, e, but also (i) the conflict with Proponent's definition and (ii) the inference from e to Opponent's reason, s, for thinking the counterexample holds.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For StrategicWithdrawal(r, c), the revised conjecture is added to the AIF along with its conflict with the old conjecture c. (Although from a protocol perspective this is a seemingly counter-strategic move for Proponent to make, it is in fact quite common in real exchanges – see, for example, Section A.1, turn 1.)</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ argumentation theory, {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}c ‾ ′ =c ‾ ∪ {r}.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In the induced abstract framework, the conflict results in new attacks between r and the abstract argument representing the proof, Ω , i.e.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">[{a mathematical formula}li so c].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This does not remove the previous conjecture or the extant proof in its support, but suspends it, knocking it out of the grounded extension, whilst focus shifts to the revised, narrower conjecture.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For StrategicWithdrawal(r, c), the update is thus {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {(r, Ω ),(c, Ω )}.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For MonsterAdjust, a direct counter, r, to the counterexample m, is introduced along with the symmetrical conflict between them, but also a preference to ensure r defeats m. For {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+, this means that {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {r}, {a mathematical formula}m ‾ ′ =m ‾ ∪ {r} and {a mathematical formula}r ‾ ′ =r ‾ ∖ {m} (this latter is the result of the AIF PA node).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">GlobalLemmaInc, makes explicit the hidden assumption (as described by Lakatos) as a lemma (the subsequent incorporation of the lemma into the conjecture is handled by HybridLemmaInc).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The new lemma is introduced and added in to AIF and thence the {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ argumentation theory thus: {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {k}, {a mathematical formula}m ‾ ′ =m ‾ ∪ {k} and {a mathematical formula}k ‾ ′ =k ‾ ∪ {m}.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">At the abstract level, the argument corresponding to this lemma is guaranteed to be in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">That is, for GlobalLemmaInc(m, k), the update is {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {k} and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {(k, Α ),(m,k),(k,m)}, where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c].</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Next we move on to moves that reduce the size of the extant theory by introducing conflict into the AIF structure and thence the abstract framework.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">All are moves of Opponent, as is to be expected.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">First, GlobalCounter(m, c) updates the AIF to introduce not-c in conflict with the conjecture c (as well as introducing m, of course).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">This conflict introduces attacks between the abstract arguments involving c on the one hand and those involving not-c on the other [16].</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ theory is updated such that {a mathematical formula}K ′ =K ∪ {m,not − c} and {a mathematical formula}RLG ′ =RLG ∪ {m ⇒ not-c} plus {a mathematical formula}c ‾ ′ =c ‾ ∪ {not-c} and {a mathematical formula}not-c ‾ ′ =not-c ‾ ∪ {c}.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">This ensures that c is no longer in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Because the conflict is symmetrical in the AIF, there are bidirectional attacks in the abstract framework so not only is c out of the grounded extension, so too is not-c.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">This accurately reflects not only that c is knocked out of the current proof, but also that the counterposition is not added to the theory.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Instead the proof is temporarily suspended – if the dialogue were to stop at this point, there would be no proof: which is exactly the status delivered by the grounded extension of the abstract framework.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">For GlobalCounter(m, c), we have that {a mathematical formula}ARLG ′ =ARLG ∪ {m, Α } and {a mathematical formula}attacksLG ′ =attacksLG ∪ {( Ω , Α ),( Α , Ω )}, where Α is the abstract argument corresponding to the structured argumentation complex [m so not-c] and Ω corresponds to the argument [{a mathematical formula}li so c] (i.e.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">that connects all of the lemmas {a mathematical formula}li to the conjecture, c).</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">In (1-a), Proponent presents their conjecture: “ For all polyhedra, {a mathematical formula}V − E+F=2 ” , this corresponds to the Conjecture(C) move in the LG protocol governed by the locution rule L1.1 and structural rule S1.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">The current state of proof consists now of the conjecture C which adds {a mathematical formula}I1, a first node, to the AIF structure depicted on the left hand side in Fig.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">14.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">This also adds C as an argument to the {a mathematical formula}ASPIC+ framework, and to the abstract argumentation framework.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">As there are no conflicts at this stage, C is in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">The next three moves (1-b), (1-c), and (1-d), present the three lemmas that the Proponent is using to support their conjecture (the full text of these lemmas can be seen in Table 2).</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">This introduces three lemmas {a mathematical formula}L1, {a mathematical formula}L2, {a mathematical formula}L3 into dialogue theory, and three new nodes {a mathematical formula}I2, {a mathematical formula}I3, {a mathematical formula}I4 into AIF structure and argumentation framework in Fig.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">14.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">The counter begins in (1-f), following the rules L2.3 and S4.1, the Opponent uses GlobalCounter to introduce the counterexample of a hollow cube (i.e.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">{a mathematical formula}M1 or {a mathematical formula}I5): “ For the hollow cube {a mathematical formula}V − E+F=4 ” , to the conjecture “ For all polyhedra, {a mathematical formula}V − E+F=2 ” (thus new conflict nodes {a mathematical formula}CA1 and {a mathematical formula}CA2 in the updated AIF structure in Fig.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">15).</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">More specifically, they use this counterexample as a premise to justify ({a mathematical formula}RA2) the counter-conjecture (not-C, {a mathematical formula}I6): “ It is not the case that for all polyhedra, {a mathematical formula}V − E+F=2 ” .</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">This results in the creation of a new abstract argument in Fig.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">15, Α , which is in mutual conflict with the abstract argument, Ω , representing the proposed proof, and hence Ω is no longer in the grounded extension.</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Having introduced the revised lemma, K, the Proponent now performs the ProofDone move to incorporate this new lemma into the proof structure.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">The result of this move is to create a new rule of inference, {a mathematical formula}RA6, between the current lemmas ({a mathematical formula}L1, {a mathematical formula}L2, K) and the conjecture (C), this produces a new abstract argument {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ , which replaces Ω as the current proof (Fig.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">21).</a>
