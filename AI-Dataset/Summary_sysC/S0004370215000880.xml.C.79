<a href="#0" id="0">For strict preferences, a weak SD proportional discrete assignment exists if and only if one of two cases holds:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}m=nand it is possible to allocate to each agent an object that is not his least preferred object;{a mathematical formula}m>n.Moreover, it can be checked in polynomial time whether a weak SD proportional discrete assignment exists when agents have strict preferences.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A weak SD proportional discrete assignment exists if and only if a feasible b-matching exists for the graph corresponding to at least one of the {a mathematical formula} ∏ i=1n(ki+1) combinations of conditions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since {a mathematical formula} ∏ i=1n(ki+1) is polynomial if n is a constant and since a feasible b-matching can be checked in strongly polynomial time, we can check the existence of a weak SD proportional discrete assignment in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It can be checked in polynomial time whether a discrete{a mathematical formula}1/ Α proportional assignment exists even if agents are allowed to express indifference between objects.The algorithm and proof is identical to that of the algorithm in the proof of Theorem 6.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The algorithm in the proof of Theorem 16 can be used to check the existence of a {a mathematical formula}1/ Α proportional assignment for different values of Α .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, among other cases, if {a mathematical formula}m<n, then we know that a {a mathematical formula}1/ Α proportional assignment does not exist for any finite value of Α .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We first characterize the settings that admit a {a mathematical formula}1/ Α proportional assignment for some finite Α .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For a constant number of agents, it can be checked in polynomial time whether a{a mathematical formula}1/ Β weak proportional discrete assignment exists even if agents are allowed to express indifference between objects.The algorithm and proof is identical to that of the algorithm in the proof of Theorem 8.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The algorithm in the proof of Theorem 19 can be used to check the existence of a {a mathematical formula}1/ Β weak proportional assignment for different values of Β .</a>
