<a href="#1" id="1">A feature assembly method is proposed that uses constraint conditions to generate combined features for capturing local dependency information.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A feature assembly method is developed to explore the utilization of combined features for Chinese and English relation extraction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Rows 1, 2, and 3 compare the performance of the segmented feature ({a mathematical formula}F(Seg_B)), the n-gram feature ({a mathematical formula}F(N_B)), and the omni-word feature ({a mathematical formula}F(O_B)), respectively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Row 1 shows that when utilizing other candidate features, the segmentation-based feature with the bin constraint also performed well and it even outperformed the omni-word feature with 6 relation types.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This result is interesting because Table 4 shows that without other candidate features, the omni-word feature outperformed the segmentation-based method by 7.43% with 6 types and by 10.61% with 18 subtypes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Row 4 shows the performance when all of the candidate features were used as singleton features, which indicates that the performance decreased considerably, thereby demonstrating that the lack of local dependency information for relation extraction can degrade the performance.</a>
