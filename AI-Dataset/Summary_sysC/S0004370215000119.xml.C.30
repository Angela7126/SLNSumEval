<a href="#0" id="0">The core is non-empty only for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ for standard coalitional games [2], i.e., AC contains all possible coalitions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From this definition, it is clear that if the weak Ε -core is non-empty for one coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CSA, it is also non-empty for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Similar to the core, we can show that there will be no blocking coalition structure, and the following theorem holds:</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is sufficient to show that if the weak Ε -core{sup:+} is non-empty, the weak Ε -core for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ is non-empty.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assume the weak Ε -core{sup:+} is non-empty.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The least value Ε of the weak least core for the optimal coalition structure is equivalent to that of the weak least{a mathematical formula}core+.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The weak nucleolus for the optimal coalition structure is in the weak least{a mathematical formula}core+, as well as in the weak least core for the optimal coalition structure.</a>
