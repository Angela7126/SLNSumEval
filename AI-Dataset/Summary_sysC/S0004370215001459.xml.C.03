<a href="#0" id="0">When concept drift occurs, past cases may not reflect current concepts; as a consequence, current case-base editing methods may preserve harmful cases.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For competence preservation, we invent a Stepwise Redundancy Removal (SRR) algorithm that uniformly removes superfluous cases without loss of case-base competence.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">They extended Smyth's competence model [30] to include the liability set and proposed a Blame-Based Noise Reduction (BBNR) algorithm which reviews all cases that have contributed to misclassifications and removes a case if its deletion results in no loss of coverage.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Other approaches to case editing build a competence model of the training data and use the competence properties of the cases to determine which cases to include in the edited set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This phenomenon can be caused by outdated cases when concept drift occurs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Referring to an ill-matched competence model may lead to the mistaken preservation of noisy cases, i.e., if we have previously removed a noisy case {a mathematical formula}c ′ that happens to be a member of the coverage set c that we are currently considering.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our NEFCS method takes the results of competence-based change detection as input (whether there is a concept drift, and the identified competence area in which concept drift is detected), and aims to continuously improve the learning capability.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">{a mathematical formula} only when c lies out of any identified concept drift competence area (i.e.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If there is concept drift and c lies in the identified concept drift competence areas (Definition.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For each case {a mathematical formula}c ∈ NCB, if it is in one identified concept drift competence area corresponding to {a mathematical formula}p1, that is, there is a certain {a mathematical formula}r ∈ ℜ p1 so that {a mathematical formula}c ∈ r, then this case must be in one identified concept drift competence area corresponding to {a mathematical formula}p2 as well, since {a mathematical formula}r ∈ ℜ p2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The conditional BBNR rule imposes an additional condition on BBNR rule [5], i.e., any new case c will only be considered as noise and removed by the BBNR rule if c lies outside an identified concept drift competence area (does not represent a new concept).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">When working with other change detection methods which have no capacity to locate concept drifts, all new cases will be exempt from removal, which is also the case when {a mathematical formula}p=0 in Definition 8.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Moreover, any case of the later window will be excluded from this list when there is concept drift if it lies in the identified competence area.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">A major difference between SRR and other deletion-based competence preservation methods is that SRR recursively removes redundant cases in a competently uniform way, which we believe is more suitable for the concept drift problem.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A case c will be removed if c and all cases in the linked list (kL) of c can still be correctly solved without c. When c is removed, the closest {a mathematical formula}(k+1)/2 cases that solve c are locked and linked to c. {a mathematical formula}(k+1)/2 is chosen as the number of cases to lock because it is the minimum number of cases required to secure a correct classification of c, therefore no case-base competence will be lost by discarding c. In addition, each case {a mathematical formula}ci ′ in the kL of c will be added to the kL of the closest {a mathematical formula}(k+1)/2 cases that solve {a mathematical formula}ci ′ .</a>
