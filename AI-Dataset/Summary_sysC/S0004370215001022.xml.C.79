<a href="#0" id="0">The formulation allows {a mathematical formula}K=N in which case the set of possible solutions to the quadratic program exactly matches the set of possible solutions to the integer linear programming formulation of correlation clustering and our general definition of correlation clustering (recall Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a symmetric similarity matrix W over a set V of data points (recall Section 2.1), the basic idea behind all of our MaxSAT formulations of correlation clustering is that hard clauses are used to enforce that any solution to the MaxSAT instance represents a well-defined clustering (i.e., a mapping {a mathematical formula}cl:V → N).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While the notion of producing good clusterings under inconsistent advice first appeared in [11], the formal definition of correlation clustering was proposed in [4] and shown to be NP-hard on complete graphs with each edge labeled with + or − ; or, in terms of the general problem definition considered in this work, on symmetric similarity matrices W where {a mathematical formula}W(i,j)={ − 1,1} for all i and j. NP-hardness motivated early work on approximative algorithms for the problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a similarity matrix W over a set of data points {a mathematical formula}V={v1, … ,vN}, minimizing disagreements refers to minimizing the number of point pairs {a mathematical formula}vi, {a mathematical formula}vj whose cluster assignment does not agree with their similarity value {a mathematical formula}W(i,j), or more precisely, to finding a clustering cl minimizing{a mathematical formula} Maximizing agreements refers to maximizing the number of pairs of points {a mathematical formula}vi, {a mathematical formula}vj whose cluster assignment agrees with their similarity value {a mathematical formula}W(i,j), or more precisely, to finding a clustering cl maximizing{a mathematical formula} Maximizing correlation refers to maximizing the difference between agreements and disagreements, i.e., using the objective function obtained by substracting Equation (7) from Equation (8).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Restricting the correlation clustering problem search space to clusterings only containing two clusters, the quadratic program in Equation (4) (recall Section 4) can be formulated equivalently as{a mathematical formula} where N is the number of data points, and the value in the solution of the variable {a mathematical formula}zi indicates whether point {a mathematical formula}vi is assigned to cluster 1 or − 1.</a>
