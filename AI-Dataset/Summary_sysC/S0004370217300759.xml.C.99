<a href="#0" id="0">1 ({a mathematical formula}p ∧ ¬K1p is true in states t and v).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">More technically, the “ problem ” is due to the compositional semantics of modal logic: in the evaluation of {a mathematical formula}DG Φ , the {a mathematical formula}DG operator picks out a number of states considered possible by the group G (the states considered possible by all members of the group), and then Φ is evaluated in each of these states in the original model, without any effect of the{a mathematical formula}DGoperator.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An epistemic model over prop and ag (or just a model) is a tuple {a mathematical formula}M=(S, ∼ ,V) where S is a set of states (or worlds), {an inline-figure} associates a set of states {a mathematical formula}V(p) with each propositional variable p, and ∼ is a function that maps each agent to a binary equivalence relation on S. We write {a mathematical formula} ∼ i for {a mathematical formula} ∼ (i).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Considering the distributed knowledge of a group G – a key concept in the following – we define a derived relation {a mathematical formula} ∼ G= ⋂ i ∈ G ∼ i (it is easy to see that {a mathematical formula} ∼ G is an equivalence relation).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A similar relation modeling the common knowledge of a group is obtained by taking the transitive closure of the union of the individual relations: {a mathematical formula} ∼ CG=( ⋃ i ∈ G ∼ i) ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We will also be interested in {a mathematical formula}PACD, the language for public announcement logic with both common knowledge and distributed knowledge, in later sections, when we compare relative expressive power.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Validity is defined as usual: ⊨ Φ means that {a mathematical formula}M,m ⊨ Φ for all {a mathematical formula}M and m.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The interpretation of these languages in a pointed model is defined as usual, with the following additional clause for the resolution operator:{a mathematical formula} where the definition of {a mathematical formula}M|G is given at the beginning this section.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}For the † step, note that when {a mathematical formula}i ∈ G, {a mathematical formula}( ∼ |G)i=( ∼ |G)j for any {a mathematical formula}j ∈ G (and actually also equal to {a mathematical formula} ∼ G).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore,{a mathematical formula}That {a mathematical formula}RGKi Φ ↔ DGRG Φ is valid is already given in Proposition 7.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">However, this does not hold for overlapping groups G and H. In general, we have that (see the proof of the proposition above) {a mathematical formula}M,s ⊨ RGCH Φ iff {a mathematical formula}M|G,t ⊨ Φ for any {a mathematical formula}(s,t) ∈ ∼ H ⁎ ′ , where {a mathematical formula} ∼ H ⁎ ′ =( ⋂ i ∈ G ∼ i ∪ ⋃ i ∈ H ∖ G ∼ i) ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Then,{a mathematical formula}where Θ is the union of all{a mathematical formula}Gxsuch that{a mathematical formula}i ∈ Gx, i.e.,{a mathematical formula} Θ = ⋃ {Gx|i ∈ Gx}.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As we see from the previous section, the reduction axioms for individual knowledge and distributed knowledge both contain two distinct cases, and the principles of iterated resolution become more complicated.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We simply write Δ instead of {a mathematical formula} Δ (H,G → ) when its parameters are clear in the context.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">From the discussion in the previous section we immediately get that any formula in the {a mathematical formula}RD language is equivalent to a formula without resolution operators: even though we do not have a reduction axiom for iterated resolution operators, we can do the reduction “ inside-out ” , starting with the innermost {a mathematical formula}RG operator, working outwards, eventually getting rid of all the resolution operators.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The relative expressivity of {a mathematical formula}RCD and {a mathematical formula}ELCD is not as simple to settle: that we did not find a reduction axiom for the {a mathematical formula}RGCH case in the previous section does not imply that one does not exist.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The language {a mathematical formula}RCD contains only two more types of formulas than {a mathematical formula}ELCD: {a mathematical formula}R{i} Φ and {a mathematical formula}R{i,j} Φ .</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">By Proposition 6, {a mathematical formula}R{i} Φ is reducible to Φ .</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">As for {a mathematical formula}R{i,j} Φ , by Proposition 8 and the reduction principles (Lemma 7), it is always possible to push the {a mathematical formula}R{i,j}-operator further outwards and finally remove it, which gives an equivalent {a mathematical formula}ELCD-formula.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The modal degree (or simply degree) of Φ , denoted {a mathematical formula}md( Φ ), is defined inductively as follows:{a mathematical formula} Given a sublanguage {a mathematical formula}L and a natural number n, we write {a mathematical formula}Ln for all {a mathematical formula}L-formulas of degree up to and including n.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">While the first four moves are defined the same as in Definition 18, the last is defined as follows: {a mathematical formula}[ Φ ]-moveSpoiler chooses a number {a mathematical formula}r ′ <r, and sets {a mathematical formula}N ⊆ M and {a mathematical formula}N ′ ⊆ M ′ such that {a mathematical formula}s ∈ N and {a mathematical formula}s ′ ∈ N ′ .</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">We now, first, formally define pseudo models as a slight generalization of (proper) models, and their interpretation of the language, before we define the finite canonical pseudo model.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The central result is a truth lemma for the canonical pseudo model (Lemma 41), from which we can get the completeness result relatively easily.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The satisfaction of a formula Φ in a pointed pseudo model {a mathematical formula}(M,s), {a mathematical formula}(M,s) ⊨ Φ , is defined exactly as for (proper) models, with two exceptions.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">First, for the interpretation of the {a mathematical formula}DG operators,{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} ∼ G is given directly by the model rather than being defined as the intersection of individual equivalence relations.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Second, for the interpretation of the {a mathematical formula}RG operators,{a mathematical formula} the updated pseudo model {a mathematical formula}M|G=(S, ∽ |G,V) is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} It is easy to see that the updated pseudo model {a mathematical formula}M|G is indeed a pseudo model.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Moreover, for any model {a mathematical formula}M we write {a mathematical formula}M|G → for {a mathematical formula}M|G1| ⋯ |Gn, and for the second element ∼ of a model, we write {a mathematical formula} ∼ |G → for {a mathematical formula} ∼ |G1| ⋯ |Gn.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The canonical pseudo model{a mathematical formula}Mc=(S, ∽ ,V) for {a mathematical formula}cl( Α ) is defined as follows (where the standard definition of maximal consistency in a finite set of formulas is used):</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">By Lemma 40(1), {a mathematical formula} Γ _ ∧ D ˆ Δ ⋁ ¬RG → Ψ ∈ Θ ∈ S Θ _ is consistent.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Since conjunction, resolution and the {a mathematical formula}D ˆ Δ -operator all distribute over disjunction, {a mathematical formula} ⋁ ¬RG → Ψ ∈ Θ ∈ S( Γ _ ∧ D ˆ Δ Θ _) is consistent.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Therefore there must be a {a mathematical formula} Θ ∈ S such that {a mathematical formula}¬RG → Ψ ∈ Θ and {a mathematical formula} Γ _ ∧ D ˆ Δ Θ _ is consistent.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">From {a mathematical formula}¬RG → Ψ ∈ Θ we get {a mathematical formula}RG → Ψ ∉ Θ .</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">By the induction hypothesis {a mathematical formula}Mc|G → , Θ ⊭ Ψ , and so {a mathematical formula}Mc, Θ ⊭ RG → Ψ .</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">By Lemma 40(5) and the fact that {a mathematical formula} Γ _ ∧ D ˆ Δ Θ _ is consistent, {a mathematical formula} Γ ∽ Δ Θ .</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">But this contradicts the supposition that {a mathematical formula}Mc|G → , Γ ⊨ Ki Ψ , since by the same reasoning as in the proof of the other direction (see above), {a mathematical formula}Mc, Δ ⊨ RG → Ψ for all Δ such that {a mathematical formula} Γ ∽ Δ Δ .</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">The case for distributed knowledge: similar to the case for individual knowledge, and in the proof we use {a mathematical formula} Δ (H,G → ) instead of {a mathematical formula} Δ ({i},G → ).</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">From the pseudo truth lemma we get that any consistent formula is satisfied in a pseudo model.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">For the completeness result, it remains to be shown that there is a truth-preserving transformation of canonical pseudo models to (proper) models.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">These methods have to be slightly modified to deal with our language instead of {a mathematical formula}PACD, in particular showing that a suitable notion of bisimulation between pseudo models and proper models (called trans-bisimulation in [38]) preserves truth of the {a mathematical formula}RCD language, but this is straightforward and we omit the details here.</a>
