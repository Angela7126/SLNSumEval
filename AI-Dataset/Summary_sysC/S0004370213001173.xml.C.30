<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we advocate a change in focus to actors as the primary topic of investigation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Actors are not mere plan executors: they may use planning and other deliberation tools, before and during acting.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This change in focus entails two interconnected principles: a hierarchical structure to integrate the actor ʼ s deliberation functions, and continual online planning and reasoning throughout the acting process.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the paper, we discuss open problems and research directions toward that objective in knowledge representations, model acquisition and verification, synthesis and refinement, monitoring, goal reasoning, and integration.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We are proposing to focus on the representations, modeling and reasoning techniques that a deliberate actor needs in order to perform various tasks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our actor may use several planning and decision-making techniques as well as other computational tools, both before and while acting.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our proposed focus concerns automated planning integrated with these other reasoning tools: a focus that enriches the field with a number of research challenges and allows it to address significantly more relevant problems for real-world applications.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In order to be chosen and carried out, all these steps require prediction, but possibly with different representations and models.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Some of these steps need refinement into lower level steps (e.g., take the train), possibly using different planning techniques, others are primitives that the actor manages without explicit reasoning (e.g., sitting once at the seat).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Each action in a plan may be a task that may need further refinement and planning, which will usually be done online (see below) and may require different representations, tools, and techniques from the ones that generated the task.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Such a hierarchical deliberation process differs significantly from hierarchical planning techniques (e.g., HTN planning) for reducing the search complexity of offline, non-heterogeneous plan generation.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Indeed, given the advances of automated planning, the hard research issues are now precisely at the actor ʼ s level, rather than at the planner ʼ s level.</a>
