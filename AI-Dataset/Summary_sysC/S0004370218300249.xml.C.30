<a href="#0" id="0">The process of constructing models of other agents, sometimes referred to as agent modelling or opponent modelling,{sup:2} often involves some form of learning since the model may be based on information observed from the current interaction and possibly data collected in past interactions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, an agent may model another agent's decision making as a deterministic finite automaton and learn the parameters of the automaton (e.g.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Goals are said to be common if they are identical for all agents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Many modelling methods that attempt to predict an agent's actions are unaffected by the goals of the agents, since such methods primarily work on observed actions (cf.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, Ganzfried and Sandholm [111] first compute a Nash equilibrium solution for the game which specifies action distributions for each information set and agent.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This solution can be used to initialise the agent models.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">During play, the distributions in the models are gradually shifted toward the observed action frequencies of the modelled agents, to reflect their true behaviours.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The advantage of this method is that the modelling agent can initially plan its actions against a rational (Nash) opponent model, rather than starting with an arbitrary model.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Based on the above intuition, type-based reasoning methods assume that the modelled agent has one of several known types.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Each type is a complete specification (a model) of the agent's behaviour, taking as input the observed interaction history and assigning probabilities to the actions available to the modelled agent.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For example, learning-based methods for policy reconstruction are usually restricted by the structure of the model (e.g.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">decision trees, finite state automata) but do not tell the modelling agent if the model structure is even capable of capturing an agent's behaviour.</a>
