<a href="#0" id="0">Source instances {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ are indistinguishable for an ontology {a mathematical formula}O and mappings {a mathematical formula}M if, for every CQ q over the global schema, the certain answers to q over {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D) and {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D ′ ) coincide.The associated decision problem for an ontology language {a mathematical formula}O and mapping language {a mathematical formula}M is defined as follows, where {a mathematical formula}O ranges over {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M over {a mathematical formula}M: {an inline-figure} is true if and only if {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ are indistinguishable for {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M. We consider not only the combined complexity of {an inline-figure}, but also its data complexity — that is, the complexity under assumption that {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M are fixed, while only {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ form the input.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Furthermore, {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D)complies to a policy {a mathematical formula}p(x) with m free variables x if it complies to {a mathematical formula}p(a) for all m-tuples a of constants from {a mathematical formula}D.The associated decision problem for an ontology language {a mathematical formula}O, mapping language {a mathematical formula}M, and policy language {a mathematical formula}P is defined as follows, where {a mathematical formula}O ranges over {a mathematical formula}O, {a mathematical formula}M over {a mathematical formula}M, and p over {a mathematical formula}P: {an inline-figure} is true if and only if {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D) complies to p. Data complexity of the compliance problem assumes that all {a mathematical formula}O, {a mathematical formula}M and p are fixed, while only {a mathematical formula}D forms the input.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this case the notions of compliance and strong compliance coincide, and therefore the reductions show {an inline-figure}-hardness of {an inline-figure} as well.We start with the definition of the source schema: let it consist of unary relational names {a mathematical formula}Zero, {a mathematical formula}One and {a mathematical formula}Tiledt for each {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T, as well as binary relational names {a mathematical formula}HBiti and {a mathematical formula}VBiti for each i such that {a mathematical formula}n ≥ i ≥ 1.Then, let source instance {a mathematical formula}D consist of the following facts over constants 0, 1, and e:{a mathematical formula}Let now the target schema consists of relational names {a mathematical formula}HValidi and {a mathematical formula}VValidi, with {a mathematical formula}n ≥ i ≥ 1, all with arity 3n.We next construct {a mathematical formula}M. For the sake of readability, we allow for (safe) equalities of variables in the bodies of mappings, which clearly does not add any power to the language and can be eliminated by a polynomial transformation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}TM extend {a mathematical formula}M with the inverse mapping{a mathematical formula}R(x) → ∃ z. Φ (x,z) for each mapping {a mathematical formula} Φ (x,z) → R(x) in {a mathematical formula}M. The following claim relates the compliance problems studied in [7] to those in our paper for the particular case where the input mappings are CQ views.For a set of constant-free CQ views{a mathematical formula}M, source instance{a mathematical formula}D, and constant-free Boolean policy p,{an inline-figure}istrueif and only if{an inline-figure}istrue.For the forward direction, suppose {a mathematical formula}D ′ witnesses {an inline-figure} — that is, {a mathematical formula}D ′ is indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}D for {a mathematical formula}M and satisfies ¬p.</a>
