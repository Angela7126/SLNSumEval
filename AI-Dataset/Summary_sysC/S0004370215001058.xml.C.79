<a href="#0" id="0">However, for a given chance constraint h, T is clearly less than or equal to the cardinality {a mathematical formula}Ah of the assignment space constrained by h. {a mathematical formula}Ah can be computed as the cartesian product of the domains of the decision variables in the policy tree that are constrained by h. Since the property discussed in Proposition 5 applies to each chance constraint {a mathematical formula}h ∈ C, to compute an {a mathematical formula}( Α , Θ )-solution set we may introduce the following Bonferroni's correction [16], which is free of correlation and distribution assumptions, while computing N.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Section 8.4 we will generate approximate ({a mathematical formula} Α , Θ )-solution sets using Definition 7 for the first two problems and show numerically that, with probability greater than or equal to Α , the approach we discussed generates solution sets that satisfy chance constraints in the model with a margin of error Θ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By introducing the two concepts of ({a mathematical formula} Α , Θ )-solution and ({a mathematical formula} Α , Θ )-solution set, we suggest that a decision maker may — in line with established practices in statistics — interpret Θ as an error tolerance threshold and fix a priori, together with the confidence level Α , either the sample size (on the basis of the available observations) or Θ (on the basis of the estimation error that can be tolerated); finally, the parameter that has not been fixed should be derived via the analysis we presented.</a>
