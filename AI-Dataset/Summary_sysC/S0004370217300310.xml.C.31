<a href="#0" id="0">The early promise of the impact of machine intelligence did not involve the partitioning of the nascent field of Artificial Intelligence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The founders of AI envisioned the notion of embedded intelligence as being conjoined between perception, reasoning and actuation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Yet over the years the fields of AI and Robotics drifted apart.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This special issue on “ AI and Robotics ” provides one such venue, presenting a carefully selected set of successful integration efforts.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is our hope that it will constitute an important stepping stone in building a community of AI and Robotics researchers working across their traditional boundaries towards an ultimately shared scientific goal, thus setting the stage for a new science of integrated AI and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The matrix in Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">1 gives structure to the research landscape in the field of integrated AI and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We believe that it is the research questions at the intersections of the rows and columns in this matrix that characterize this field.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Coming with a well-defined set of such questions would be an important first step to define a much needed science of integrated AI and Robotics.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The papers in this Special Issue contribute to this process, by addressing an interesting sample of questions across such a landscape.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Regarding the coverage of topics, while no outcome or expectations was designed by the guest editors, we were delighted to note that the end result is both broad and deep with respect to the landscape introduced in the previous section, as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">4.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{sup:6} The 18 contributions to this special issue illustrate how AI methods and techniques addressing a given cognitive ability can be extended to address some of our four robotic challenges.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">While such a categorization is subjective, we feel it reflects the cross-disciplinary nature of this Special Issue and provides the AI generalist with a broad overview of what is clearly a re-emergent and symbiotic field.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Six of the contributions in this Special Issue have the acquisition or representation of knowledge as their center of gravity.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">These are highlighted in blue in Fig.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">4.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Finally, [6] discusses how one can structure a knowledge base for robots for goal achievement that combines different knowledge types, thus addressing RC4.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The authors propose a combination of different knowledge areas, different knowledge sources and different inference mechanisms to cover the breadth and depth of required knowledge and inferences.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Various methods have been developed in the AI community for representing and reasoning about temporal relations, action effects and changing situations, most of them focusing on individual inference problems.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">On the other end, representations developed in robotics have largely focused on special-purpose probabilistic models that usually lack clear semantics.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">This paper attempts to combine parts of these approaches in a common framework to provide robots with comprehensive knowledge and inference capabilities.</a>
