<a href="#0" id="0">In the first model, agents interact concurrently in multiple social networks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We compare these models and analyse the influence of different social networks regarding the speed of convergence to consensus.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We look at how the properties of different network models influence the convergence to opinion consensus.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the next section, we present the work related to opinion dynamics, social space modelling and complex network models.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These are designed to study the notion of context permeability and consensus formation in multiple social networks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this section, we present work related to opinion dynamics, social space modelling, and complex network models.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We use multiple social networks to represent the complex social space in which an agent is inserted.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The social context of an agent is thus a set of neighbours currently available for interaction at a particular network or set of networks.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We study the notion of context permeability in different simulation models in which agents interact using a simple consensus game.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Agents switch contexts with a probability {a mathematical formula} Ζ Ci associated with context {a mathematical formula}Ci: this switching probability is the same for every agent in a given network.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This model describes an abstract way to represent the time spent on each network using the switching probability {a mathematical formula} Ζ Ci.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The social networks used in our models are k-regular and scale-free.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Adding more networks to the social space is not the same as creating a single network with twice the number of connections.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">2, that the distance between nodes in the network has decreased, this is also confirmed by the reduced average path length of the combined networks (see Table 1).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">To illustrate our point, we analysed one k-regular network with {a mathematical formula}k=20 (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">4 shows the average value for the average path length of 100 k-regular network instances (each with 100 nodes).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We can then say that specific configurations display a specific average path length and clustering coefficient both for k-regular networks and scale-free networks.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Scale-free networks also have a reduced clustering coefficient (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Finally, we look at what happens when we merge k-regular networks with scale-free networks.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">7 that this results in a network with a lower average path length due to the shortcuts created by the scale-free network.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">8 shows the average path length of 100 independently generated instances of combinations of one k-regular network and one scale-free network with different values k and d respectively.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">These are similar to the results we get for k-regular networks (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">This happens due to the position of agents in the network and their initial opinion values.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The convergence ratio is very low for the configurations with one network {a mathematical formula}d=2 and 2 networks with {a mathematical formula}d=1; hence the high number of encounters (see also Table 3).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">This happens because with {a mathematical formula}k=1 the network is basically a ring and has the maximum possible average path length for a connected graph.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">The difference between this model and the previous one is that the agents no longer interact in multiple networks at the same time (being able to select any neighbour at a given simulation step).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The same can be observed when we mix k-regular with scale-free networks (see Fig.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">We took the average number of encounters during the simulations to compare the context switching model with the context permeability model.</a>
