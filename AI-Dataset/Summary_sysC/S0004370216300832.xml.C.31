<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we propose a number of new ideas for local search for PMS, which mainly rely on the distinction between hard and soft clauses.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The three ideas mentioned above are used in developing a local search algorithm for PMS dubbed Dist, as it makes effective use of Distinctions between hard and soft clauses.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Results of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2014 as well as our experiments show that Dist significantly outperforms previous local search solvers on all benchmarks from the MaxSAT Evaluation 2014, with a remarkable improvement in terms of the number of “ winning ” instances on structured PMS benchmarks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also compare Dist with latest state-of-the-art complete solvers and a state-of-the-art portfolio solver on PMS benchmarks from the MaxSAT Evaluation 2014.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Experimental results show that Dist outperforms the complete solvers on random and crafted benchmarks, while its performance on industrial instances is still considerably worse than complete solvers.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Most local search algorithms for SAT and MaxSAT problems utilize the variable property {a mathematical formula}score, which measures the increase of the number (or total weight) of satisfied clauses caused by flipping a variable x.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Previous local search algorithms for PMS also utilize the {a mathematical formula}score property to pick variables.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this work, however, we propose to separate hard score and soft score, which allows us to make better use of the special structure of PMS and thus design more efficient local search algorithms for PMS.</a>
