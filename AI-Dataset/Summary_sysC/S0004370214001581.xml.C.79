<a href="#1" id="1">Focusing on the structure of {a mathematical formula}CG Π B, let {a mathematical formula}RB-PlanExist(G) and {a mathematical formula}RB-PlanGen(G) be respectively the plan existence and plan generation problems restricted to {a mathematical formula}RB planning tasks whose black causal graphs are elements of{a mathematical formula}G. Note that these problems put no restriction on the structure of the causal graph itself beyond being a super-graph of some element of {a mathematical formula}G. Theorem 5 below refines the complexity characterization for {a mathematical formula}RB with respect to the structure of the black causal graph, providing a valuable fragment of tractability via Theorem 1, and establishing {a mathematical formula}P/NPdichotomies for both general {a mathematical formula}RB, as well as for {a mathematical formula}RB restricted to fixed-size domain variables.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">6 terminates immediately and we get a single call of {a mathematical formula}Achieve(g), on the original goal.Assume for the moment that, in {a mathematical formula}Achieve(g), we would be using a simpler construction {a mathematical formula} Π B with only the black variables, and not including the actions {a mathematical formula}A(DTG Π (v)|R ∪ B ← ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is a benign kind of red – black planning task though, because its black causal graph is acyclic, there aren't any goals on the red variables, and for each black DTG we know that (a) from our initial position we can reach all values, and (b) once we traversed any arc {a mathematical formula}(d,d ′ ) we will have the red outside conditions required for at least one inverse arc {a mathematical formula}(d ′ ,d).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this special case, the planning tasks solved inside {a mathematical formula}Achieve(g) are trivial: All black variables v are completely independent, and it suffices to find a DTG path from v's current value to {a mathematical formula}g[v] (if defined) for each v individually.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The main choice points are (i) selecting actions {a mathematical formula}a ∈ A0 in the while loop (pertains to red facts following), and (ii) selecting DTG paths for black variables in the solution to {a mathematical formula} Π B, i.e., inside {a mathematical formula}Achieve(g) (pertains to both, red facts following and relaxed plan repair).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Plan existence for{a mathematical formula}RBtasks with a fixed number of black variables is{a mathematical formula}NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Calling {a mathematical formula}Achieve(G[VB]) (if needed), as we will show the {a mathematical formula}FDR task {a mathematical formula} Π B constructed will again have properties (i) – (iii), so it is solvable and appending its solution will turn Π into a plan for our {a mathematical formula}RB task Π .Regarding (i), we need to show that all variable values occurring in {a mathematical formula} Π B are indeed members of the respective variable domains, i.e., the reduced domains {a mathematical formula}DB(v) for black variables v. This is obvious for {a mathematical formula}IB.</a>
