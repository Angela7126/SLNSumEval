<a href="#1" id="1">However, solution pruning power is not affected by the above case.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given the same set of symmetries.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Symmetry breaking constraints added by ParSBDS but not by ReSBDS cannot prune solutions when both use the same static variable and value orderings.Consider the resulting search trees {a mathematical formula} ϒ P of ParSBDS and {a mathematical formula} ϒ R of ReSBDS.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Suppose a constraint c is added at a node {a mathematical formula}P0 by ParSBDS in {a mathematical formula} ϒ P due to the backtracking from node {a mathematical formula}P1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Constraint c cannot be added or implied by the constraints added by ReSBDS in {a mathematical formula} ϒ R only when (a) {a mathematical formula}P0 is in {a mathematical formula} ϒ R but {a mathematical formula}P1 is not, (b) {a mathematical formula}P1 is pruned by a problem constraint and (c) this pruned assignment is not recorded into T. Since {a mathematical formula}P1 is pruned by problem constraint in {a mathematical formula} ϒ R, no solutions exist in the subtree of {a mathematical formula}P1 in {a mathematical formula} ϒ P.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus c cannot prune any symmetric solutions.</a>
