<a href="#0" id="0">As well-known, {a mathematical formula}SROIQ-RL knowledge bases can be expressed in first-order (FO) logic [26], where every axiom {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ L Σ is translated into an equivalent FO sentence {a mathematical formula} ∀ x. Φ Α (x) where x contains all free variables of {a mathematical formula} Φ Α depending on the type of the axiom (see below).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">With the characterization of justified clashing assumptions at hand, we can devise a refutation algorithm for {a mathematical formula}K ⊨ c: Α resp.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{a mathematical formula}K ⊨ Α that finds a justified CAS-model {a mathematical formula}ICAS of {a mathematical formula}K in which the query does not hold.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As the axiom Α amounts to a universal sentence {a mathematical formula} ∀ x. Φ Α (x) resp.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula} ∀ x. Φ Α (x,c), it is sufficient to consider named models relative to the individual constants in {a mathematical formula}K and fresh (Skolem) constants for the negated query.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To this end, we let S consist of (a) all positive atomic assertions Β such that {a mathematical formula}I ˆ (x) ⊨ Β where {a mathematical formula}I ˆ K( Χ , Ν )=(M ˆ ,I ˆ , Χ ), and Β is over N, where N are the constants of the named part,{sup:13} and (b) all negative atomic assertions ¬ Β over N such that {a mathematical formula}I ˆ K Β ,c( Χ , Ν ) does not exist (i.e., no CAS-model {a mathematical formula}ICAS= 〈 M ′ ,I ′ , Χ 〉 with name assignment Ν exists such that {a mathematical formula}I ′ (x) ⊨ Β ).It is easy to see that S is satisfiable, and it follows from the proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 that S is moreover a clashing set for {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ,e 〉 iff some clashing set {a mathematical formula}S 〈 Α ,e 〉 {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α ,e 〉 exists, and that S includes some irredundant (minimal) clashing set {a mathematical formula}S ′ of size linear in the size of Α ; thus we can restrict the candidates Β resp.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Furthermore, he presented – exploiting a normal form of axioms – a fixed datalog program that gives a universal encoding of the proof systems associated with concrete DL knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K, where {a mathematical formula}K and the instance query are represented by a set of facts.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example, for axioms of the form {a mathematical formula}D(A ⊑ B), the following overriding rule is added to the local programs:{a mathematical formula} Intuitively, this rule states that, if {a mathematical formula}y=A is included in {a mathematical formula}z=B by a defeasible global axiom ({a mathematical formula}def_subclass(y,z)) and in context c we can prove for {a mathematical formula}x=e that {a mathematical formula}A(e) (i.e., {a mathematical formula}instd(x,y,c,main)) but {a mathematical formula}¬B(e) ({a mathematical formula}nottest_fails(nlit(x,z,c))), then there is an overriding for this axiom with respect to e in context c ({a mathematical formula}ovr(subClass,x,y,z,c)).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In turn, the positive literals in {a mathematical formula}Sc, 〈 Α ,e 〉 must be derived via the materialization calculus, and the negative literals via contradiction proofs defined by the test mechanism mentioned at the beginning of Section 5.2 and previously detailed.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the translation of local programs, we also add the defeasibility deduction rules of {a mathematical formula}PD, defining the rules for overriding and defeasible propagation of the global knowledge: in particular, the following rule ovr-subc provides the condition for overriding of atomic inclusion axioms like the one considered in our example:{a mathematical formula} Propagation of defeasible atomic inclusion axioms is defined by the rule prop-subc:{a mathematical formula} In Step 3 of the translation, the final program {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD) results as the union of {a mathematical formula}PG(G) and all the local programs, including {a mathematical formula}PC(cultural_tourist,KtourD).Let us now consider what can be inferred from {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">From the contents of {a mathematical formula}G and the context {a mathematical formula}cultural_tourist, it is easy to verify that by the rules{a mathematical formula} This holds because the test (instantiated by the overriding rule on {a mathematical formula}fbmatch) for negative literal {a mathematical formula}nlit(fbmatch,Interesting,cultural_tourist) succeeds: {a mathematical formula}¬Interesting(fbmatch) holds locally and {a mathematical formula}Interesting(fbmatch) is added in the test environment, thus a contradiction is found.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Hence the inheritance rule prop-subc is not applicable and {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD) ⊭ instd(fbmatch,Interesting,cultural_tourist,main).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">On the other hand, since {a mathematical formula}PK(KtourD) ⊭ ovr(subClass,market,Cheap,Interesting,cultural_tourist), rule prop-subc can be applied and{a mathematical formula} These results coincide with the semantic interpretation of overridings given in Example 12.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We show the claim for the contextualized FO-translation {a mathematical formula} Φ K,xc in (5); the result for the ordinary translation {a mathematical formula} Φ K is then obvious.To prove the result, we need to show that each axiom Α in K can be written as a universal Horn sentence {a mathematical formula} ∀ x. Φ Α (x,xc), where {a mathematical formula}x=x1, … ,xn is a list of free variables in {a mathematical formula} Φ Α (x,xc) depending on the type of the axiom Α as follows:</a>
