<a href="#0" id="0">{sup:6} Notice that, the exponential size of the game tree does not constitute a proof that finding the equilibrium strategies of an SRG-v requires exponential time in the parameters of the game because it does not exclude the existence of some compact representation of {a mathematical formula}D's strategies, e.g., Markovian strategies.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The decision problem MAX – COV-SET is defined as:INSTANCE: an instance of SRG-v with a target set T and a covering set {a mathematical formula}T ′ ⊂ T;QUESTION: is {a mathematical formula}T ′ maximal?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The optimization version of k – SRG-v, say OPT – SRG-v, is{a mathematical formula}APX-hard even in the restricted case in which the graph is metric, there is only one signal s, all targets{a mathematical formula}t ∈ T(s)have the same penetration time{a mathematical formula}d(t), and there exists a maximal covering route covering all the targets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If otherwise, the condition is verified, then the algorithm (assuming validity of Conditions 1 and 2) might obtain a covering set {a mathematical formula}Q¯v,wk+1 which is not a proper one, meaning that by walking its generative route at least one target {a mathematical formula}t ′ ∉ Q¯v,wk+1 gets covered.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider a problem instance with a single signal, arbitrary target values while topology and penetration times are as follow:{a mathematical formula}We report the expansions made by the algorithm for increasing cardinalities (value of k) in the following table.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We notice that even in the case we introduce a logarithmic upper bound over the size of the covering sets generated by Algorithm 1, we could obtain a number of routes that is {a mathematical formula}O(2log2 ⁡ (|T(s)|)), and therefore exponential.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It follows that a sufficient condition for the placement in {a mathematical formula}v ⁎ being optimal is given by the following inequality:{a mathematical formula}To prove Proposition 1, it then suffices to provide a Patrolling Game instance where Equation (1) holds under some non-null missed detection rate Α .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We evaluate the scalability of Algorithm 1 and the quality of the solution returned by our approximation algorithms for a set of instances of SRG-v. We do not include results on the evaluation of the algorithm to solve completely a PG, given that it trivially requires asymptotically {a mathematical formula}|V| times the effort required by the resolution of a single instance of SRG-v.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">5 the compute time (averaged over 100 SRG-v instances) required by our exact dynamic programming algorithm (Algorithm 1), with the annotation of dominated covering sets and the generation of the routes, as {a mathematical formula}|T| and Ε vary.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We shall call {a mathematical formula}G the complete game including all {a mathematical formula}D's dominated actions and {a mathematical formula}GR the reduced game; CCS will denote the full version of Algorithm 1 and LP will denote the linear program to solve SRG-v. Each instance is solved for a random starting vertex v; we report average ratios for 100 instances.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The best case in terms of maximization of the value of OPT – SRG-v is, due to reasons of symmetry (all the targets have the same value), when there is a set of {a mathematical formula}|T(s)| covering routes of length {a mathematical formula} Β |T(s)| − 1 such that each target is visited exactly by {a mathematical formula} Β |T(s)| − 1 routes.</a>
