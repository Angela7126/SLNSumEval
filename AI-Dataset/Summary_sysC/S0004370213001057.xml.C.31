<a href="#4" id="4">These variables are subject to temporal and resource constraints.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In order to model a temporal dependency {a mathematical formula} 〈 i,j, Θ (i,j), Δ (i,j) 〉 we have implemented a modular precedence constraint (ModPC), with the following signature:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}ei,sj, Η i, Β j, Λ are the variables representing the end time of activity i, the start time of activity j, their respective iteration numbers and the period.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The parameters {a mathematical formula} Θ (i,j) and {a mathematical formula} Δ (i,j) are assumed to have fixed values.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The filtering algorithm for the constraint is described in Section 6.1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula} Ω [idx].activity: the activity corresponding to item {a mathematical formula} Ω [idx].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula} Ω [idx].time: the time value, either the {a mathematical formula}LSTi or the {a mathematical formula}EETi.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The algorithm makes again use of a circular queue Ω .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">However, the value {a mathematical formula} Ω [idx].time of the items corresponding to the Earliest End Time is computed assuming that {a mathematical formula} Λ = Λ ̲ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In other words, they are the Earliest End Time for the scenario where the period takes its minimum value, corresponding to the most constrained resource profile.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The structure of the search strategy is the same as before: an activity j is selected, then a value is assigned to its start time and iteration variables (i.e.</a>
