<a href="#0" id="0">Example 1</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Assume we only have the random variable Predisposition of the example in Section 2.2 and view the atom dm as binary random variable (DM).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The definition does not exactly define a probability distribution as it contains imprecise knowledge, but we can define a probability distribution consistent with the definition for those two random variables by the following assignments:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} From this one can compute the probability of for instance {a mathematical formula}P(DM=true):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula} Ω V is the sample space of the random variables V defined as the Cartesian product of the random variables' ranges:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Example 4</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider the running example of Section 2.3:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Suppose that {a mathematical formula}Time_Comp1 and {a mathematical formula}Time_Comp2 are the only two random variables in the enumeration.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The range of both variables are the real numbers: {a mathematical formula}Range1=Range2=R.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The used constraint language includes at least linear inequalities and the probability measure is such that the first two variables are independent and distributed according to an exponential distribution.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Definition 8</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Probability boundsWe define the lower and upper probability bounds of a query q as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">An overview of the PCLP syntax is given in Table 2.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Rules are built according to the LP syntax with additional 〈 〉 -constructs within which constraints are defined using the syntax of the used constraint languages, as discussed previously.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">New here is the definition of credal set specifications for a countable number of variables in the sense of Section 5.2.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">We define credal sets by a number of random variable definitions.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Random variable definitions define credal sets for groups of finitely many random variables, such that the definition of each random variable depends only on a finite number of other ones.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Definitions have the form:{a mathematical formula} where each {a mathematical formula}Vi is a random variable label, {a mathematical formula}Xi is a parameter, {a mathematical formula}pi is a probability and {a mathematical formula} Φ i is a constraint.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Proposition 4</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The lower and upper probability bounds of a query q, concerning only the first n random variables, in a PCLP program, fulfilling the exact inference conditions, can be computed as:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}HereCis the credal set specification defined by the program (Lemma 4).</a>
