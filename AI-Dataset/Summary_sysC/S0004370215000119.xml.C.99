<a href="#0" id="0">The weak Ε -core is defined for a particular coalition structure that may or may not be not optimal, relaxes only the non-blocking condition with parameter Ε , and efficiently distributes the rewards that the coalition structure earns.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the other hand, the weak Ε -core{sup:+} does not specify a particular coalition structure beforehand.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It then relaxes the efficiency condition of the weak Ε -core (for the optimal coalition structure), in addition to the non-blocking condition, and efficiently distributes the reward that the dual solution provides.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The weak Ε -core for the optimal coalition structure {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ requires that the payoff vector be efficient.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To find an efficient payoff vector, we need to know the exact value of {a mathematical formula}V(CS ⁎ ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since finding its exact value is NP-hard, it is natural to utilize an approximate, semi-optimal solution against the weak Ε -core for {a mathematical formula}CS ⁎ .</a>
