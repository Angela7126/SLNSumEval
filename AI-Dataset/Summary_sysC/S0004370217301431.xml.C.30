<a href="#0" id="0">We can now define a STPUD planning problem P as a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 V,I,T,A,G 〉 where:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Intuitively, an element {a mathematical formula} 〈 t,a,d 〉 indicates the start of an instance of the action a at time t, with duration d if a is a controllable action.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The assignment of {a mathematical formula}d= ⊥ for uncontrollable actions reflects the intuitive notion that since the duration is not under the control of the plan executor, the plan cannot specify it.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">2 graphically shows a valid strong plan {a mathematical formula} Π ex for the running example.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The plan is defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula} Note that all the actions in {a mathematical formula} Π ex have uncontrollable duration; hence, the strong plan does not specify their duration (durations are replaced by ⊥ ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Set of changes {an inline-figure}Given a projected planning problem instance {a mathematical formula}ctrl(P)= ˙ 〈 V,I,T,A,G 〉 and a plan {a mathematical formula} Π = ˙ { 〈 ti,ai,di 〉 |i ∈ [1,n]}, the multi-set of changes induced by Π is a set {an inline-figure} defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Induced chronicleGiven a projected planning problem instance {a mathematical formula}ctrl(P)= ˙ 〈 V,I,T,A,G 〉 and a plan Π , a chronicle {a mathematical formula} Τ Π induced by Π is defined as follows.For each variable f,</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Projected problem plan validityGiven a projected problem {a mathematical formula}ctrl(P)= ˙ 〈 V,I,T,A,G 〉 , a plan Π is valid if the following conditions hold:</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Given a step {a mathematical formula}si of Χ (that is an instance of a classical planning action), we write {a mathematical formula}effects(si) to indicate the set of its effects, each of the form {a mathematical formula} 〈 f:=v 〉 .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Moreover, we write {a mathematical formula}conditions(si) to indicate the set of preconditions of {a mathematical formula}si, each in the form {a mathematical formula} ⋁ i=1nfi=vi.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Building a strong plan Σ from a strong schedule for the TNU is analogous to the plain temporal planning case: each pair of corresponding {a mathematical formula} 〈 siast,sjaet 〉 ∈ Χ is a step of Σ , the time for the step is {a mathematical formula} Μ (siast) and, if a is controllable, the duration is {a mathematical formula} Μ (sjaet) − Μ (sjast).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this section, we present our compilation technique, which can be used to reduce any planning instance P having duration uncertainty into a temporal planning instance {a mathematical formula}P ′ in which all actions have controllable durations.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The translation guarantees that P is solvable if and only if {a mathematical formula}P ′ is solvable, and it fully supports the Unc-Arbit problem class.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Moreover, given any plan for {a mathematical formula}P ′ we can derive a plan for P. This approach comes at the cost of duplicating some of the variables in the domain, but allows for the use of off-the-shelf temporal planners.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In general, our translation rewrites a STPUD problem {a mathematical formula}P= ˙ 〈 V,I,T,G,A 〉 into a new planning instance {a mathematical formula}P ′ = ˙ 〈 V ′ ,I ′ ,T ′ ,G ′ ,A ′ 〉 that does not contain actions with uncontrollable duration.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">For each end-relative condition {a mathematical formula} 〈 (eta ′ − Δ 1,eta ′ − Δ 2)] Φ 〉 :</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The {a mathematical formula}transmit action has only one effect: {a mathematical formula} 〈 [ettrans]sent:=T 〉 and no other action nor TIL can change the {a mathematical formula}sent variable.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Moreover, no action has a condition that depends on {a mathematical formula}sent, hence general condition (1) is satisfied.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Finally, general conditions (2) and (3) are trivially satisfied because the {a mathematical formula}transmit action has no ending conditions.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Therefore, all the conditions are satisfied and the example problem can be simplified as follows.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">{a mathematical formula} The resulting simplified problem now has one uncontrollable action and one controllable action, without any additional variables or conditions.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Moreover, each plan for the resulting problem corresponds to a strong plan for the original problem (with the obvious removal of durations for the simplified actions in the plan).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Let us now consider the {a mathematical formula}move action.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">In this case, condition (2) is violated, because the TIL {a mathematical formula} 〈 [15]hot:=F 〉 affects the variable hot that appears in the condition {a mathematical formula} 〈 [etmove]hot=F 〉 .</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">In fact, a plan starting the move action at time 1 would be valid in the simplified problem, but it does not yield a strong plan because the uncontrollable action {a mathematical formula}move could end at time 11 and the ending condition {a mathematical formula} 〈 [etmove]hot=F 〉 would be unsatisfied.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">For this reason, the {a mathematical formula}move action cannot be simplified to its maximal duration.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Given a strong plan Σ , let{a mathematical formula} Χ = ⋃ s ∈ Σ snap(action(s)).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Analogously, we call {a mathematical formula} Σ Π the projection plan for R of a strong plan Π for P obtained by fixing the duration of each uncontrollable action in Π to its maximum.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Let Π be a strong plan for P. {a mathematical formula} Σ Π is a valid temporal plan for R because:</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Σ be a plan for R. Then {a mathematical formula} Π Σ is a valid strong temporal plan for P because:</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Each action a is executable in P regardless of the action duration, because the variables are aligned because of Lemma 2, {a mathematical formula}a ′ ∈ Σ is executable in R and the conditions in the translated actions are a super-set of the ones in the original action, because of the Χ function.</a>
