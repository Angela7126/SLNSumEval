<a href="#0" id="0">Although the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent models his opponent as being able use zero-order theory of mind, agents in our setup do not know the extent of the abilities of their opponents with certainty.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Through repeated interaction, a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent may come to believe that his opponent is not a {a mathematical formula}ToM0 agent, and that she has no beliefs at all.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Just as a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent models his opponent as having a zero-order theory of mind, a second-order theory of mind ({a mathematical formula}ToM2) agent models a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 opponent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The action spaces of the agent and his opponent are the same, {a mathematical formula}Ai=Aj={R,P,S}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent also has zero-order beliefs {a mathematical formula}b(0) about what his opponent will do.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">That is, the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent determines his prediction of opponent behaviour similar to the way a {a mathematical formula}ToM0 agent determines his own behaviour.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(2) A {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent ʼ s first-order theory of mind provides the agent with a prediction {a mathematical formula}a ˆ j(1) of opponent behaviour.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The table shows that the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent has zero-order beliefs {a mathematical formula}b(0), which indicate the agent ʼ s beliefs concerning his opponent ʼ s actions, as well as first-order beliefs {a mathematical formula}b(1).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The agent ʼ s first-order theory of mind predicts that his opponent will select the action that will yield her the highest payoff.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula} Using his first-order theory of mind, the agent predicts that his opponent is going to play P.Note that the agent ʼ s prediction {a mathematical formula}a ˆ j(1) conflicts with his zero-order beliefs {a mathematical formula}b(0).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this case, the agent ʼ s confidence {a mathematical formula}c1 in first-order theory of mind is 0.9.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To determine his opponent ʼ s actions, the {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent needs to know her confidence {a mathematical formula}c1 in first-order theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As for the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent, a {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent does not know at which order of theory of mind his opponent is playing.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The agent ʼ s model of his opponent ʼ s first-order beliefs are captured by {a mathematical formula}b(2).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} The action that maximizes this value represents the agent ʼ s prediction of the action his opponent is going to play according to his second-order theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In this case:{a mathematical formula} Based on his integrated beliefs of what the opponent is going to do, the {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent ʼ s choice is to play S.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">These beliefs are used to expand his decision process by modeling the decision process of a {a mathematical formula}(k − 1)st-order theory of mind agent from his opponent ʼ s point of view.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">He does so by modeling the decision process of a {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent from his opponent ʼ s point of view.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Second-order beliefs {a mathematical formula}b(2) specify what the agent believes his opponent to believe about what he believes that she is going to do.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Specifically, the agent ʼ s second-order beliefs {a mathematical formula}b(2) determine what the agent believes his opponent to believe what he believes about her actions.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">When a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent makes use of his theory of mind, he assumes that his opponent reacts to new information the same way he does.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Performance of the {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent playing RPS against a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 opponent is nonetheless slightly lower than that of a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent playing RPS against a {a mathematical formula}ToM0 opponent.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Although the {a mathematical formula}ToM3 agent can still outperform a {a mathematical formula}ToM2 opponent at a small margin, Fig.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">7b shows that a {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent outperforms a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 opponent as well.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">However, performance of a {a mathematical formula}ToM3 agent playing ERPS against a {a mathematical formula}ToM2 opponent is still poor in comparison to performance of the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 and {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agents playing ERPS against opponents of a lower order of theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">In this case, the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent ʼ s model of his opponent ʼ s beliefs matches her actual beliefs.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Performance of the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent is particularly low when his opponent has the maximum learning speed {a mathematical formula} Λ j=1.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">In this case, the {a mathematical formula}ToM0 opponent believes that there is a small probability that the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent will play some action other than ‘ paper ’ .</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent also has particular difficulties modeling a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 opponent in RPSLS when his own learning speed {a mathematical formula} Λ i is low.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">In this case, the {a mathematical formula}ToM2 agent is outperformed by an opponent of lower order of theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">9 shows the performance of theory of mind agents as a function of the learning speed {a mathematical formula} Λ i of the focal agent and the learning speed {a mathematical formula} Λ j of his opponent.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">In this case, the {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent ʼ s implicit assumption that his opponent has the same learning speed as himself is correct.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">As for the cases of RPS and ERPS described above, applying theory of mind appears to be least effective when a {a mathematical formula}ToM1 agent is playing against a {a mathematical formula}ToM0 opponent that has a low learning speed.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">However, the advantage of a {a mathematical formula}ToM3 agent over a {a mathematical formula}ToM2 opponent is only marginal.</a>
