<a href="#0" id="0">We will see later that our algorithm satisfies the constraint given by (2) for each task t with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ), where Μ is the confidence parameter with which constraint is satisfied.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then the regret of an algorithm {a mathematical formula}A if the constraint is satisfied is given as:{a mathematical formula} Since the constraint is satisfied with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ):{a mathematical formula} where L is the cost that is incurred by the requester if the constraint fails to satisfy.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, {a mathematical formula} ∀ i ∈ Nq ˆ i − ≤ qi ≤ q ˆ i+ with probability greater then {a mathematical formula}1 − Μ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, {a mathematical formula}q ˆ + − q ≤ h − 1( Δ ) with probability {a mathematical formula}1 − Μ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By safely, we mean that with qualities known perfectly, GA algorithm has a candidate solution of cost less than or equal to any candidate solution containing r with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Μ ) and there is no need to consider expert r for the future tasks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We extend the algorithm to the AAB setting by exploring all the experts with probability {a mathematical formula} Ε t and selecting minimum cost expert subset meeting the constraint with empirically estimated qualities with probability {a mathematical formula}(1 − Ε t).</a>
