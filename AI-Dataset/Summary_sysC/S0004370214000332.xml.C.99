<a href="#0" id="0">Each position i of the backbone is associated with a subset {a mathematical formula}Di of all (amino-acid, rotamer) pairs in the library.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The problem is to identify at each position i a pair from {a mathematical formula}Di such that the overall energy E is minimized.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is easy to see that this condition is always weaker than the previous one, and therefore applicable to more cases.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These two properties define polynomial time algorithms that prune dominated values.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since its introduction in 1992 by Desmet, DEE has become the fundamental tool of exact CPD, and various extensions have been proposed [73], [63], [32].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">When the DEE algorithm does not significantly reduce the search space, the {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search tree can be too slow or memory demanding and the problem cannot be solved.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, to circumvent these limitations and increase the ability of CPD to tackle problems with larger sequence-conformation spaces, novel alternative methods are needed.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Interestingly, in CPD, the admissible heuristic used in the DEE/{a mathematical formula}A ⁎ algorithm at depth d of the search tree is [33]:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">From a WCSP perspective, interpreting energies as cost functions, this heuristic is exactly the PFC-DAC lower bound [85], [56] used in WCSP.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">These values correspond to forbidden assignments because the sum of the corresponding binary term plus the two unary costs plus the current lower bound {a mathematical formula}E ∅ (produced by soft arc consistency) is greater than or equal to the current upper bound k. Such values s do not need to be considered by the min operation because {a mathematical formula}{ir,js} does not belong to any optimal solution, whereas {a mathematical formula}{iu,js} may.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Worst-cost differences are computed by the function {a mathematical formula}getDifference(j,i,u,r) applied to every binary cost function related to i, discarding forbidden assignments with {a mathematical formula}{ir,js} (line 8), as suggested by Eq.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In order to reduce the time (and space) complexity of pruning by dominance, we test only one pair of values per variable.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Hence the name, {a mathematical formula}DEE1, for the new algorithm described in Algorithm 2.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">To capture the fact that there is at most one value selected per domain, we penalize the simultaneous selection of every pair {a mathematical formula}ir,is of rotamers of the same variable i with a sufficiently large penalty M. To guarantee that at least one value will be selected in each domain, we shift all finite energies by a constant negative term N such that all shifted finite energies are strictly negative.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">On the simple 2TRX problem ({a mathematical formula}n=11, first line of Table 1), QP/cplex solver explored 51,003,970 nodes and was interrupted by the time-out with an optimality gap of 774%.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This indicates a poor lower bound that leads to memory intensive best first search.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">But the more important problem with this encoding is that with a quadratic number of extra variables, both minimaxsat and akmaxsat were extremely slow, exploring at most 2 nodes before the 9000-second time-out and in several instances timed out before even finishing the lower bound computation at the root node.</a>
