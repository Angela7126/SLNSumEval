<a href="#0" id="0">The analysis given essentially derives from the individual benefit-maximizing strategies of the auctioneer (given the bidders' belief regarding whether or not the auctioneer is planning to purchase the information and which values she will disclose) and the bidders (given the auctioneer's decision of whether to purchase the information and which values she is planning to disclose).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This leads to the characterization of stable solutions and a perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As part of the analysis we characterize the influence of the cost of obtaining the information over the equilibrium and the resulting expected benefit of the different players, proving, among other things, that an equilibrium always exists.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The auctioneer does not disclose any value – the dominating strategy for each bidder is to bid her expected private value, given that {a mathematical formula}x ∉ Rbidder[17].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore the bid {a mathematical formula}B(t, ∅ ) of a bidder of type t in this case is:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁎ (X=x) is the posterior probability, given that {a mathematical formula}x ∉ Rbidder.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Namely, the probability of having x be the true common value will now be calculated as:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Therefore, bidders' dominating (or “ best response ” ) strategies can be compactly represented by the set {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, such that for any disclosed value x they bid {a mathematical formula}B(t,x)=Vt(x), and when no value is disclosed they bid {a mathematical formula}B(t, ∅ ) according to (2) where {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁎ (X=x) is calculated according to (3).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From this point on we thus use {a mathematical formula}Rbidder both as a belief and a strategy interchangeably.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">An equilibrium profile of strategies in this case can be represented by the pair {a mathematical formula}(Rauc,{B(t,x)|x ∈ X ⁎ orx= ∅ }), from which neither the auctioneer nor the bidders have an incentive to deviate individually.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This pair maps to whether or not the auctioneer purchases the information (purchases if {a mathematical formula}Rauc ≠ ∅ ), what values she discloses (any value {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Rauc), what values she does not disclose (any value {a mathematical formula}x ∉ Rauc) and the bidders' bids, depending on the value they receive.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since bidding according to (1) and (2), given {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, dominates any other bidding strategy, we can use a compact representation of strategy profiles (or “ solutions ” ) in the form {a mathematical formula}(Rauc,Rbidder), where bidders' bids are calculated according to (1) and (2), based on {a mathematical formula}Rbidder.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If indeed the solution is of the form {a mathematical formula}(Rauc,Rbidder), where {a mathematical formula}Rauc ≠ Rbidder, then the bidders can benefit from deviating to (i.e., calculating {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁎ (X=x) according to) {a mathematical formula}Rbidder ′ =Rauc, since this will result in a bid that equals the bidder's expected valuation of the item in cases where no information is disclosed (whereas when {a mathematical formula}Rbidder is used the bid is either greater or lesser than the bidder's expected valuation of the item).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{sup:4} In other words, since the bidders' best response is to bid according to {a mathematical formula}Rauc then a solution {a mathematical formula}(Rauc,Rbidder) of the form {a mathematical formula}Rauc ≠ Rbidder is never stable.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The analysis of the case where bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option to purchase the information is an instance of the case where the auctioneer needs to calculate her expected-benefit-maximizing strategy given the bidders' belief {a mathematical formula}Rbidder, as given in Section 3.2, for {a mathematical formula}Rbidder= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In this case, the auctioneer will simply choose the subset {a mathematical formula}Rauc associated with the maximum value according to the first column in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Since all elements in the first column, except for {a mathematical formula}( ∅ , ∅ ), decrease equally due to the increase in the value C, the auctioneer will keep on using this strategy for any setting with greater C values until her expected benefit is less than {a mathematical formula}u( ∅ , ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">As for the dependency of the auctioneer's expected benefit in C for the case in which the bidders are unaware of the auctioneer's option of purchasing the information, here the only possible switch is from {a mathematical formula}Rauc ≠ ∅ to {a mathematical formula}Rauc= ∅ (though this derives only from the auctioneer's optimization considerations rather than stability considerations).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">This is because once the auctioneer determines the strategy {a mathematical formula}Rauc that yields her the maximum expected benefit, the expected benefit from this strategy and from any other strategy {a mathematical formula}R ≠ ∅ decreases equally due to an increase in the value of C. Therefore, the only way that the choice of a preferred subset-to-be-disclosed can change is when {a mathematical formula}Rauc= ∅ becomes associated with the highest value in its column in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Furthermore, the expected benefit of the auctioneer at the cost of transition does not change (since otherwise the auctioneer would have kept the {a mathematical formula}Rauc ≠ ∅ strategy), and remains constant as C further increases (as the expected benefit with {a mathematical formula}Rauc= ∅ does not depend on C).</a>
