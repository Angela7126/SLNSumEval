<a href="#0" id="0">The value of this leaf is the value of the GFODD B under the interpretation, I, with variable valuation Ζ and is denoted {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I, Ζ ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">1 on interpretation {a mathematical formula}I=([1,2,3],{E(1,3),E(3,1),E(1,2),E(2,1)}).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular we have that {a mathematical formula} Σ 1P=NP, and {a mathematical formula} Π 1P=co-NP.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We claim that f is satisfied if and only if there is some interpretation I such that {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I)=1.Consider first the case where f is satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The only violation of ordering is the use of {a mathematical formula}PT() in the first block.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Using this fact, we can show that non-equivalence is in {a mathematical formula} Σ 2P.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We make k calls to FODD Evaluation with {a mathematical formula}(B,I,vi) as input.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This problem was shown to be {a mathematical formula} Π 2P-complete by [31].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We claim that {a mathematical formula}MAPB1(I)=1 and {a mathematical formula}MAPB2(I)=0.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We next consider the node ordering in {a mathematical formula}B1 and {a mathematical formula}B2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For {a mathematical formula}B2 we consider the sub-block structure of the construction.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">16 we observe that {a mathematical formula}B2 has the structure shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">It is easy to see that {a mathematical formula}B2 is satisfied in I if and only if the reordered diagram is satisfied in I.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As argued above in this case {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I)=1 as needed.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">For the other direction let I be such that {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I)=1.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Consider the input {a mathematical formula}(B,I,V).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">In the max case, if the true value is at least V then we say Yes for some Ζ , and if the true value is less than V then {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I, Ζ )<v for all Ζ and therefore we always say No.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">This yields the diagram B where we set the aggregation function to be {a mathematical formula}Q1Aw1,Q2Aw2, … ,QmAwm.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Otherwise {a mathematical formula} Ζ (v) maps the block to b.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Let Ζ be such a valuation and let {a mathematical formula}QjA be the first block from the left whose constraint is violated.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Let B be a GFODD with aggregation {a mathematical formula}max ⁡ w1,min ⁡ w2, … ,QkAwk.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The diagram {a mathematical formula}B1 has two portions.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The first verifies that I has at least two objects and the truth values of {a mathematical formula}PT() on these objects are different.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The two portions are put together so as to respect predicate order, and the final diagram {a mathematical formula}B1 is shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Finally consider any I with two objects where {a mathematical formula}PT() has the same truth value on the two objects.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">{a mathematical formula}(B1,B) for GFODD equivalence.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The combined diagram {a mathematical formula}B1 for our example is shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Therefore the aggregation is 1.The diagram {a mathematical formula}B2 is constructed by modifying {a mathematical formula}B2 from the proof of Theorem 20.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">In the current proof {a mathematical formula}xi is a set of variables from the QBF and therefore {a mathematical formula}wi is a set of blocks of variables, all of which have the same aggregation function.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">{a mathematical formula}B2 includes the variable consistency blocks followed by the clause blocks.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Let Ζ be such a valuation and let {a mathematical formula}QjA be the first block from the left whose constraint is violated.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">If we identify {a mathematical formula} ℓ +4 distinct objects we set the value to 0.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">This is shown for the predicate {a mathematical formula}T() in Fig.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">28 where the variables {a mathematical formula}m1,m2 are min variables.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">29 and the truth value gadget for the simulation of {a mathematical formula}Pxi is shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">If the interpretation has {a mathematical formula} ≥ ℓ +4 objects then the top portion of the diagram yields 0 for some valuation of z's.</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">We have {a mathematical formula}MAPB1(I, Ζ )=0.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">Considering any variants of {a mathematical formula} Ζ p which are not block consistent on {a mathematical formula}w1,w2 but otherwise identical we see that their value is also 0.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">As {a mathematical formula} Ζ p is arbitrary, it follows that the final value is 0.</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Therefore, if I is illegal then {a mathematical formula}MAPB1(I)=0.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Consider next any legal interpretation and the intended valuation {a mathematical formula} Ζ p to {a mathematical formula}T,y1,y2,x1, … ,x ℓ .</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">For any group 1 extension of this valuation and any valuation of the variables {a mathematical formula}m,z,r the diagram yields 1.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">34 and it has the same aggregation function as {a mathematical formula}B1.</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">Therefore, by C1, if {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I, Ζ )=1 then I is legal.</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">Next, consider any legal I and any unintended valuation {a mathematical formula} Ζ p for the prefix {a mathematical formula}T,y1,y2,x1, … ,x ℓ .</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">On the other hand, if we allow constants in the signature the problem follows the same scheme as above and is {a mathematical formula} Σ 2P-complete.</a>
