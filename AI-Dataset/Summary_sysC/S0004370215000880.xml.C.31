<a href="#4" id="4">SD proportionality implies weak SD proportionality.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Assume an assignment p does not satisfy weak SD proportionality.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, there exists some agent {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N such that {a mathematical formula}(1/n, … ,1/n) ≻ iSDp(i).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">But this implies that {a mathematical formula}¬[p(i) ≿ iSD(1/n, … ,1/n)].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence p is not SD proportional.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Weak SD proportionality and possible envy-freeness are equivalent.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">By Theorem 3(iii), possible envy-freeness implies weak SD proportionality.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If an assignment satisfies weak SD proportionality, then there exist cardinal utilities consistent with the ordinal preferences for which proportionality is satisfied.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Hence for {a mathematical formula}n=2, there exist cardinal utilities consistent with the ordinal preferences for which envy-freeness is satisfied, which means that the assignment satisfies possible envy-freeness.</a>

<a href="#14" id="14">It can be checked in polynomial time whether a discrete SD proportional assignment exists even if agents are allowed to express indifference between objects.</a>
