<a href="#0" id="0">A data integration setting {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D)complies to a Boolean policy p if there exists a source instance {a mathematical formula}D ′ indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}D for {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M such that {a mathematical formula}D ⊨ p implies {a mathematical formula}D ′ ⊭ p.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, consider the following source instance {a mathematical formula}D3ex.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A data integration setting {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D)strongly complies to a Boolean policy p if there exists a source instance {a mathematical formula}D ′ indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}D for {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M such that {a mathematical formula}D ⊨ p if and only if {a mathematical formula}D ′ ⊭ p.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{an inline-figure} is true if and only if {an inline-figure} is true for all source instances {a mathematical formula}D; and</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{an inline-figure} is true if and only if {an inline-figure} is true for all source instances {a mathematical formula}D.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">CQ entailment in the absence of an ontology is in {an inline-figure}, while the following theorem proves that even with no ontology {an inline-figure} can be {a mathematical formula} Π 2p-hard.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">First, for a source instance {a mathematical formula}D ′ to be indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}D, the virtual image of {a mathematical formula}D ′ via the mappings can only contain constants from {a mathematical formula}ADom(D).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We will first show how to construct a set of GAV mappings {a mathematical formula}M, a Boolean UCQ p and a source instance {a mathematical formula}D such that {an inline-figure} if and only if the instance has a solution.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We need to show that {an inline-figure} does not hold — that is, there exists a tuple of constants a of the same size as s such that for each source instance {a mathematical formula}D ′ indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}D there is a homomorphism from {a mathematical formula}p(a) to {a mathematical formula}D ′ .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">By construction, h is a homomorphism from {a mathematical formula}p(a) to {a mathematical formula}D ′ .Suppose now that {an inline-figure} does not hold — that is, there exists a tuple a of constants of the same size as s such that for each source instance {a mathematical formula}D ′ indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}D there is a homomorphism from {a mathematical formula}p(a) to {a mathematical formula}D ′ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It is harmless for {an inline-figure}, because we just look for an indistinguishable source instance in which {a mathematical formula}p(a) holds, regardless of the fact whether it holds in {a mathematical formula}D or not.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">if Φ is true and a source instance {a mathematical formula}D ′ without {a mathematical formula}Trigger(d) is indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}D, then {a mathematical formula}D ′ ⊨ Ξ ,</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">As a result, every {a mathematical formula}D ′ indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}D must include the policy and hence {an inline-figure}, as required.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In what follows we do the same for data complexity, where the ontology {a mathematical formula}O, mappings {a mathematical formula}M and policy p are considered fixed and only the source instance {a mathematical formula}D forms the input.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let {a mathematical formula}D ′ be an indistinguishable source instance without the policy fact {a mathematical formula}SZero(s).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The first is not possible because policy {a mathematical formula}SZero(s) does not hold in {a mathematical formula}D ′ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">On the other, since {an inline-figure}, for all indistinguishable {a mathematical formula}D ′ it holds that {a mathematical formula}D ′ ⊨ p1.</a>
