<a href="#0" id="0">Many different modelling techniques now exist which vary widely in their underlying assumptions and methodology, largely due to the different needs and constraints of the sub-communities within which they were developed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Assumptions may pertain to aspects of the modelled agent, such as whether the agent makes deterministic or stochastic action choices, and whether its behaviour is fixed or may change over time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">They may also pertain to aspects of the environment, such as whether the actions of other agents and environment states are observed fully or only partially with possible uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Current methodologies include learning detailed models of an agent's decision making as well as reasoning about spaces of such models; inferring an agent's goals and plans based on hierarchical action descriptions; recursive reasoning to predict an agent's state of mind and its higher-order beliefs about other agents; and many other approaches.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Most methods surveyed in the earlier sections use models that make predictions about a single agent, following the agent model shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For methods that predict an agent's actions, such as policy reconstruction (Section 4.1), type-based reasoning (Section 4.2), and recursive reasoning (Section 4.5), modelling single agents is predicated on the assumption that agents choose actions independently from each other, as defined in Section 3.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, many papers proceed by explaining their methods for a single agent, with the underlying idea that the same method can be used to maintain separate models for each other agent.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Note that this separation does not mean that agents ignore each other, since the models may base their predictions on the observed actions of other agents.</a>
