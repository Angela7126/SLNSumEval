<a href="#0" id="0">Every action that a BayesAct agent can take (a) has an affective aspect or “ meaning ” ({a mathematical formula}ba in Fig.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The observations {a mathematical formula} Ω x are anything the system observes in the environment that gives it evidence about the state X.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The actions of the agent are now expanded to be {a mathematical formula}B={A,Ba}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}T={Tij} be similarly defined and denote the set of transient agent sentiments.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">T may differ significantly from F, for example if the student “ swears at ” the tutor, he will seem considerably more “ bad ” than as given by shared fundamental sentiments about students (so {a mathematical formula} Τ ce<fce).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, {a mathematical formula}Ba gives the affective “ how ” for the delivery “ what ” of an action, A.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The affective action {a mathematical formula}Ba={Bae,Bap,Baa} will also be continuous valued and three dimensional: the agent sets an EPA value for its action (not a propositional action label).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This gives the probabilistic generalisation of the affect control principle (Definition 1):{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Ψ (f ′ , Τ ,x)=(f ′ − M(x)G(f ′ , Τ ,x))T Σ − 1(f ′ − M(x)G(f ′ , Τ ,x)) and Ξ represents the temporal “ inertial ” dynamics of {a mathematical formula}f ′ , encoding both the stability of affective identities and the dynamics of affective behaviours.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The belief state can be used to compute expected values of quantities of interest defined on the state space, such as the expected deflection{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}D(s) is the deflection of s. This gives us a way to connect more closely with emotional “ labels ” from appraisal theories.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">facial expressions) can be viewed as a method for communicating an agent's current appraisal of the situation in terms of affective identities that the agent perceives, and would be part of the action space {a mathematical formula}ba.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The perception of emotional displays would be simply integrated into BayesAct using observations of client identity, {a mathematical formula}Fc.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This expectation will give us the most likely value of {a mathematical formula} Θ f given only the system state x.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula} Σ f is a set of parameters governing the strength of our prior beliefs that the identities of client and agent will remain constant over time.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{sup:8} Thus, {a mathematical formula} Σ f is a {a mathematical formula}9×9 block matrix:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Β a2 and {a mathematical formula} Β c2 are the variances of agent and client identity fundamentals (i.e.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">how much we expect agent and client to change their identities over time), and {a mathematical formula} Β b2(x) is infinite for a client turn and is zero for an agent turn.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Denote the “ normal ” or expected affective action distribution as {a mathematical formula} Π † (s)= Π † (fb):{a mathematical formula} where{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} and {a mathematical formula} Σ f † is the same as {a mathematical formula} Σ f given by Equation (24) with {a mathematical formula} Β b2(x) set to infinity (instead of zero) so the behaviour sentiments are unconstrained.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The precise method of getting the first set of samples is application dependent, but will normally be to draw the samples from a Gaussian distribution over the identities of the agent and client (with standard deviations of {a mathematical formula} Β a0 and {a mathematical formula} Β c0, resp.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Here we explore the case where two agents know their own self identities (so {a mathematical formula} Β a0=0.001) but do not know the identity of the other agent (so {a mathematical formula} Β c0 is set to the standard deviation of all identities in the database).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Agents take turns acting, and actions are conveyed to the other agent with the addition of some zero-mean normally distributed “ environment ” noise, with standard deviation {a mathematical formula} Σ e.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We perform 10 simulations per trial with {a mathematical formula} Β c=0.001 for both agent and client.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">3(c) shows a simulation between a “ tutor ” ({a mathematical formula}Fa=[1.5,1.5, − 0.2]) and a “ student ” ({a mathematical formula}Fc=[1.5,0.3,0.8]) with {a mathematical formula} Σ e=1.0.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">3(c), but with {a mathematical formula} Σ e=5.0.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">We built a simple tutoring application in which the identities for agent and client are initially set to “ tutor ” ({a mathematical formula}Fa=[1.5,1.5, − 0.2]) and “ student ” ({a mathematical formula}Fc=[1.5,0.3,0.8]), respectively, with low dynamics standard deviations of {a mathematical formula} Β a= Β c=0.01 and {a mathematical formula} Σ r=0.0 (see Section 3.3).</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The mean deflection for BayesAct was {a mathematical formula}2.9±2.1 while for random it was {a mathematical formula}4.5±2.2.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">We have done preliminary simulations with this model by using an agent identity of “ assistant ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[1.5,0.51,0.45]), and an initial client identity of “ patient ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.90, − 0.69, − 1.05]).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Then, agent and client BayesAct models are initialised with {a mathematical formula}Fa set to this personal identity, {a mathematical formula}Fc (identity of the other) set to either the true identity (if known) or else to the mean of the identities in the database, {a mathematical formula}[0.4,0.4,0.5].</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Agents take turns acting, and actions are conveyed to the other agent with the addition of some zero-mean normally distributed “ environment ” noise, with standard deviation {a mathematical formula} Σ e.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">We perform 10 simulations per trial with {a mathematical formula} Β c=0.001 for both agent and client.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">If the client knows the agent identity, it uses no roughening noise ({a mathematical formula} Σ r=0.0), otherwise all agents use {a mathematical formula} Σ r=N − 1/3 where N is the number of samples.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">We investigated the COACH system in simulation using an agent with an affective identity of “ assistant ” , and a client with an affective identity of “ elder ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[1.67,0.01, − 1.03]).</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Table E.11 shows an example simulation between the agent and a client (PwD) who holds the affective identity of “ elder ” .</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Thus, the BayesAct agent must learn this identity (shown as {a mathematical formula}fc in Table E.11) during the interaction if it wants to minimize deflection.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">We see in this case that the client starts with {a mathematical formula}AW= “ yes ” (1) and does the first two steps, but then stops and is prompted by the agent to rinse his hands.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Table E.12 shows the same client ( “ elder ” ) but this time the agent always uses the same affective actions: if prompting, it “ commands ” the user ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[ − 0.09,1.29,1.59]) and when not prompting it “ minds ” the user ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.86,0.17, − 0.16]).</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">If the client has the identity of a “ convalescent ” ({a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.3,0.09, − 0.03]), then we see the same effect as with “ elder ” .</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">However, if the client has a much more powerful identity ( “ boss ” {a mathematical formula}EPA=[0.48,2.16,0.94], as they might believe if they used to be such an identity), then we see that all prompting methods work more slowly (the “ boss ” does not need prompting!!</a>
