<a href="#1" id="1">Source instances {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ are indistinguishable for an ontology {a mathematical formula}O and mappings {a mathematical formula}M if, for every CQ q over the global schema, the certain answers to q over {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D) and {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D ′ ) coincide.The associated decision problem for an ontology language {a mathematical formula}O and mapping language {a mathematical formula}M is defined as follows, where {a mathematical formula}O ranges over {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M over {a mathematical formula}M: {an inline-figure} is true if and only if {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ are indistinguishable for {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M. We consider not only the combined complexity of {an inline-figure}, but also its data complexity — that is, the complexity under assumption that {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M are fixed, while only {a mathematical formula}D and {a mathematical formula}D ′ form the input.</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">A data integration setting {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D)complies to a Boolean policy p if there exists a source instance {a mathematical formula}D ′ indistinguishable from {a mathematical formula}D for {a mathematical formula}O and {a mathematical formula}M such that {a mathematical formula}D ⊨ p implies {a mathematical formula}D ′ ⊭ p.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Furthermore, {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D)complies to a policy {a mathematical formula}p(x) with m free variables x if it complies to {a mathematical formula}p(a) for all m-tuples a of constants from {a mathematical formula}D.The associated decision problem for an ontology language {a mathematical formula}O, mapping language {a mathematical formula}M, and policy language {a mathematical formula}P is defined as follows, where {a mathematical formula}O ranges over {a mathematical formula}O, {a mathematical formula}M over {a mathematical formula}M, and p over {a mathematical formula}P: {an inline-figure} is true if and only if {a mathematical formula}(O,M,D) complies to p. Data complexity of the compliance problem assumes that all {a mathematical formula}O, {a mathematical formula}M and p are fixed, while only {a mathematical formula}D forms the input.</a>
