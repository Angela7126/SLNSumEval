<a href="#0" id="0">When considering logics that do not satisfy the AGM assumptions, one loses the nice structure of classical logics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a result, for given K, A it may be the case that there is no suitable belief set to serve as a result of the operation {a mathematical formula}K − A and satisfy the contraction postulates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Theorem 4.14</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let{a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 be compact and let K be a belief set and A be finitely representable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{a mathematical formula}K − Ais an AGM-relevance contraction operator iff there is a selection function Γ such that{a mathematical formula}K − A= ⋂ Γ (K ⊥ A).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Despite this fact, we can show several interesting results regarding the connection between the three notions (recovery, relevance, partial meet) in Boolean logics.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let us start by investigating the relation between relevance and recovery.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We say that relevance implies recovery (in the presence of the other AGM postulates) in a logic {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 iff, whenever a contraction operator − satisfies relevance (and the other AGM postulates), it also satisfies recovery.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The definition of recovery implying relevance is completely analogous.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We say that relevance and recovery are equivalent in a logic {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 iff relevance implies recovery and vice-versa.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Theorem 4.18</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Consider a Boolean logic{a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 such that for all{a mathematical formula}K,A ⊆ Lwhere A is finitely representable, it holds that{a mathematical formula}Cn(A)=Cn( ∅ )or{a mathematical formula}K ⊥ A ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Then, any partial-meet contraction operator is an AGM-compliant contraction operator.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Definition A.5</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A logic {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 satisfies the generalized upper-bound property iff for every {a mathematical formula}K ⊆ L, every {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ K and every finitely representable {a mathematical formula}A ⊆ L for which {a mathematical formula}A ⊈ Cn(X), there is an {a mathematical formula}X ′ such that {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ X ′ and {a mathematical formula}X ′ ∈ K ⊥ A.</a>

<a href="#16" id="16">Consider a Boolean logic {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,Cn 〉 such that for all {a mathematical formula}K,A ⊆ L where A is finitely representable, it holds that {a mathematical formula}Cn(A)=Cn( ∅ ) or {a mathematical formula}K ⊥ A ≠ ∅ .</a>
