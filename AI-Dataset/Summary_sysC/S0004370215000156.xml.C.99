<a href="#0" id="0">Notice that although the value of {a mathematical formula}xq has been decided before, it cannot be encoded into the game state, because that would incur a polynomial space to remember the values of all variables, while the desired reduction should be a polynomial time or logarithmic space reduction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, we exploit the ability of incomplete information by taking another two chains of diamond structures for variable {a mathematical formula}xq, exactly the same as the one in the core part from the state {a mathematical formula}xq+1 to the state c. We call them helper chains.Concretely, we introduce a set {a mathematical formula}{xkq0,xk1q0,xk0q0,xkq1,xk1q1,xk0q1|1 ≤ q ≤ n,q<k ≤ n} ∪ {cq0,cq1|1 ≤ q ≤ n} of states, where {a mathematical formula}xkq0,xk1q0,xk0q0,cq0 are for the chain of diamond structures in which variable {a mathematical formula}xq has been given value 0 and {a mathematical formula}xkq1,xk1q1,xk0q1,cq1 are for the chain of diamond structures in which variable {a mathematical formula}xq has been given value 1.</a>
