<a href="#0" id="0">The posterior belief (probability) {a mathematical formula}Pr( Θ − i ⁎ |Ht) quantifies the relative likelihood that players {a mathematical formula}j ≠ i are of types {a mathematical formula} Θ − i ⁎ =( Θ 1 ⁎ , … , Θ i − 1 ⁎ , Θ i+1 ⁎ , … , Θ n ⁎ ), given the history {a mathematical formula}Ht.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If we assume independence of types, we can define Pr as{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}Pj( Θ j ⁎ ) is the prior belief (probability) that player j is of type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ before any actions are observed, and {a mathematical formula}L(Ht| Θ j ⁎ ) is the (non-negative) likelihood of history {a mathematical formula}Ht assuming that player j is of type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this case, {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ corresponds to the type spaces used in Bayesian games and ϒ corresponds to the “ basic probability distribution ” [56].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">(However, note that in contrast to Bayesian games, we assume no knowledge of {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ and ϒ .)</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">{sup:3} Essentially, we can define the factored state space {a mathematical formula}S ˆ =S× Θ 1+× … × Θ n+, where the S-element is observed by all players and controlled by their joint actions while the {a mathematical formula} Θ i+-elements are privately observed by the players and controlled by the type distribution.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, the results in this section pertain to a situation in which the user knows that the true type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ must be a subset of the hypothesised type space {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It can be shown that, under a pure type distribution and if HBA does not a priori rule out any of the types in {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ , then it will learn to make correct future predictions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Theorem 1 states that HBA will eventually make correct future predictions when using a product posterior against a pure type distribution (assuming the prior beliefs are positive).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As noted earlier, an implicit assumption in (1) is that the type distribution ϒ can be represented as a product of n independent factors (one for each player), such that {a mathematical formula} ϒ ( Θ )= ∏ j ϒ j( Θ j).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">While all our results hold for both cases, there is an important distinction: If {a mathematical formula} Γ =1, then the expected payoffs (3) correspond to the actual probability that the following state can lead to (or is) a terminal state (we call this the success rate), whereas this is not necessarily the case if {a mathematical formula} Γ <1.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In order to interpret PCTL expressions over X and Y, we make the following modifications without loss of generality: Firstly, any terminal state {a mathematical formula}s¯ ∈ S¯ is an absorbing state, meaning that if a process is in {a mathematical formula}s¯, then the next state will be {a mathematical formula}s¯ with probability 1 and all players receive a zero payoff.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In this regard, we note that any combination of beliefs Pr and types {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ can be described as a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j ⁎ of the form{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This combination is equivalent to sampling a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j ⁎ using probabilities {a mathematical formula}Pr( Θ j ⁎ |Ht), and then using {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ to choose actions {a mathematical formula}aj ∈ Aj via {a mathematical formula} Π j(Ht,aj, Θ j ⁎ )[68].</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Analogously, we may combine the true types {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ⊂ Θ j of player j, using the type distribution ϒ , into a single type {a mathematical formula} Θ ˆ j+ such that{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Therefore, to simplify the notation in this section, we will generally assume a single hypothesised type {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ ∈ Θ j and a single true type {a mathematical formula} Θ j+ ∈ Θ j.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Note that this means that our method can be applied to the combination of beliefs and hypothesised types, as well as to individual types in {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Furthermore, we will write {a mathematical formula} Π j(Ht, Θ j) to denote the probability distribution over actions {a mathematical formula}Aj (rather than probabilities of individual actions).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">While formally unnecessary (in the sense that our analysis does not require it), we find it a useful design guideline to interpret a score as a kind of likelihood, such that higher scores suggest higher likelihood of {a mathematical formula} Θ j ⁎ being correct.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In our case, absolute continuity always holds by Assumption 1 and the fact that the prior probabilities {a mathematical formula}Pj are positive as well as the fact that the type distribution is pure, from which we can infer that the true types always have positive posterior probability.In this proof, we seek to extend the convergence result of Kalai and Lehrer [65] (henceforth KL) to multi-state SBGs with pure type distributions.</a>
