<a href="#0" id="0">A solution to a scheduling problem is called a schedule and is usually given in the form of an assignment Σ of starting times {a mathematical formula} Σ (e)=te to events e.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Since we want to solve scheduling problems using STNs, we assume that for each {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T there is a finite interval for scheduling it.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular this means that for each STN {a mathematical formula}S=(T,C) we assume that for all {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T, {a mathematical formula}t ≥ z holds and there exists a finite constant (horizon) {a mathematical formula}hS such that for all {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T it holds that {a mathematical formula}t ≤ hS.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This avoids the use of unbounded time intervals such as {a mathematical formula} − ∞ ≤ ti − tj ≤ ∞ .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let{a mathematical formula}S=(T,C)be an STN and let{a mathematical formula}flexnbe a flexibility metric satisfyingF1 – F3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then{a mathematical formula}flexn=flexN.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Given an STN {a mathematical formula}S=(T,C), a set {a mathematical formula}IS={It=[lt,ut]|t ∈ T} of (non-empty) intervals for the time point variables {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T is an interval schedule for S iff for every {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T and every {a mathematical formula}vt ∈ [lt,ut], the assignment Σ defined by {a mathematical formula} Σ (t)=vt is a schedule for S.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It is not difficult to show that any flexibility metric flex satisfying the postulates F1, F2 and {a mathematical formula}F2 ′ defines an interval schedule {a mathematical formula}IS={It|t ∈ T} for an STN S if we define the correspondence {a mathematical formula}IS={flex(t)|t ∈ T}:</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let{a mathematical formula}S=(T,C)be an STN.The function{a mathematical formula}flex:T → {[m,n]: − ∞ <m ≤ n< ∞ }satisfies the postulatesF1,F2and{a mathematical formula}F2 ′ iff the set of intervals{a mathematical formula}IS={flex(t)|t ∈ T}is an interval schedule for S.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">From this proposition it follows that to compute a flexibility metric for an STN {a mathematical formula}S=(T,C) satisfying F1, F2, {a mathematical formula}F2 ′ and F3, we have to determine</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">an interval schedule {a mathematical formula}IS={[lt,ut]|t ∈ T} for S, such that</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To solve the first problem (computing an interval schedule) we use a transformation from a given STN to another STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ and we show that any schedule obtained for the latter can be used to obtain an interval schedule for the former.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Note that the resulting set of variables and constraints is just another STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ , we call a double STN.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Using Proposition 5, we show that the schedules of this double STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ can be used to construct an interval schedule for the original STN S:</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let{a mathematical formula}S=(T,C)be an STN.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Consider the double STN{a mathematical formula}S ′ =(T ′ ,C ′ )derived from S as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula}Then, for every solution{a mathematical formula} Σ ′ of{a mathematical formula}S ′ , the set{a mathematical formula}IS={[ Σ ′ (t − ), Σ ′ (t+)]|t ∈ T}is an interval schedule for S.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">First, remember that we always assume a given S to be consistent.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We will show that {a mathematical formula}S ′ is consistent, too.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Take an arbitrary schedule Σ for S and construct an assignment {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ for {a mathematical formula}S ′ as follows: for every {a mathematical formula}t ∈ T, let {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ (t+)= Σ (t − )= Σ (t).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">It is obvious that {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ will satisfy all constraints in {a mathematical formula}C ′ , hence {a mathematical formula}S ′ is consistent.Therefore, we can assume some arbitrary schedule {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ for {a mathematical formula}S ′ .</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We show that {a mathematical formula}{[ Σ ′ (t − ), Σ ′ (t+)]|t ∈ T} is an interval schedule for S. Take some arbitrary constraint {a mathematical formula}tj − ti ≤ cij in C. By Proposition 5, it is sufficient to show that {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ (tj+) − Σ ′ (ti − ) ≤ cij.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">But this is immediate as by construction of {a mathematical formula}C ′ , {a mathematical formula}tj+ − ti − ≤ cij is a constraints in C and {a mathematical formula} Σ ′ is a schedule for {a mathematical formula}S ′ .</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Consider the STN {a mathematical formula}S2 presented in Example 1.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Let STN {a mathematical formula}S2 ′ =(T ′ ,C ′ ) be the double STN derived from S where{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} One possible schedule for {a mathematical formula}S2 is{a mathematical formula} This schedule can be used to construct the following interval schedule for S:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The transformation of an STN S into a double STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ can be used to obtain an interval schedule for S. An arbitrary interval schedule, however, does not suffice to determine the flexibility of an STN, since the sum of the sizes of the intervals obtained does not need to be maximal and therefore does not satisfy F3.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Hence, to obtain the flexibility of an STN, we have to select those solutions Σ for the double STN {a mathematical formula}S ′ that maximize the sum of the sizes of the intervals.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Question: Is there a schedule {a mathematical formula} Σ f:Tc → R for the controllable events {a mathematical formula}ti ∈ Tc such that for every choice of values {a mathematical formula} Ω 1, … , Ω n such that {a mathematical formula} Ω j ∈ [lj,uj] for {a mathematical formula}j=1, … ,n, the function Σ defined by{a mathematical formula} is a schedule for the STN {a mathematical formula}Sc=(Tc ∪ Tu,Cf)?</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Question: Is there a set {a mathematical formula}Ic={Itic:ti ∈ Tc} of intervals for the controllable events such that for every choice of time points {a mathematical formula} Ω 1, … , Ω n such that {a mathematical formula} Ω j ∈ [lj,uj] for {a mathematical formula}j=1, … ,n, and every choice {a mathematical formula}v0, … ,vm − 1 of values such that {a mathematical formula}vi ∈ Itic, the function Σ defined by{a mathematical formula} is a schedule for the STN {a mathematical formula}Sc=(Tc ∪ Tu,Cf)?</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">For every free constraint {a mathematical formula}t − t ′ ≤ c we should add the constraint {a mathematical formula}t+ − t ′ − ≤ c.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The problem to ensure that the merge Σ of individual schedules {a mathematical formula} Σ i for {a mathematical formula}Si is always a schedule of the original STN S is known as the so-called Temporal Decoupling Problem[15]:</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">For example, while {a mathematical formula}t1 − t2 ≤ 0, we have {a mathematical formula} Σ 1(t1) − Σ 2(t2)>0.</a>
