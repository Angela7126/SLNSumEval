<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula} Λ 0 is the initial state probability distribution.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It reaches the target state {a mathematical formula}target almost surely with an expected total cost of 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It follows that {a mathematical formula} Σ Allow is an almost-sure winning strategy for all belief supports in {a mathematical formula}BeliefWin(G,T).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have that {a mathematical formula} Σ Allow ∈ AlmostG(T).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We consider an upper bound {a mathematical formula}UAllow on the expected total cost of the strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ Allow starting in an arbitrary state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ U with the initial belief support {a mathematical formula}U ∈ BeliefWin(G,T).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As the strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ Allow is in {a mathematical formula}AlmostG(T) it follows that the value {a mathematical formula}UAllow is also an upper bound for the optimal cost {a mathematical formula}optAsCost.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that {a mathematical formula} Α k denotes the probability that the target state is not reached within the first k steps.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It follows that the expected number of steps to reach the target state T in POMDP {a mathematical formula}F(n) using strategy Σ is double exponential in the number of states of the POMDP.</a>
