<a href="#0" id="0">The status of the Erd Ő s discrepancy conjecture for {a mathematical formula}C=2 has been settled by the authors of this article [30], [31] by encoding the problem as a propositional satisfiability problem and using state of the art SAT solvers to prove that the longest ±1 sequence of discrepancy 2 contains 1160 elements.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A {a mathematical formula}13900 long ±1 sequence of discrepancy 3 was also constructed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A ±1 sequence of length n is a function {a mathematical formula}{1, … ,n} → { − 1,+1}.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We write {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn to denote a finite ±1 sequence of length n, and {a mathematical formula}(xn) to denote an infinite sequence.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We say that a ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xl is C-bounded, for some {a mathematical formula}C>0 if {a mathematical formula}| ∑ i=1jxi| ≤ C, for all {a mathematical formula}j:0<j ≤ l.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then the discrepancy of a finite ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn of length n is a minimal C such that for every {a mathematical formula}d:1 ≤ d ≤ ⌊ nC+1 ⌋ the subsequence {a mathematical formula}xd,x2d … ,x ⌊ n/d ⌋ ⋅ d is C-bounded.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, the discrepancy of the initial segment {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xm grows as {a mathematical formula} ⌊ m2 ⌋ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the proof by contradiction, suppose that the discrepancy of some ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,x12 is 1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As every ±1 sequence whose length does not exceed C is always C-bounded, in what follows we only consider cases of {a mathematical formula}l>C.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then by Proposition 4, {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1jI(pi)<k.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As the discrepancy of a ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn is bounded by C if, and only if, the discrepancy of {a mathematical formula} − x1, … , − xn is bounded by C, the permutation {a mathematical formula}l ↦ ¬l, where l is a literal, is a solution symmetry for the SAT encoding of the EDP.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Finally notice that the fact that {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn is multiplicative does not imply that {a mathematical formula} − x1, … , − xn is, so symmetry breaking described in Proposition 11 is not applicable for multiplicative and completely multiplicative sequences.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Thus we prove that the Erd Ő s discrepancy conjecture holds true for {a mathematical formula}C=2.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We establish that the length of a maximal ±1 completely multiplicative discrepancy 3 sequence coincides with the length of a maximal ±1 multiplicative discrepancy 3 sequence and is equal to {a mathematical formula}127645.</a>
