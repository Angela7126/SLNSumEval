<a href="#0" id="0">Here we show how we can add a number of typically used data mining constraints {a mathematical formula}must – link, {a mathematical formula}cannot – link, and {a mathematical formula}must – link – before as linear constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Though learning the merge function directly allows us to recover the dendrogram easily, it is difficult to define an objective around it.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, we introduce the binary variable {a mathematical formula}Oabc which is set to TRUE (value one) if the instances a and b are merged before a and c are merged.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While global {a mathematical formula}cannot – link or {a mathematical formula}must – link constraints have been shown to improve the performance of hierarchical clustering, they were designed for flat clustering and do not take into account the hierarchical nature of a dendrogram.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Another constraint type that was specifically devised for hierarchical clustering is the {a mathematical formula}must – link – before (MLB) constraints [23].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In some ways this constraint is less powerful than local {a mathematical formula}must – link constraints because they only specifies the relative ordering of how points should be merged.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However in practice local constraints are difficult to specify whereas it is generally easy to specify a {a mathematical formula}must – link – before constraint.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As Equation (11) shows, the definition of {a mathematical formula}MLB(a,b,c) is that points a and b must be merged before a and c or b and c.{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We created three artificial hierarchical clustering data sets with a known ground truth hierarchies, so that we could use them to precisely answer important questions about our new hierarchical clustering formulation.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Since we often injected noise into our experiments many times we created small data sets so experiments can be repeated many times.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The F1 score is commonly used to compare clustering results to ground truth clusters by first matching the clusters from the two different sets and then calculating:{a mathematical formula} We measured F1 score by first calculating the set of all clusters generated within the ground truth and learned dendrograms, and then matching the learned clusters with the best true clusters.</a>
