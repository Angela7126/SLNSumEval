<a href="#0" id="0">The theory does support the inference that if it is inside an open container when dropped, it will remain inside the container, and not come into contact with any object outside the container.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If an object is in an upright open container, and the agent moves the container and keeps it upright, then the object will remain in the container.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section we present a partial, qualitative theory of an object moving and of an agent manipulating an object.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">— The agent can grasp object o at time t.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Grasps(ta,tb,o) ⇔ Lt(ta,tb) ∧ ∀ tLt(ta,t) ∧ Leq(t,tb) ⇒ Grasp(t,o).The agent grasps object o from time ta (non-inclusive) to time tb (inclusive).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For instance, if a container remains motionless over a time interval and the agent remains outside, then the set of objects inside is causally isolated.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">NoPartialContents(t:Time;o:Object) — No objects except possibly the agent are partially contained in the open container o at time t.</a>
