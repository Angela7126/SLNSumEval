<a href="#1" id="1">Consider the {a mathematical formula}M-based residual set given in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A diagnosis model defined with these residuals is diagnosable when both fault signatures and residual orderings are used (without orderings, faults {a mathematical formula}Re1+, {a mathematical formula}Re2+, and {a mathematical formula}Re3+ have all the same signatures and cannot be distinguished from one another).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that the definition of local diagnosability for a diagnosis submodel is equivalent to the definition of diagnosability for a diagnosis model (Definition 16).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For a set of diagnosis submodels, local diagnosability is not a strong enough condition to ensure global correctness.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The problem is that for two different diagnosis submodels, {a mathematical formula}Si and {a mathematical formula}Sj, there may be some faults {a mathematical formula}fi ∈ Fi and {a mathematical formula}fj ∈ Fj, such that both {a mathematical formula}fi and {a mathematical formula}fj produce the same effects on {a mathematical formula}Ri.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, if fault {a mathematical formula}fj occurs in the system, the local diagnoser for {a mathematical formula}Si will think that fault {a mathematical formula}fi has occurred, which is not globally correct, i.e., we may have faults that are distinguishable from faults inside the diagnosis submodel, but not distinguishable from faults outside the diagnosis submodel.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">That is, a diagnosis submodel {a mathematical formula}Si is globally diagnosable if all the faults {a mathematical formula}Fi are distinguishable from every other fault in F, i.e., all other faults in S, using only the residuals in {a mathematical formula}Ri.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this paper, we focus on the problem where the diagnosis model {a mathematical formula}S is diagnosable and the user provides the initial distribution of the measurement and fault sets.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{sup:12} Usually, each {a mathematical formula}Si may not be globally diagnosable.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The globally diagnosable diagnosis submodel design problem is defined as determining, for each {a mathematical formula}Si, the minimal set of residuals in the complete set of possible residuals, R, to achieve global diagnosability.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The same procedure to construct a correct centralized diagnoser applies to constructing a local diagnoser, as we simply use the diagnosis submodel with the local fault set {a mathematical formula}Fi and local residual set {a mathematical formula}Ri to obtain {a mathematical formula}DFi,Ri ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Example 24</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The local diagnosers for the diagnosis submodel design example from the previous section are given in Fig.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">9.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Recall that diagnosis submodels {a mathematical formula}S1 and {a mathematical formula}S2 need to add one residual to become globally diagnosable, and diagnosis submodel {a mathematical formula}S3 does not need any; whereas the centralized diagnoser needs all the global model residuals.</a>
