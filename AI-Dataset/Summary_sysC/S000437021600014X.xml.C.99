<a href="#0" id="0">The equation for the value iteration algorithm is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula} As demonstrated below, we obtain a strategy {a mathematical formula} Σ kFO=( Σ u, Σ n,M,m0) that is finite-horizon optimal for length k (here FO stands for finite-horizon optimal) from the above equation as follows: (i) the set of memory elements M is defined as {a mathematical formula}H×N; (ii) the initial memory state is {a mathematical formula}( Λ 0,k); (iii) for all {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ n ≤ k, the action selection function {a mathematical formula} Σ n((b,n)) selects an arbitrary action a such that {a mathematical formula}a=arg ⁡ mina ∈ Allow(Supp(b)) ⁡ [c ′ (b,a)+ ∑ b ′ ∈ H Ψ (b,a)(b ′ )Vn − 1 ⁎ (b ′ )]; and (iv) the memory update function given a memory state {a mathematical formula}(b,n), action a, and an observation o updates to a memory state {a mathematical formula}(b ′ ,n − 1), where {a mathematical formula}b ′ is the unique belief update from belief b under action a and observation z.</a>
