<a href="#0" id="0">Epistemic stage: this involves determination of what the agent engaged in the reasoning believes (or chooses to assume) about the current state and the joint action that will result from the choice of a particular individual action by the agent concerned;</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While problem formulation and the identification of the current state can be resolved using normal theoretical reasoning techniques, and the option selection stage can be carried out using value-based reasoning based on VAFs as described in [16], how the joint action should be determined in the epistemic stage is less obvious and is the topic of this paper.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now we can base arguments on the complete set of transitions containing an action, taking into account the likelihoods of all possible responses, rather than having to assume an action on the part of the other and then consider objections based on the potential performance of a different action.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The real advance here over previous work such as [19] is that there is no longer any need to make assumptions about what the other believes and prefers: the agent can now come to a decision using its own relative preferences between values, its own beliefs and the degree of risk it is prepared to take, whilst requiring no additional machinery: it uses only the AATS+V [19] based on its own beliefs, causal model and values [45].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Even where the action performed does affect values, as in [47], so that the intrinsic value of an action can be taken into account, what matters for the agent concerned is its own individual action, and so all transitions between the same pair of states containing that action will promote and demote the same values, as far as that agent is concerned.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, for our current purposes, we will consider all joint actions with the same action by the agent concerned leading to the same state to be equivalent, so that consideration can be limited to the different outcomes possible for a given action of the agent engaged in the reasoning, irrespective of how many joint actions reach each outcome.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Now, unlike previous work such as [19], there is no longer any need for the reasoning agent to make assumptions about the others' beliefs, domain conceptualisation and preferences that this other agent would use to choose a particular action: the reasoning agent will then be able to decide using its own relative preferences between values, its own beliefs and, where necessary, the particular degree of risk it is subjectively prepared to accept.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Argument (3) can be effective provided we can give reasons to suppose that probability of cooperation is in the desired range.</a>
