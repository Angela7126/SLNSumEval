<a href="#0" id="0">Here we show how we can add a number of typically used data mining constraints {a mathematical formula}must – link, {a mathematical formula}cannot – link, and {a mathematical formula}must – link – before as linear constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The popular agglomerative algorithms are easy to implement as they just begin with each point in its own cluster and progressively join two closest clusters to reduce the number of clusters by 1 until {a mathematical formula}k=1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now that we have presented a global objective function for hierarchical clustering we will address how to find globally optimum legal hierarchies by translating the problem into an integer linear program (ILP).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While global {a mathematical formula}cannot – link or {a mathematical formula}must – link constraints have been shown to improve the performance of hierarchical clustering, they were designed for flat clustering and do not take into account the hierarchical nature of a dendrogram.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In some ways this constraint is less powerful than local {a mathematical formula}must – link constraints because they only specifies the relative ordering of how points should be merged.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However in practice local constraints are difficult to specify whereas it is generally easy to specify a {a mathematical formula}must – link – before constraint.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We created three artificial hierarchical clustering data sets with a known ground truth hierarchies, so that we could use them to precisely answer important questions about our new hierarchical clustering formulation.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The F1 score is commonly used to compare clustering results to ground truth clusters by first matching the clusters from the two different sets and then calculating:{a mathematical formula} We measured F1 score by first calculating the set of all clusters generated within the ground truth and learned dendrograms, and then matching the learned clusters with the best true clusters.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our results in Table 3, Table 4 show that our method outperforms standard hierarchical clustering for real world language evolution and fMRI data sets for finding the best hierarchy (matching the ground truth).</a>
