<a href="#0" id="0">We call {a mathematical formula}O the set of observations available for the observables in {a mathematical formula}Q.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to index this set of observations, they will be represented as a sequence by defining an order relation between them.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This ordering aims to prioritize the interpretation of the observations as they appear.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Definition 6</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We devise an abstraction process as a knowledge-based reasoning process, supported by the notion of abstraction pattern, which brings together those elements required to perform an abstraction.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Formally: An abstraction pattern{a mathematical formula}P= 〈 h,MP,CP, Θ P 〉 consists of a hypothesis h, a set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP={m1, … ,mn}, a set of constraints {a mathematical formula}CP={C1, … ,Ct} among the findings and the hypothesis, and an observation procedure {a mathematical formula} Θ P(A1,T1b,T1e, … ,An,Tnb,Tne) ∈ O(h).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An abstraction pattern establishes, through the set {a mathematical formula}CP, the conditions for conjecturing the observation of h from a set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP, and through the observation procedure {a mathematical formula} Θ P, the calculations for producing a new observation {a mathematical formula}oh ∈ O(h) from the observation of these findings.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We call {a mathematical formula}MPq={m1q,m2q, … ,msq} the set of findings of the observable q in P, being {a mathematical formula}MP= ⋃ q ∈ QMPq.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, a set of findings allows the elements of a multiset of observables to be distinguished.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The interpretation procedure will choose, as we will see later, from the available observations for every observable q satisfying the constraints {a mathematical formula}CP, which are to be assigned to the findings in {a mathematical formula}MPq in order to calculate {a mathematical formula}oh.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In this section, we define and characterize an interpretation problem.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Informally, an interpretation problem arises from the availability of a set of initial observations from a given system, and of domain knowledge formalized as a set {a mathematical formula}G={Gq1, … ,Gqn} of {a mathematical formula}Gap grammars.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Every abstraction grammar {a mathematical formula}Gh ∈ G generates a set of abstraction patterns that share the same hypothesis h. The whole set of abstraction patterns that can be generated by {a mathematical formula}G is denoted as {a mathematical formula}P.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Definition 7</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Let {a mathematical formula}Q be a set of observables and {a mathematical formula}G a set of abstraction grammars.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We say {a mathematical formula}G induces an abstraction relation in {a mathematical formula}Q×Q, denoted by {an inline-figure} if and only if there exists an abstraction pattern P generated by some {a mathematical formula}Gh ∈ G such that:</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Definition 8</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">We define an abstraction model as a tuple {an inline-figure}, where {a mathematical formula}Q is the set of domain observables, {an inline-figure} is an abstraction relation between such observables, and {a mathematical formula}G is the available knowledge as a set of abstraction grammars.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Definition 9</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We define an interpretation problem as a pair {a mathematical formula}IP= 〈 O,M 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}O=(o1,o2, … ,oi, … ) is a sequence of observations requiring interpretation and {a mathematical formula}M is an abstraction model of the domain.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">As discussed above, any observable {a mathematical formula}q ∈ QP can appear multiple times as different pieces of evidence for an abstraction pattern P, in the form of findings collected in the set {a mathematical formula}MP.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">As a consequence, P can predict multiple observations of the set {a mathematical formula}O for a given observable {a mathematical formula}q ∈ QP, each of these corresponding to one of the findings of the set {a mathematical formula}MP through a matching relation.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">This matching relation is a matter of choice for the agent in charge of the interpretation task, by selecting from the evidence the observation corresponding to each finding in a given pattern.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Definition 10</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Given an interpretation problem IP, a matching relation for a pattern {a mathematical formula}P ∈ P is an injective relation in {a mathematical formula}MP×O, defined by {a mathematical formula}mq ↢ o if and only if {a mathematical formula}o= 〈 q,v,tb,te 〉 ∈ O(q) ⊆ O and {a mathematical formula}mq= 〈 Ψ ,A,Tb,Te 〉 ∈ MP, such that {a mathematical formula}(A1=v1, … ,Anq=vnq), {a mathematical formula}Tb=tb and {a mathematical formula}Te=te.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">From the notion of matching relation we can design a mechanism for abductively interpreting a subset of observations in {a mathematical formula}O through the use of abstraction patterns.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Thus, a matching relation for a given pattern allows us to hypothesize new observations from previous ones, and to iteratively incorporate new evidence into the interpretation by means of a hypothesize-and-test cycle.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The notion of abstraction hypothesis defines those conditions that a subset of observations must satisfy in order to be abstracted by a new observation, and makes it possible to incrementally build an interpretation from the incorporation of new evidence.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Definition 11</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Given an interpretation problem IP, we define an abstraction hypothesis as a tuple {a mathematical formula} Ħ = 〈 oh,P, ↢ 〉 , where {a mathematical formula}P= 〈 h,MP,CP, Θ P 〉 ∈ P, {a mathematical formula} ↢ ⊆ MP×O, and we denote {a mathematical formula}O Ħ =codomain( ↢ ), satisfying:</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">These conditions entail: (1) an abstraction hypothesis guesses an observation of the observable hypothesized by the pattern; (2) a new observation is obtained from the application of the observation procedure to those observations being assigned to the set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP by the matching relation; and (3) the observations taking part in an abstraction hypothesis must satisfy those constraints of the pattern whose variables are assigned a value by the observations.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">The set of observations that may be abstracted in an interpretation problem IP is {an inline-figure}, that is, observations corresponding to observables involved in the set of findings to be abstracted by some abstraction pattern.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">An abstraction hypothesis defines in the set of observations {a mathematical formula}O a counterpart of the subsets {a mathematical formula}AP and {a mathematical formula}EP of the set of findings {a mathematical formula}MP of a pattern P, resulting from the selection of a set of observations {a mathematical formula}O Ħ ⊆ O by means of a matching relation, satisfying those requirements shown in the Definition 11.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Definition 12</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Given an interpretation problem IP and an abstraction hypothesis {a mathematical formula} Ħ = 〈 oh,P, ↢ 〉 , we define the following sets of observations:</a>
<a href="#35" id="35">The definition of these sets can be generalized to include as arguments a set of observations {a mathematical formula}O={oh1, … ,ohm} from a set of abstraction hypotheses {a mathematical formula} Ħ 1, … , Ħ m:</a>
<a href="#36" id="36">As a result of an abstraction hypothesis, a new observation {a mathematical formula}oh is generated which can be included in the set of domain observations, so that {a mathematical formula}O=O ∪ {oh}.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">In this way, an interpretation can be incrementally built from the observations, by means of the aggregation of abstraction hypotheses.</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">Definition 13</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">Given an interpretation problem IP, an interpretation is defined as a set of abstraction hypotheses {a mathematical formula}I={ Ħ 1, … , Ħ m}.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">From a given interpretation problem IP, multiple interpretations can be abductively proposed through different sets of abstraction hypotheses.</a>
<a href="#41" id="41">Indeed, the definition of interpretation is actually weak, since even an empty set {a mathematical formula}I= ∅ is formally a valid interpretation.</a>
<a href="#42" id="42">Thus, we need additional criteria in order to select the solution to the interpretation problem as the best choice among different possibilities [33].</a>
<a href="#43" id="43">Definition 15</a>
<a href="#44" id="44">Given an interpretation problem IP, two different abstraction hypotheses Ħ and {a mathematical formula} Ħ ′ of the mutually exclusive observables {a mathematical formula}qh and {a mathematical formula}qh ′ are alternative hypotheses if and only if {a mathematical formula}abstracted_by(oh) ∩ abstracted_by(oh ′ ) ≠ ∅ .</a>
<a href="#45" id="45">Thus, {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) is an interpretation problem according to this definition.</a>
<a href="#46" id="46">On the other hand, {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) can be built in polynomial time.</a>
<a href="#47" id="47">In addition, for all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S there exists an abstraction hypothesis {a mathematical formula} Ħ = 〈 oh,P, ↢ 〉 such that:</a>
<a href="#48" id="48">Since each abstraction hypothesis involves a different abstraction pattern there are no alternative hypotheses in any interpretation of {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S).Suppose there is a set covering {a mathematical formula}C ⊆ S of U of size k or less.</a>
<a href="#49" id="49">For all {a mathematical formula}u ∈ U there exists {a mathematical formula}ci ∈ C − { ∅ } such that {a mathematical formula}u ∈ ci and, by the above construction, there exists {a mathematical formula} Ħ i ∈ I such that {a mathematical formula}abstracted_by(ohi)={u ∈ codomain( ↢ Ħ i)}={u ∈ ci}=ci, and therefore, {an inline-figure}.</a>
<a href="#50" id="50">That is, the set of abstraction hypotheses I is an exclusive cover of the interpretation problem {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) of size k or less.Following the same reasoning as for the set covering optimization problem, finding a minimal and a exclusive cover of an interpretation problem {a mathematical formula} Φ (U,S) is NP-hard, since we can use the solution of this problem to check whether there is an exclusive cover of the interpretation problem of size k or less, and this has been proven above to be NP-complete.</a>
<a href="#51" id="51">The solution set for an interpretation problem IP consists of all exclusive covers of IP having the minimum possible number of abstraction hypotheses.</a>
<a href="#52" id="52">Obtaining this solution set can be stated as a search on the set of interpretations of IP.</a>
<a href="#53" id="53">The major source of complexity of searching for a solution is the local selection, from the available evidence in {a mathematical formula}O, of the most appropriate matching relation for a number of abstraction hypotheses that can globally shape a minimal and exclusive cover of IP.</a>
<a href="#54" id="54">The selection of a value for the K parameter depends on the problem at hand.</a>
<a href="#55" id="55">We select its value as {an inline-figure}, that is, as the maximum number of observables that can be abstracted from any observable {a mathematical formula}qi.</a>
