<a href="#0" id="0">The first generalization, called regular similarity, is based on the definition of regular equivalence as an equivalence relation that commutes with the underlying graph edges [9].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On one hand, we show that the truth values of many-valued modal logic formulas are invariant with respect to generalized regular equivalence.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the other hand, we demonstrate that the maximum regular similarity between any two actors is equal to the minimum equivalence between degrees of the two actors satisfying many-valued modal logic formulas.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In Sections 3 and 4, we present the logical characterizations of regular similarity and generalized regular equivalence respectively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In practice, most SNA methods only consider a simplified version of a social network with binary relations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For ease of presentation, we focus on a social network with unary and/or binary relations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, the social network considered in this paper is a structure {a mathematical formula}N=(U,(Pi)i ∈ I,(Rj)j ∈ J), where the universe U is a finite set of actors; {a mathematical formula}Pi ⊆ U for all {a mathematical formula}i ∈ I; and {a mathematical formula}Rj ⊆ U×U for all {a mathematical formula}j ∈ J.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In terms of graph theory, {a mathematical formula}N is a labeled graph, where U is a set of nodes labeled with subsets of I, and each {a mathematical formula}Rj denotes a set of (labeled) edges.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For each {a mathematical formula}x ∈ U, the out-neighborhood and in-neighborhood of x with respect to a binary relation R, denoted respectively by Rx and {a mathematical formula}R − x, are defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} If E is an equivalence relation on U and x is an actor, the E-equivalence class of x is equal to its neighborhood, i.e., {a mathematical formula}[x]E=Ex=E − x.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Note that the latter equality holds because of the symmetry of E. For any {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ U, we use {a mathematical formula}[X]E to denote the set {a mathematical formula}{[x]E|x ∈ X}.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Several equivalence relations have been proposed for exploring the structural similarity between actors.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The first, proposed by Boyd and Everett [9], states that an equivalence relation E is a regular equivalence with respect to a binary relation R if it commutes with R; i.e.,{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}E ⋅ R={(x,y)| ∃ z ∈ U,(x,z) ∈ E ∧ (z,y) ∈ R} is the composition of E and R. By this definition, if E is a regular equivalence with respect to R and {a mathematical formula}(x,y) ∈ E, then for each {a mathematical formula}z ∈ Rx(resp.R − x), there exists {a mathematical formula}z ′ ∈ Ry(resp.R − y) such that {a mathematical formula}(z,z ′ ) ∈ E.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">It states that an equivalence relation E is a regular equivalence with respect to a binary relation R if for {a mathematical formula}x,y ∈ U,{a mathematical formula} According to this definition, if x and y are regularly equivalent, they are connected to equivalent neighborhoods.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Then, E is a regular equivalence with respect to {a mathematical formula}N if</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">A Kripke model for PML is a triple {a mathematical formula}M=(W,R,V), where W is a set of possible worlds, R is a binary relation on W, called an accessibility relation, and {a mathematical formula}V:W×PV → {0,1} is a truth assignment for evaluating the truth value of each propositional symbol in each world.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The satisfaction of a formula Φ in a world w of the model {a mathematical formula}M, denoted by {a mathematical formula}M,w ⊨ Φ , is defined by the following clauses:</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">A Kripke model for PMML is a triple {a mathematical formula}M=(W,(R Α ) Α ∈ REL,V), where W and V are the same as above, and for each {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ REL, {a mathematical formula}R Α is a binary relation on W.

<a href="#19" id="19">Formally, a fuzzy set P on the domain U is a membership function {a mathematical formula}P:U → [0,1].</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Alternatively, a fuzzy set can be represented as a class of crisp sets {a mathematical formula}{Pc|c ∈ [0,1]}, where {a mathematical formula}Pc={u ∈ U|P(u) ≥ c} is called the c-cut of P.

<a href="#23" id="23">Obviously, a fuzzy binary relation is a generalization of a binary relation, so the upper-case letters {a mathematical formula}R,S,T, etc., are used to denote both fuzzy and crisp relations.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Because we only consider fuzzy binary relations in this paper, we call them fuzzy relations hereafter; and the term “ binary relation ” means crisp relations only.</a>

<a href="#30" id="30">Although the membership degrees of fuzzy sets and relations may be any real numbers from the unit interval, in practice, the weights in a weighted social network are rarely irrational numbers.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">Thus, we further assume that the membership degrees of {a mathematical formula}Pi's and {a mathematical formula}Rj's are all rational.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">Such a similarity is called a regular similarity.</a>

<a href="#123" id="123">Thus, the degenerated weighted social network is simply a set of fuzzy interpretations for these two propositional logics.</a>
<a href="#124" id="124">We have shown several negative results for the generalizations of Theorem 2, but the situation is more encouraging in the case of GRE.</a>
<a href="#125" id="125">As above, we can extend {a mathematical formula}P( □ ◇ ) to {a mathematical formula}P Δ ( □ ◇ ) and {a mathematical formula}P ∼ ( □ ◇ ) with the Baaz Delta operator or the involutive negation.</a>
<a href="#126" id="126">However, in {a mathematical formula} Ł ( □ ◇ ), the negation defined by {a mathematical formula}¬ Φ = Φ → 0¯ is semantically equivalent to the involutive negation ∼ , so the Gödel negation is missing in {a mathematical formula} Ł ( □ ◇ ).</a>
<a href="#127" id="127">Thus, we only need to extend {a mathematical formula} Ł ( □ ◇ ) to {a mathematical formula} Ł Δ ( □ ◇ ) with the Baaz Delta operator.</a>
<a href="#128" id="128">Then, the Gödel negation can be defined as {a mathematical formula} Δ ¬ Φ in {a mathematical formula} Ł Δ ( □ ◇ ).</a>
<a href="#129" id="129">Let us define {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence and {a mathematical formula} Δ L-equivalence on the universe of actors in the same way as above for any {a mathematical formula}L=P ∼ ( □ ◇ ),P Δ ( □ ◇ ), {a mathematical formula} Ł Δ ( □ ◇ ),P ∼ ( ◇ ),P Δ ( ◇ ), {a mathematical formula} Ł Δ ( ◇ ).</a>
<a href="#130" id="130">In general, a t-conorm ⊕ that corresponds to a t-norm ⊗ is defined as {a mathematical formula}a ⊕ b=1 − (1 − a) ⊗ (1 − b) for any {a mathematical formula}a,b ∈ [0,1].</a>
<a href="#131" id="131">Let us consider the weighted social network {a mathematical formula}N=(U,P,R) shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#132" id="132">2(b) would be a counterexample of Theorem 6 if we use the product t-conorm (i.e., {a mathematical formula}a ⊕ b=a+b − a ⋅ b) in the definition of GRE and the semantics of the modal formulas.</a>
<a href="#133" id="133">Then, for any query Φ (i.e., a formula of {a mathematical formula}L) with respect to the network {a mathematical formula}N, the answer set is {a mathematical formula}ans( Φ ,N)={(x,deg(x, Φ ))|x ∈ U,deg(x, Φ ) ≠ 0}, where {a mathematical formula}deg(x, Φ ) is the degree of satisfaction of Φ for an actor x.</a>
<a href="#134" id="134">Because de is an isomorphism, we have {a mathematical formula}V(Xi, Φ )=V(de(Xi), Φ ) for {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≤ k and {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ L, where the truth value of a formula in an equivalence class is defined in the proof of Theorem 3.</a>
<a href="#135" id="135">Furthermore, for {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ i ≠ j ≤ k, there exists a formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ L such that {a mathematical formula}V(Xi, Φ ) ≠ V(Xj, Φ ).</a>
<a href="#136" id="136">This means that an attacker can identify each equivalence class {a mathematical formula}Xi on U with its corresponding equivalence class {a mathematical formula}de(Xi) on W, even though he can not identify {a mathematical formula}de(x) for any individual {a mathematical formula}x ∈ U.</a>
<a href="#137" id="137">Another case of privacy invasion occurs when there exists an equivalence class {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ U such that for all {a mathematical formula}u ∈ X, {a mathematical formula}Pi(u) is the same for some {a mathematical formula}i ∈ Is.</a>
<a href="#138" id="138">In this case, the attacker knows {a mathematical formula}N0 and X's corresponding equivalence class {a mathematical formula}Y=de(X) ⊆ W; therefore, he can evaluate the truth value of the confidential attribute {a mathematical formula}Pi with respect to each element of Y and derive that {a mathematical formula}Pi(u)=Pi(w) for any {a mathematical formula}w ∈ Y and {a mathematical formula}u ∈ X because de is an isomorphism.</a>
<a href="#139" id="139">Consequently, the attacker can determine the membership value of u in the confidential attribute {a mathematical formula}Pi for any {a mathematical formula}u ∈ X.</a>
<a href="#140" id="140">Formal definitions of privacy criteria based on the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation can be found in [37], [38].</a>
<a href="#141" id="141">From the above analysis, it is clear that the data center must compute the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation on {a mathematical formula}N for the privacy assessment.</a>
<a href="#142" id="142">However, because the number of formulas of a logical language is infinite in general, the direct computation of the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation is not effective.</a>
<a href="#143" id="143">In other words, to directly determine if two actors x and y are {a mathematical formula}L-equivalent, we have to evaluate and compare {a mathematical formula}V(x, Φ ) and {a mathematical formula}V(y, Φ ) for each formula Φ in {a mathematical formula}L. However, because the number of formulas is infinite, it is impossible to complete the process in a finite number of steps.</a>
<a href="#144" id="144">However, by using the characterization results provided in this paper, the computation of the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation can be reduced to the computation of the corresponding GRE or regular similarity of {a mathematical formula}L. In [27], [28], an effective procedure is presented for the computation of GRE and regular similarity over Gödel structure.</a>
<a href="#145" id="145">More general algorithms that compute GRE and regular similarity over any complete residuated lattices by solving systems of fuzzy relation equations are provided in [16], [17], [39], [40].</a>
<a href="#146" id="146">Therefore, the {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence relation can be computed effectively.</a>
<a href="#147" id="147">Although the analysis of the complexity of these algorithms and their computational properties are beyond the scope of the paper, we remark that the algorithms are based on an iterative refinement procedure proposed in [7] for computing the coarsest regular equivalence of an ordinary social network, which has {a mathematical formula}O(n3)-time complexity.</a>
<a href="#148" id="148">A more sophisticated algorithm with {a mathematical formula}O(mlog2n)-time complexity exists for an ordinary social network, where m and n are, respectively, the number of links and the number of nodes in the network [45].</a>
<a href="#149" id="149">Therefore, it would be worthwhile exploring the generalization of this more efficient algorithm to the computation of regular similarity and GRE.</a>
<a href="#150" id="150">As an example, let the query language {a mathematical formula}L be a {a mathematical formula}G Δ ( □ ◇ ) language with the alphabet {a mathematical formula}REL={ Α j|j ∈ J} and {a mathematical formula}PV={pi|i ∈ I − Is}.</a>
<a href="#151" id="151">In general, our results show that the computation of {a mathematical formula}L-equivalence can be reduced to the computation of GRE if the query language {a mathematical formula}L is one of the languages mentioned in Theorem 3, Theorem 4; and it can be reduced to the computation of regular similarity if the query language is {a mathematical formula}G( □ ◇ ) or {a mathematical formula}G( ◇ ).</a>
<a href="#152" id="152">In addition to complete axiomatizations, the finite model property and the decidability of Gödel modal logics are investigated in [11], [12], [13], [53].</a>
<a href="#153" id="153">Syntactically, our modal language {a mathematical formula}G( □ ◇ ) is simply a multi-modal extension of the Gödel modal logics presented in [11], [12], [13], [53].</a>
