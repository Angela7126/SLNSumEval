<a href="#0" id="0">We say that l is strictly derived from X wrt K, denoted by {a mathematical formula}X ⊢ Kl, iff {a mathematical formula}l ∈ X or l is the conclusion of an argument constructed according to Definition 2 where in step 1 only elements from {a mathematical formula}Xdom are used and in step 2, only the strict rules from K are used.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Attack relationAn attack relation for a knowledge base K is a relation {a mathematical formula}att ⊆ ARK×ARK such that there is no attack against strict arguments, i.e.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">att is said to satisfy the consistency postulate iff for each complete extension E of {a mathematical formula}(ARK,att), the set {a mathematical formula}cnl(E) of conclusions of arguments in E is consistent.att is said to satisfy the closure postulate iff for each complete extension E of {a mathematical formula}(ARK,att), the set {a mathematical formula}cnl(E) of conclusions of arguments in E is closed.att is said to satisfy the subargument closure postulate iff for each complete extension E of {a mathematical formula}(ARK,att), E contains all subarguments of its arguments.For ease of reference, the above three postulates are often referred to as</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}E ′ be the set of all arguments generated by E. It is clear that</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Inconsistency resolvingWe say attack relation att satisfies the inconsistency-resolving property for K iff for each finite set of arguments {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ ARK, if S is inconsistent then S is attacked (wrt att) by some argument generated by S.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As we will show later, the inconsistency-resolving property is satisfied by common conditions like closure under transposition or contradiction or the property of self-contradiction.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">How could we determine the attack relation for {a mathematical formula}K0?As both {a mathematical formula}A2,A3 belong to both {a mathematical formula}ARK, {a mathematical formula}ARK0 and the two knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K0,K have identical rule-based system, we expect that the attack relations between their common arguments should be identical.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Context-independenceWe say attack relation assignment atts for a rule-based system {a mathematical formula}R satisfies the property of context-independence iff for any two knowledge bases {a mathematical formula}K,K ′ ∈ CR and for any two arguments A, B from {a mathematical formula}ARK ∩ ARK ′ , it holds that {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ atts(K) iff (A,B) ∈ atts(K ′ ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The normal attack relation assignment{a mathematical formula}attsnr is defined by: For any knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ R and any arguments {a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ ARK, {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ attsnr(K) if and only if A undercuts B or A normal-rebuts B.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If {a mathematical formula}AttR exists then it is weakly regular and hence {a mathematical formula}AttR ⊆ WattR.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">From the first assertion in Theorem 1, it follows immediately that {a mathematical formula}WattR also satisfies the inconsistency-resolving property.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Therefore {a mathematical formula}WattR is regular.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Hence {a mathematical formula}WattR ⊆ AttR.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Thus {a mathematical formula}WattR=AttR.Assertion 3 follows immediately from second assertion and the second statement in Theorem 3.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">It is clear that assertion (2) follows immediately from assertion (1) and the definition of {a mathematical formula}AttR.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We hence need only to prove assertion (1).Let E be a stable extension of {a mathematical formula}(ARK,atts(K)).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">From Lemma 2, Lemma 16, it is clear that E is also conflict-free wrt {a mathematical formula}atts ′ (K).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">As E attacks each argument in {a mathematical formula}ARK ∖ E wrt {a mathematical formula}atts(K) and {a mathematical formula}atts(K) ⊆ atts ′ (K), it is obvious that E attacks each argument in {a mathematical formula}ARK ∖ E wrt {a mathematical formula}atts ′ (K).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">E is hence stable wrt {a mathematical formula}atts ′ (K).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In [23], a natural property of irrelevance of redundant defaults stating that adding a defeasible rule of the form ⇒ f to a knowledge base K for any evidence {a mathematical formula}f ∈ BEK should not change its semantics is presented and shown that it is satisfied by attack relation assignments satisfying the properties of attack monotonicity and context-independence.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Further let {a mathematical formula}Xdom=X ∩ Ldom.We say that l is strictly derived from X wrt K, denoted by {a mathematical formula}X ⊢ Kl, iff {a mathematical formula}l ∈ X or l is the conclusion of an argument constructed using only elements from {a mathematical formula}Xdom and the strict rules from K.{sup:25}The closure of a set {a mathematical formula}X ⊆ L wrt knowledge base K, denoted by {a mathematical formula}CNK(X), is defined by {a mathematical formula}CNK(X)={l|X ⊢ Kl}.X is said to be closed wrt K iff {a mathematical formula}X=CNK(X).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">For extended rule-based systems, we define normal attack relation assignments in the same way as before, namely, for any extended knowledge base {a mathematical formula}K ∈ ER and any arguments {a mathematical formula}A,B ∈ ARK, {a mathematical formula}(A,B) ∈ attsenr(K) if and only if A undercuts or undermines B or A normal-rebuts B where the definition of normal-rebuts is the same like in section 5.2.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">From the Lemma 23, it follows that there exists an argument B with conclusion ¬x and {a mathematical formula}Prem(B) ⊆ Prem(A0) ∪ {¬ Λ }.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Let A be the argument obtained by replacing each subargument of the form {a mathematical formula}[¬ Λ ] in B by argument {a mathematical formula}A1.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">It is clear that {a mathematical formula}Prem(A) ⊆ X and the conclusion of A is ¬x.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Suppose every attack relation assignment {a mathematical formula}atts ∈ A satisfies the inconsistency-resolving property.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">From Theorem 1, it follows immediately that {a mathematical formula}atts0 also satisfies the inconsistency-resolving property.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Let {a mathematical formula}R=(RS,RD, ⪯ ).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Further let {a mathematical formula}R ′ =(RS,RD, ∅ ).</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Let {a mathematical formula}attsnr ′ be the normal attack relation assignment wrt {a mathematical formula}R ′ .</a>
