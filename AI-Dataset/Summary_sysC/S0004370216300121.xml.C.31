<a href="#1" id="1">Merging values {a mathematical formula}a,b ∈ D(x) in a binary CSP consists in replacing {a mathematical formula}a,b in {a mathematical formula}D(x) by a new value c which is compatible with all variable-value assignments compatible with at least one of the assignments {a mathematical formula} 〈 x,a 〉 or {a mathematical formula} 〈 x,b 〉 .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A value-merging condition is a polytime-computable property {a mathematical formula}P(x,a,b) of assignments {a mathematical formula} 〈 x,a 〉 , {a mathematical formula} 〈 x,b 〉 in a binary CSP instance I such that when {a mathematical formula}P(x,a,b) holds, the instance {a mathematical formula}I ′ obtained from I by merging {a mathematical formula}a,b ∈ D(x) is satisfiable if and only if I is satisfiable.</a>
