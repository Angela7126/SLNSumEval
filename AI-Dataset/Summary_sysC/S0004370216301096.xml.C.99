<a href="#0" id="0">Their approach corresponds to using {a mathematical formula} ℓ -best-OWA-Winner, for some constant ℓ (however their model is a bit different because they derive utilities from distances between the agents, whereas in our case the utilities can be arbitrary).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These results apply, for example, to the case of geometric progression OWAs, {a mathematical formula} ℓ -best OWAs, and {a mathematical formula} ℓ -med OWAs (for fixed values of ℓ ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Further, when applied to the case of Borda-based utilities (which, as we have argued in Section 2.2, are non-finicky in a very strong sense), we obtain polynomial-time approximation schemes (that is, approximation algorithms that can compute solutions with an arbitrarily good precision, but whose running time depends polynomially only on the size of the problem but not necessarily on the desired approximation ratio).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let I be an instance of the Densest-K-Subgraph problem with graph {a mathematical formula}G=(V,E) and positive integer K. From I we construct an instance {a mathematical formula}I ′ of Α -OWA-Winner, where the set of agents N is E, the set of items is {a mathematical formula}A=V ∪ {d1, … ,d ℓ − 2} (or V if {a mathematical formula} ℓ =2), and we seek a winner set of size {a mathematical formula}K+ ℓ − 2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">[8], has approximation ratio {a mathematical formula}O(n1/4+ Ε ), where n is the number of vertices in the input graph.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As a further evidence that OWAs that are not nonincreasing are particularly hard to deal with from the point of view of approximation algorithms, we show that for an extreme example of an OWA family, i.e., for the K-med OWAs, there is a very strong hardness-of-approximation result.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{a mathematical formula}Hurwicz[ Λ ]-OWA-Winneris NP-hard.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The reader may wonder why for the case of {a mathematical formula}Hurwicz[ Λ ] OWA we only obtain NP-hardness and not inapproximability.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The reason is that due to the added dummy candidate it is easy to find a winner set with nonnegligible utility.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In fact, this is a general property of the {a mathematical formula}Hurwicz[ Λ ] OWA and we show an approximation algorithm for it with a constant approximation ratio.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We reach a contradiction and we conclude that {a mathematical formula}d1 must have been a member of W. An analogous argument shows that {a mathematical formula}d2 belongs to W as well.As the result of the above reasoning, we infer that each set of winners consists of {a mathematical formula}d1, {a mathematical formula}d2, and K items from V. Whenever both {a mathematical formula}d1 and {a mathematical formula}d2 are included in the set of winners and neither item from H is, the total utility of the dummy agents is the same, irrespective which items from V are selected.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We obtain it in the same way as the previous bound, except that we note that due to our {a mathematical formula}(K+1)-best-OWA, the utility derived by {a mathematical formula}ei1 can take into account at most {a mathematical formula}K+1 agents from the top-{a mathematical formula}(m+2) positions of the preference order of {a mathematical formula}ei1.Based on these upper bounds, we will now show that if the total utility derived from W by the agents in {a mathematical formula}NE is {a mathematical formula}nx(K+4), then C must correspond to a cover of all the edges of G. To this end, consider a situation where there is at least one edge {a mathematical formula}ei such that neither of the vertices that it connects belongs to C. By using our upper bounds, in this case the total utility of the agents from {a mathematical formula}NE can be at most:{a mathematical formula} (The last two lines follow directly by the definition of x.)</a>
