<a href="#0" id="0">The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain multiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability distribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make value-directed action choices.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The key contributions of this new theory are: (1) to represent sentiments as probability distributions over a continuous affective space, thereby allowing these sentiments to be dynamic and uncertain; (2) to propose a new kind of agent based on affect control theory that has the ability to learn affective identities of interactants; (3) to integrate the affective dynamics proposed by affect control theory with standard POMDP-based artificial intelligence; and (4) to introduce explicit utility functions to affect control theory that parsimoniously trade-off affective and propositional goals for a human-interactive agent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These contributions allow BayesAct to be used as an artificially intelligent agent: they provide the computerised agent with a mechanism for predicting how the affective state of an interaction will progress (based on affect control theory) and how this will modify the object of the interaction (e.g.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">EPA profiles of concepts can be measured with the semantic differential, a survey technique where respondents rate affective meanings of concepts on numerical scales with opposing adjectives at each end (e.g., {a mathematical formula}{good, nice} ↔ {bad, awful} for E; {a mathematical formula}{weak, little} ↔ {strong, big} for P; {a mathematical formula}{calm, passive} ↔ {exciting, active} for A).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Such transient shifts in affective meaning caused by specific events can be described with models of the form {a mathematical formula} Τ =MG(f), where {a mathematical formula}G and M are functions with statistically estimated parameters from empirical impression-formation studies where survey respondents rated EPA affective meanings of concepts embedded in a few hundred sample event descriptions such as the example above [1].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A POMDP consists of a finite set {a mathematical formula}X of states; a finite set {a mathematical formula}A of actions; a stochastic transition model {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁡ :X×A → Δ (X), with {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁡ (x ′ |x,a) denoting the probability of moving from state x to {a mathematical formula}x ′ when action a is taken, and {a mathematical formula} Δ (X) is a distribution over {a mathematical formula}X; a finite observation set {a mathematical formula} Ω x; a stochastic observation model with {a mathematical formula}Pr ⁡ ( Ω x|x) denoting the probability of making observation {a mathematical formula} Ω x while the system is in state x; and a reward assigning {a mathematical formula}R(x,a,x ′ ) to state transition x to {a mathematical formula}x ′ induced by action a.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Bayesian affect control theory (BayesAct for short) gives us a principled way to add the emotional content to a human interactive system by making four key additions to the basic POMDP model, as shown by the dashed lines in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We do not assume that this system state is directly observable, and so also use sets of observation variables {a mathematical formula} Ω x.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{sup:6} More precisely, we write the function {a mathematical formula}G for the case when it is the turn of the agent (given by {a mathematical formula}xw) as the {a mathematical formula}29×1 (column) vector (equivalent to (11.16) in [1]):{a mathematical formula} and for the case when it is the turn of the client it is the same, but with agent and client indices swapped on Τ (so {a mathematical formula} Τ a ⋅ → Τ c ⋅ and {a mathematical formula} Τ c ⋅ → Τ a ⋅ ):{a mathematical formula} The terms in these two functions are arrived at through an experimental procedure detailed in [94], and are those that have the most predictive power for the transient impressions in the empirical survey data.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The relative weighting and precise functional form of these two reward functions require further investigation, but in the examples we show can be simply defined.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The belief state can be used to compute expected values of quantities of interest defined on the state space, such as the expected deflection{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}D(s) is the deflection of s. This gives us a way to connect more closely with emotional “ labels ” from appraisal theories.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, if one wanted to compute the expected value of an emotion such as “ Joy ” in a situation with certain features (expectedness, events, persons, times), then the emotional content of that situation would be explicitly represented in our model as a distribution over the E – P – A space, {a mathematical formula}b(s), and the expected value of “ Joy ” would be {a mathematical formula}Eb(s)[Joy(s)]= ∫ sb(s)Joy(s), where {a mathematical formula}Joy(s) is the amount of joy produced by the fundamental and transient sentiment state s. In ACT, emotions are posited to arise from the difference between the transient and fundamental impressions of self-identity ({a mathematical formula} Τ a and {a mathematical formula}fa, respectively, in BayesAct).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">facial expressions) can be viewed as a method for communicating an agent's current appraisal of the situation in terms of affective identities that the agent perceives, and would be part of the action space {a mathematical formula}ba.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{a mathematical formula} Σ f is a set of parameters governing the strength of our prior beliefs that the identities of client and agent will remain constant over time.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Applications can also learn these mappings by assuming the human user will be behaving according to the affect control principle: whatever the user says can be mapped to the prediction of the theory (or close to it).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Full results are shown in Appendix C. To enable comparisons with Interact, we use action selection according to our generalised affect control principle only, using an average of 100 samples from Equation (32).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The probabilistic formulation in Equation (A.5), however, takes this one step further, and shows that the probability of {a mathematical formula}f ′ will assign higher weights to behaviours that minimize deflection, but in expectation of the state progression if it is not fully deterministic.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">If the prior over {a mathematical formula} Θ f is such that we expect identities to stay constant over time, as in Equation (25), we can derive a similar expression to (A.5), except it now includes the deflections of the fundamentals over identities:{a mathematical formula} We see that this is now significantly different than (A.5), as the relative weights of Ξ ({a mathematical formula} Β a and {a mathematical formula} Β c) and Ψ ( Α ) will play a large role in determining which fundamental sentiments are most likely.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Therefore, we have from Equation (B.2):{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} and therefore that the “ optimal ” behaviour, {a mathematical formula}fb ⁎ is{a mathematical formula} partially expanding out this is{a mathematical formula} Now we note that, the terms from [1] can be written as follows{a mathematical formula} and{a mathematical formula} so that{a mathematical formula} and that{a mathematical formula} so that {a mathematical formula}fb ⁎ is now{a mathematical formula} collecting terms and comparing to Equation (B.4), this give us exactly Equation (12.21) from [1]:{a mathematical formula} Similar equations for actor and object identities can be obtained in the same way by computing with partial derivatives keeping all other quantities fixed, and the result is equations (13.11) and (13.18) from [1].</a>
