<a href="#0" id="0">This paper presents an approach to creating a semantic map of an indoor environment incrementally and in closed loop, based on a series of 3D point clouds captured by a mobile robot using an RGB-D camera.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Based on a semantic model about furniture objects (represented in an OWL-DL ontology with rules attached), we generate hypotheses for locations and 6DoF poses of object instances and verify them by matching a geometric model of the object (given as a CAD model) into the point cloud.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The result, in addition to the registered point cloud, is a consistent mesh representation of the environment, further enriched by object models corresponding to the detected pieces of furniture.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We demonstrate the robustness of our approach against occlusion and aperture limitations of the RGB-D frames, and against differences between the CAD models and the real objects.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We evaluate the complete system on two challenging datasets featuring partial visibility and totaling over 800 frames.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The results show complementary strengths and weaknesses of processing each frame directly vs. processing the fully registered scene, which accord with intuitive expectations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">An impressive recent approach to the problem of 3D object mapping is the SLAM++ system by Salas-Moreno et al.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">[28], which performs real-time recognition of 3D furniture models in RGB-D data.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This allows them to build a 3D object map of the scene and use that map in the SLAM loop to simultaneously track the camera pose.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The key difference to our approach is that our system is applicable to arbitrary 3D data like point clouds from laser scanners and does not rely on the special structure of RGB-D frames.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This allows us to use arbitrary 3D sensors or use several registered frames as input to cope with the recognition of large objects that cannot be captured in a single frame.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We see our model-based object recognition method as an instance of a more general system architecture (Fig.</a>
