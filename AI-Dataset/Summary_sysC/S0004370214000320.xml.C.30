<a href="#0" id="0">TRAMP takes as inputs sets of action models from multiple source domains {a mathematical formula}{A1, … ,An}, bridges source and target domains based the Web and the plan traces, and outputs action models {a mathematical formula}A for the target domain.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We explore a novel transfer learning framework to learn action models in the planning community under the condition that there are only a few plan traces (i.e., training data) available in the target domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We explore a novel transfer learning approach which is composed of two phases.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The first phase is to transfer knowledge from source domains based on plan traces from the target domain.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Specifically, this phase automatically builds structure mappings between source and target domains that can best explain the plan traces from the target domain, and transfer knowledge to the target domain based on the built mappings.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For each action model set {a mathematical formula}Ai from source domain {a mathematical formula}Di, we encode {a mathematical formula}Ai with a set of formulas {a mathematical formula}Fi as is done by Step 3 of Algorithm 2.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">After that, we calculate the similarity between formulas in {a mathematical formula}F0 and {a mathematical formula}Fi, and accumulate the weights w of {a mathematical formula}F0, as is described by Steps 4 – 9 of Algorithm 5.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Note that in Step 5 of Algorithm 5, the procedure “ can_map ” returns true if the number of parameters of each literal in formulas s and t is the same; otherwise, it returns false.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the following, we will focus on Step 6 of Algorithm 5, about how to build the similarity function from across domains using Web search.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This similarity function is used to transfer knowledge from source domains to the target domain.</a>
