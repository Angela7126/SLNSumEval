<a href="#0" id="0">Similar to the implementation of SBDS [7], ReSBDS does not add symmetry breaking constraints for broken symmetries and a boolean variable {a mathematical formula}bhP is also constructed for each symmetry {a mathematical formula}h ∈ G at each node P representing whether {a mathematical formula}Eh is satisfied or not where E is the partial assignment of P. Along branching, {a mathematical formula}bhP is incrementally computed in the following way.</a>

<a href="#2" id="2">Symmetry breaking constraints added by ParSBDS but not by ReSBDS cannot prune solutions when both use the same static variable and value orderings.Consider the resulting search trees {a mathematical formula} ϒ P of ParSBDS and {a mathematical formula} ϒ R of ReSBDS.</a>
