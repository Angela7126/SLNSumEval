<a href="#0" id="0">To extend the third step of the Gelfond – Lifschitz definition to first-order formulas, we first extend the van Emden – Kowalski operator {a mathematical formula}TP(S), which is applicable only to a positive logic program P parameterized with a set S of ground atoms, to a new operator {a mathematical formula}T Π (O,N) that is applicable to a general logic program Π parameterized with two first-order theories O and N. As shall be seen below, the first parameter O of the extended operator {a mathematical formula}T Π (O,N) is used to express a set of rule heads in {a mathematical formula}ground( Π ), while the second parameter N used to express some constrains.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A model I of a normal logic program Π is an answer set under the standard answer set semantics if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(T Π I( ∅ ))if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − ))if and only if{a mathematical formula}I=lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The conditions listed in Corollary 1 for an answer set of a normal logic program do not apply to a logic program with first-order formulas, because in the latter case the fixpoint {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) (resp.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}lfp(T Π ( ∅ ,¬I − ))) would be a first-order theory instead of a set of ground atoms (e.g., see Example 7).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, these conditions suggest that instead of requiring each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I be included in {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )), answer sets of a logic program Π with first-order formulas can be defined by requiring that each{a mathematical formula}A ∈ Iis true in the fixpoint{a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − ))under the constraints{a mathematical formula}¬I − ; i.e., for each {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I, {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus the operator {a mathematical formula}T Π (O,N) (Definition 8) can be applied to logic programs with aggregate atoms in the same way as logic programs with first-order formulas, and Definition 9 directly extends to such logic programs, i.e., a model I of a logic program Π with aggregate atoms is a well-justified FLP answer set of Π if for every {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I, {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus A amounts in our framework to an aggregate atom{a mathematical formula}[27] showed that {a mathematical formula} Σ 2p-hardness of the FLP answer set semantics is present already for a ground normal logic program Π with polynomially computable ground aggregate atoms of form A, where m and the size of each {a mathematical formula}Fi are bounded by a constant k. However, for {a mathematical formula} Π ′ that is Π with all aggregate atoms A replaced by {a mathematical formula}A ′ , deciding the existence of a well-justified answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ lies in NP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let Π be a normal logic program with complex atoms and {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ be its guessing program.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let {a mathematical formula}I ˆ be an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ and I be its projection on Π .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We call {a mathematical formula}I ˆ a compatible set of Π , if for every replacement atom {a mathematical formula}EA in {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ , {a mathematical formula}EA ∈ I ˆ if and only if I satisfies the source complex atom A of {a mathematical formula}EA.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It is not hard to see that for every compatible set {a mathematical formula}I ˆ of Π , its projection I on Π is a model of Π , and that the projections of all compatible sets include all FLP answer sets of Π (see the proof of Theorem 21), hence all well-justified FLP answer sets of Π .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">First note that if a logic program Π has no answer set, which means Π is inconsistent, then everything is cautiously true in Π under the answer set semantics, i.e., any {a mathematical formula}l ∈ HB Π trivially belongs to every answer set of Π .Since p is a fresh atom not occurring in Π , Π and {a mathematical formula} Π 1 by construction have the same FLP and well-justified FLP answer sets, none of which contains p (which would not be founded).</a>
