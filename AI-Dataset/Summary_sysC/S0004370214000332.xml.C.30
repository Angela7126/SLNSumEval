<a href="#0" id="0">If this polynomial-time analysis does not solve the problem, an {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ algorithm is used to identify an optimal protein design.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To evaluate the efficiency of the CFN approach, we model the CPD problem using several combinatorial optimization formalisms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We compare the performance of the 0/1 linear programming and 0/1 quadratic programming solver cplex, the semidefinite programming based Boolean quadratic optimization tool biqmac, several weighted partial MaxSAT solvers, the Markov random field optimization solvers daoopt and mplp[80], and the CFN solver toulbar2, against that of a well-established CPD approach implementing {a mathematical formula}DEE/A ⁎ , on various realistic protein design problems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When the DEE algorithm does not significantly reduce the search space, the {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search tree can be too slow or memory demanding and the problem cannot be solved.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We assume, without loss of generality, that every CFN includes at least one unary cost function {a mathematical formula}wi per variable {a mathematical formula}i ∈ X and a nullary cost function {a mathematical formula}w ∅ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">All costs being non-negative, the value of this constant function, {a mathematical formula}w ∅ , provides a lower bound on the cost of any assignment.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Notice that {a mathematical formula}DEE1 is equivalent to DEE on problems with Boolean variables, such as MaxSAT.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For problems with non-Boolean domains, {a mathematical formula}DEE1 is still able to detect and prune several values per variable.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For n residues to optimize with d possible (amino acid, conformation) pairs, there are n unary and {a mathematical formula}n.(n − 1)2 binary cost functions that can be computed independently.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For every assignment {a mathematical formula}ir of every variable i, there is a Boolean variable {a mathematical formula}dir that is equal to 1 iff {a mathematical formula}i=r.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Additional constraints enforce that exactly one value is selected for each variable.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For every pair of values of different variables {a mathematical formula}(ir,js) involved in a binary energy term, there is a Boolean variable {a mathematical formula}pirjs that is equal to 1 iff the pair {a mathematical formula}(ir,js) is used.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Constraints enforce that a pair is used iff the corresponding values are used.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Several solvers were unable to solve any of the instances in the 9000 s allocated globally per problem for each approach (including any pre-processing used in the method such as DEE in the {a mathematical formula}DEE/A ⁎ approach).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Despite the compact associated models, neither cplex for the quadratic programming model, nor biqmac for the quadratic Boolean optimization model could solve any single instance in less than 9000 s. Similarly, most of the WPMS solvers failed to solve any instance, in either of the two encoding tested.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">To confirm this, we computed the number of nodes explored by osprey during {a mathematical formula}A ⁎ search.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Except for simple problems where DEE alone could solve the problem, osprey explored trees larger than those explored by ILP or CFN by several orders of magnitude.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">On problem 1DKT, it explored more than 10{sup:7} nodes while ILP/cplex solved the problem without search and toulbar2 explored 134 nodes.</a>
