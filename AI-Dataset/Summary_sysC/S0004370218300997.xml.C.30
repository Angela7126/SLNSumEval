<a href="#0" id="0">We denote the social welfare of the coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A) by {a mathematical formula}SW(P) (see, e.g., [35]):{a mathematical formula} When we need to explicitly identify the edges of the social network E (with the corresponding weight function) in a social welfare computation, we will write {a mathematical formula}SW(P,E).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We proceed to examine some aspects of the stability of {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ , the coalition structure that maximizes the social welfare, on general graphs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ does not necessarily belong to the k-coalitions-core, as illustrated in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We can also observe that for all {a mathematical formula}0< Α <2 the number of added edges is almost the same.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">That is, the given value of Α has almost no effect on the decision of whether to add specific edges or not and therefore on the structure of the resulting graph.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, a higher value of Α decreases the relative improvement in the social welfare (Fig.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">8), but the organizer will still benefit by adding (almost) the same number of edges.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In S1, because the weights are either 0 or 1, when the cost of adding edges is 0, it affects the coalition structure significantly compared to the higher edge costs.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The graph is continuous up to the point where the cost of adding edges is 2, which is the point of indifference between adding the edges and not adding them.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">K-C-Membership: Given: {a mathematical formula}G=(A,E, Ω ), the social network (E may contain positive and negative edges), and a coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">K-C-Find: Given: {a mathematical formula}G=(A,E, Ω ), the social network (E may contain positive and negative edges), and a natural number k (the number of coalitions).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">where {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ is a coalition structure maximizing the social welfare.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Initial state: A coalition structure maximizing the social welfare, {a mathematical formula}P ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The social welfare of the coalition structure returned by the heuristic is at least{a mathematical formula}SW ⁎ 2, where{a mathematical formula}SW ⁎ is the maximal social welfare.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Random: In 97% of the cases a member of the strict k-coalitions-core was found within {a mathematical formula}10,000 iterations.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">In 11% of the cases the initial coalition structure was not a member of the core, but if a member of the core was found it also had the maximal social welfare.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The average number of iterations was 36 steps.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">K-C-Add: Given: {a mathematical formula}G=(A,E, Ω ), the social network (E may contain positive and negative edges), a coalition structure {a mathematical formula}P ∈ Π k(A) (that contains exactly k coalitions), and a natural number q.</a>
