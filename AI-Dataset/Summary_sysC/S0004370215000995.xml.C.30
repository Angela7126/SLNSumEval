<a href="#0" id="0">This paper presents a meta-objective optimization approach, called Bi-Goal Evolution (BiGE), to deal with many-objective optimization problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Inspired by two observations: 1) the conflict between proximity and diversity requirements is aggravated with the increase of the number of objectives and 2) the Pareto dominance loses its effectiveness for a high-dimensional space but works well on a low-dimensional space, BiGE converts a given many-objective optimization problem into a bi-goal (objective) optimization problem regarding individuals' proximity and crowding degree, and then handles it using Pareto dominance in this bi-goal domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">BiGE treats an MOP with many objectives as a bi-goal optimization problem regarding minimizing the proximity of individuals towards the optimal direction and minimizing the crowding degree of individuals in the population.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">2, by conversion, some of the nondominated individuals A â€“ G in the objective space become comparable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the bi-goal space, only three individuals (C, A, and E) are Pareto nondominated (i.e., the best individuals in the population), given that C and A perform best in terms of proximity and crowding degree, respectively, and the performance of E can be regarded as the tradeoff between that of C and A.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In contrast, individual F, which performs poorly in both proximity and crowding degree, is dominated by most of the individuals in the population.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Conversion from an MOP with a number of objectives to a bi-goal problem involves an integration of the objectives.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In order to make the integration feasible (i.e., to be able to deal with an MOP with non-commensurable objective functions), in BiGE each objective of individuals is normalized (with respect to its minimum and maximum values in the current population) before estimating their proximity and crowding degree.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For convenience, in the description of the proposed algorithm, the objective value of individuals refers to their normalized objective value in the range {a mathematical formula}[0,1].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Algorithm 3 gives the environmental selection procedure of BiGE.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">First, individuals' performance regarding proximity and crowding degree is estimated (Steps 2 and 3).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This is because the density of individuals in this bi-goal space does not reflect their own performance.</a>
