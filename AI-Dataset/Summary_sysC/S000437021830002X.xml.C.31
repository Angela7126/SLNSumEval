<a href="#0" id="0">Given an ILP instance {a mathematical formula}I=(F, Η ), the primal graph {a mathematical formula}GI of I is the graph whose vertex set is the set X of variables in I, and two vertices {a mathematical formula}a,b are adjacent iff either there exists some {a mathematical formula}A ∈ F containing both a and b or {a mathematical formula}a,b both occur in Η with non-zero coefficients.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For the following considerations, we fix an ILP instance {a mathematical formula}I=(F, Η ) of size n along with a treedepth decomposition T of {a mathematical formula}GI with depth k. Given a variable set Y, the operation of omitting consists of deleting all inequalities containing at least one variable in Y and all variables in Y; formally, omitting Y from I results in the instance {a mathematical formula}I ′ =(F ′ , Η ′ ) where {a mathematical formula}F ′ =F ∖ F(Y) and {a mathematical formula} Η ′ is obtained by removing all variables in Y from Η .</a>
