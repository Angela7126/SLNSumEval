<a href="#0" id="0">The process of initiating a search round and publishing the next reservation value is associated with a cost Α whose value is fixed (e.g., the cost of issuing a new call for bids or the cost of broadcasting a message).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that this cost may actually be a function of N, but since N remains constant during the search, we can also consider this cost to be constant.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Obtaining the actual value of an agent also incurs some cost.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In its most general form, the cost of simultaneously obtaining the values of j other agents is {a mathematical formula} Β (j) (where {a mathematical formula} Β (0)=0 and {a mathematical formula} Β (j) is strictly increasing in j) [4], [15], [32].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The overall cost of a search round i is thus {a mathematical formula} Α + Β (j), where j is the number of agents that comply with {a mathematical formula}ri.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The expected accumulated cost of finding the best-valued agent when using strategy S is denoted {a mathematical formula}V(S).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The searcher ʼ s goal is therefore to derive a strategy {a mathematical formula}S ⁎ that minimizes {a mathematical formula}V(S).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the specific case in which the reservation values are chosen from a finite set of L values {a mathematical formula}{x1, … ,xL}, {a mathematical formula}xmin<xi<xi+1<xL=xmax for all i, the optimal strategy can be derived with the following dynamic programming formulation in {a mathematical formula}O(L2N) time:{a mathematical formula} Here, {a mathematical formula}C(l) is the cost of continuing the search if a search using reservation value {a mathematical formula}xl failed to obtain any applicable agent values.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}C(l) is solved for using backwards induction, each time determining what would be the best reservation value larger than {a mathematical formula}xl to use if {a mathematical formula}xl is part of the search sequence.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The optimal sequence and its expected cost is determined by {a mathematical formula}C(0).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Theorem 1</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The sequence of reservation values that minimizes the expected cost of an iterative threshold search is either{a mathematical formula}[r1=xmax]or an infinite sequence{a mathematical formula}[r1,r2, … ],{a mathematical formula}ri<ri+1<xmax,{a mathematical formula} ∀ i ⩾ 1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">An important result of the above analysis is that P is distribution independent.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">This means that the searcher only needs to solve for P once for fixed values of N, Α , and {a mathematical formula} Β (j).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">This also means that certain properties of the optimal strategy, such as the expected cost and the expected number of rounds, do not depend on the probability distribution.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">P is distribution independent because of the infinite nature of the optimal sequence.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">P takes the place of the cumulative conditional probability distribution in (5).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">It is set to a value that balances the cost obtaining several agent values with the expected cost of continuing a search.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Since the optimal strategy is an infinite sequence, the searcher is faced with the same problem each round and therefore attempts to make the same tradeoff each round.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">In contrast to Proposition 1, Proposition 2 states that the optimal strategy when there is no cost for initiating a new search round ({a mathematical formula} Α =0) is to increment the reservation value by the smallest amount possible, such that the expected number of values obtained is minimized.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">If an increasing threshold search is to improve search costs, then a two-step strategy {a mathematical formula}S=[r1,r2=xmax] alone will provide some improvement [9].</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">The expected total cost when using this strategy is:{a mathematical formula} in which {a mathematical formula}P=F(r1).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">The first two terms are the costs associated with the use of the first reservation value {a mathematical formula}r1, and the third term is the cost of obtaining all agent values if no values were obtained using {a mathematical formula}r1.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">The optimal two-step strategy is obtained by determining the value P that minimizes (15).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Fig.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">4 shows the expected cost, the expected number of search rounds, and the 99.9th percentile of the number of search rounds required to find the best-valued agent as a function of the number of agents N, for the different values of Α and function assignments to {a mathematical formula} Β (j).</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Note that the scale of the y-axis in the first set of charts varies with Α in order to improve visualization.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The figure also shows the reservation values to be used in each search round when {a mathematical formula}N=20.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">As expected, Α has a substantial effect on the search strategy and expected cost.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The reservation value increases as a function of Α , since the tradeoff associated with each reservation value accounts for a greater cost of continuing the search if no agent is found.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Although the expected number of search rounds decreases as a consequence, the expected cost still increases, due to the greater cost per round.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">For large values of Α and all {a mathematical formula} Β (j) cost functions, the reservation probability is set such that the expected number of search rounds is close to 1 due to the substantial cost of initiating a new search round.</a>
