<a href="#0" id="0">If ⊗ is continuous, then this equivalence determines the unique residuum{a mathematical formula} The residuum behaves like classical implication on the truth values 0 and 1 and is used to generalize the implication to fuzzy logics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We now describe how the property {a mathematical formula}P △ can be used to prove undecidability of {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -L. Recall that the idea is to add a set {a mathematical formula}OV ≠ W of axioms (as in (5)) to {a mathematical formula}OP so that every model {a mathematical formula}I is restricted to satisfy {a mathematical formula}VI(g( Ν )) ≁ WI(g( Ν )) for every {a mathematical formula} Ν ∈ N ⁎ , thus obtaining an ontology that is consistent if and only if {a mathematical formula}P has no solution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is important to keep in mind for the subsequent sections that this constitutes an additional condition that has to be verified before we can show undecidability of a given fuzzy DL {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -L. We also assume that {a mathematical formula} ⊗ -L satisfies {a mathematical formula}P △ , and for a given model {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}OP, g denotes the function mapping the nodes of {a mathematical formula}IP to elements of {a mathematical formula} Δ I given by the property.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the case that {a mathematical formula} ⊗ ′ = Ł , we denote our choice by {a mathematical formula} Ł (a,b), and similarly for {a mathematical formula} ⊗ ′ ={an inline-figure}.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Correspondingly, we denote the fuzzy description logic by {a mathematical formula} Ł (a,b)-L or {a mathematical formula}{an inline-figure}(a,b)-L.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The function g for a model {a mathematical formula}I of {a mathematical formula}OP can be constructed as in the proof of Theorem 12, with the exception that we define as {a mathematical formula}g( Ν i) that element {a mathematical formula}y ∈ Δ I whose existence is guaranteed by {a mathematical formula}OP, ⇝ → when we consider {a mathematical formula}x=g( Ν ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our main result is based on the function {a mathematical formula}1 that maps fuzzy truth values to crisp truth values by defining, for all {a mathematical formula}x ∈ [0,1],{a mathematical formula} Since ⊗ is a continuous t-norm without zero divisors, it follows from Lemma 4 that {a mathematical formula}1(x)= ⊖ ⊖ x for all {a mathematical formula}x ∈ [0,1].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The undecidability results for consistency of classical ontologies (the first row of Table 5) immediately carry over to this problem since the reduction uses only one individual name and consistency of a finite set {a mathematical formula}O of GCIs together with the crisp assertions {a mathematical formula} 〈 e0:C1 〉 , … , {a mathematical formula} 〈 e0:Cn 〉 is equivalent to the 1-satisfiability of the concept {a mathematical formula}C1 ⊓ ⋯ ⊓ Cn w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The idea to reduce consistency to consistency in classical DLs has been used for arbitrary finite chains of truth values with combination functions similar to ordinal sums of the Gödel and Ł ukasiewicz t-norms, and even for very expressive DLs such as {a mathematical formula}SROIQ[33], [34]; however, the reduction often increases the size of the input ontology by an exponential factor.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We first ensure that a fresh auxiliary concept name A has a value from {a mathematical formula}Enc(u) at all domain elements, and then require that C and A have the same value at e. For the first part, we use the two axioms{a mathematical formula} Observe that, whenever {a mathematical formula}HI(x) ∈ [0,b] for some interpretation {a mathematical formula}I and {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Δ I, then for every {a mathematical formula}m ∈ N we have by linearity of {a mathematical formula} Σ 0,b that{a mathematical formula} Let now {a mathematical formula}I be an interpretation that satisfies these axioms and {a mathematical formula}x ∈ Δ I.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The axioms for {a mathematical formula}Vi and {a mathematical formula}Wi ensure that they get the values {a mathematical formula}(1/2)vi=2 − vi=enc(vi) and {a mathematical formula}enc(wi), respectively, at all domain elements.It can now be shown similarly to Theorem 12 that this ontology satisfies the conditions of the canonical model property.</a>
