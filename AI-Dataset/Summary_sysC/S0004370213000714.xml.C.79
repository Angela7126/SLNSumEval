<a href="#0" id="0">A transferable utility coalitional game Γ is composed of a set {a mathematical formula}I={a1, … ,an} of {a mathematical formula}|I|=n agents, and a characteristic function mapping any subset (coalition) of the agents to a real value {a mathematical formula}v Γ :2I → R, indicating the total utility that these agents achieve together.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given a coalition C, it is simple to compute {a mathematical formula}S(C) in polynomial time, as the union of all the skills of the agents in C. Thus, we can compute the set of tasks {a mathematical formula}T(C) accomplished by that C: for each {a mathematical formula}tj ∈ T we check if {a mathematical formula}S(tj) ⊂ S(C).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By definition {a mathematical formula}p(C)= ∑ i ∈ Cpi, so finding the maximal excess coalition requires finding a subset of agents C whose skill set {a mathematical formula}S(C)= ⋃ i ∈ C ′ Si covers all skills S (i.e., {a mathematical formula} ⋃ i ∈ C ′ Si=S) and whose sum of payoffs {a mathematical formula}p(C)= ∑ i ∈ Cpi is minimal.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The above result holds even if the imputation is always the equal imputation where {a mathematical formula}pi=pj for any two agents {a mathematical formula}i,j, in which case ECM is equivalent to SET-COVER (rather than WSC).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The result holds even for the equal imputation when each skill is shared by exactly two agents (i.e., for any skill s we have exactly two agents who own that skill), in which case the ECM problem translates to the prominent NP-complete VERTEX-COVER problem [39].</a>
