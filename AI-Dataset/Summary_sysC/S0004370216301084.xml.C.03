<a href="#1" id="1">Consider any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ K such that {a mathematical formula} Φ (x) ≤ Φ (q)+ Ε and any {a mathematical formula}i ∈ N.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ K with {a mathematical formula} Φ (x) ≤ Φ (q)+ Ε .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, in the more challenging bandit model we adopt in this paper, each player i does not know the whole vector {a mathematical formula} ∇ i Φ (xt).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In order to follow the framework in Section 3, each player i needs to have a way to approximate the vector {a mathematical formula} ∇ i Φ (xt), her portion of the gradient vector {a mathematical formula} ∇ Φ (xt).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The proof of the theorem is based on the idea of Section 3.1 that if each player i can actually have her portion {a mathematical formula} ∇ i Φ (x Τ ) of the gradient vector {a mathematical formula} ∇ Φ (x Τ ) and do the update{a mathematical formula} then the collective update of all players can be seen as doing some generalized mirror descent on the convex function Φ .</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Now let us choose {a mathematical formula} Θ = Η Γ n Ε , and note that {a mathematical formula} Θ ≤ 1 by the assumption on Η .</a>
