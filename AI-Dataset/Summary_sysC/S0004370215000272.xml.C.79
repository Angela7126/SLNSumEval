<a href="#0" id="0">More precisely, if a formula of maximal {a mathematical formula}A,B-depth {a mathematical formula}k,j is true at all {a mathematical formula}(k,j)-models, then the formula is also true at all {a mathematical formula}(k ′ ,j ′ )-models, for {a mathematical formula}k ′ ≥ k and {a mathematical formula}j ′ ≥ j.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, Lakemeyer's approach is based on a {a mathematical formula}K45ncanonical model, which is a Kripke structure whose worlds are all maximally consistent (wrt the axioms of the modal logic {a mathematical formula}K45n) subsets of basic formulas (cf.Definition 20).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Now since epistemic notions are defined wrt the depth of formulas, the set of conceivable states of depth {a mathematical formula}k+1 is {a mathematical formula}Ek+1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">More precisely, let Σ be a satisfiable set of A-objective (not necessarily basic) formulas, of maximal B-depth k. Let Γ be any A-objective formula such that {a mathematical formula}| Γ |B ≤ k.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Suppose that we have defined a canonical model {a mathematical formula}Mc.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If{a mathematical formula} Φ 1, … , Φ lare{a mathematical formula}K45n-consistent basic i-objective formulas then there exists a basic i-objective formula Ψ of the form{a mathematical formula}Kj Ψ ′ for{a mathematical formula}j ≠ ithat is independent of{a mathematical formula} Φ 1, … , Φ lwrt{a mathematical formula}K45n.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Essentially, it is shown that if {a mathematical formula} Φ z, {a mathematical formula}z ≥ 1, are i-objective formulas of maximal j-depth k, then a formula Ψ of the form {a mathematical formula}(KjKi)k+1p for any proposition p is independent of {a mathematical formula} Φ z,z ≥ 1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It is sufficient to prove that every {a mathematical formula}AXn-consistent formula Α is satisfiable.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let Γ be a basic A-objective formula independent (wrt {a mathematical formula}K45n) of all formulas in {a mathematical formula} Γ A, which exists by way of Lemma 28.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Since the formulas in {a mathematical formula} Γ A are of maximal B-depth k, then note that such a Γ by way of the construction from Lemma 28 is of B-depth {a mathematical formula}2k+2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To illustrate that {a mathematical formula}AXnt is also complete for formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLnt, we will use ideas similar to that considered in Theorem 30.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Further, by the definition of {a mathematical formula}OLnt, {a mathematical formula} Φ iz, Ψ iz ∈ OLnt − 1.The remainder of the proof uses formal ideas similar to the ones used in Theorem 30, the only exception being that we do not restrict our attention to basic formulas.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Finally, a world {a mathematical formula}w ⁎ satisfies the consistent propositional formula Σ by definition.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">More precisely, we show that this proposal and our framework agree on provable formulas in {a mathematical formula}OLn.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Σ is propositional, {a mathematical formula}AXn ′ ⊢ S( Σ ) iff Σ is consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt (by the base case).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We now prove that {a mathematical formula}AXn ′ ⊢ S( Ζ ) iff Ζ is consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Essentially, as we have seen earlier in Theorem 37, consistency of Ζ holds iff {a mathematical formula} Φ 0 ∧ Φ z,z ≥ 1 and {a mathematical formula} Ψ 0 ∧ Ψ z ′ ,z ′ ≥ 1 are consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt while {a mathematical formula}¬ Φ 0 ∧ ¬ Ψ 0 is not {a mathematical formula}AXnt-consistent iff by induction (because {a mathematical formula} Φ i, Ψ i ∈ OLnt − 1): {a mathematical formula}AXn ′ ⊢ ⋀ S( Φ 0 ∧ Φ z), {a mathematical formula}AXn ′ ⊢ ⋀ S( Ψ 0 ∧ Ψ z ′ ) and {a mathematical formula}AXn ′ ⊢ V( Φ 0 ∨ Ψ 0), i.e.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">{a mathematical formula}AXn ′ ⊢ S( Ζ ) by V3.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">By symmetric arguments, we can show that {a mathematical formula}AXn ′ ⊢ S( Ξ ) iff Ξ is consistent wrt {a mathematical formula}AXnt.Continuing from above, we then have:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">The (basic) belief set of a k-structure {a mathematical formula}eAk is the set of formulas{a mathematical formula} The notion is analogous for a j-structure {a mathematical formula}eBj.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">The notion is analogous for a j-structure {a mathematical formula}eBj.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Suppose{a mathematical formula}eAkis any structure and{a mathematical formula}e+is the maximal structure corresponding to{a mathematical formula}eAk.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Then for any basic formula Α (of appropriate depth):{a mathematical formula}for any{a mathematical formula}eBjand w. (Analogously stated for epistemic states for B and their corresponding maximal structures.)</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">For formulas of the form {a mathematical formula}KB Α , the argument is trivial because we have the same epistemic state for B.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Suppose{a mathematical formula}eAkis any structure and{a mathematical formula}e+is the maximal structure corresponding to{a mathematical formula}eAk.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Let Γ be the belief set of{a mathematical formula}eAk.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">For every basic Α of maximal A-depth k:{a mathematical formula}An analogous result holds for B.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The notion of minimal knowledge from [2] is very similar in spirit to (propositional) {a mathematical formula}OL, especially when the two proposals are restricted to objective knowledge bases.</a>
