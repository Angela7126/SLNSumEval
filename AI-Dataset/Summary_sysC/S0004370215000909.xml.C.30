<a href="#0" id="0">1, {a mathematical formula}vkmax denotes the maximum fitness variance in the local neighborhood of all trial solutions in the current population for the kth objective with {a mathematical formula}k=[1,N].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Fitness variance in the local neighborhood: Once all trial solutions {a mathematical formula}X → j in the local neighborhood {a mathematical formula}Ni around {a mathematical formula}X → i have been identified, the fitness variance in {a mathematical formula}Ni is determined as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}nk,j symbolizes the sample size and {a mathematical formula}sk,j represents the spread of the samples of {a mathematical formula}fk(X → j) for {a mathematical formula}k=[1,N], which will be discussed very shortly.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Occurrence probability of the fitness samples: It is evident from the proposed nonuniform partitioning of the sample space that the fitness samples in the longer intervals are rare samples, probably owing to noise, and hence their contribution to the true fitness estimate of {a mathematical formula}X → i should not be regarded similarly to that of the fitness samples in the smaller interval.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We measure the contribution of the fitness samples of the interval j to the fitness estimate of the trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → i by a probability measure {a mathematical formula}pj:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}nk,ij represents the number of samples of {a mathematical formula}fk(X → i) in the jth interval for {a mathematical formula}j=[1,L].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The noisy version of the kth objective {a mathematical formula}fk(X → ), of any trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → , is given by{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Η k represents the injected stochastic noise amplitude that follows a certain probability distribution function (PDF).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The following five variants of {a mathematical formula} Η k are considered here:</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The uncertainty problem is resolved here by weighting the size of the objective space covered by a nondominated solution {a mathematical formula}X → with the probability that {a mathematical formula}X → dominates at least one population member.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The higher the probability, the more reliable the measure of the objective space covered by {a mathematical formula}X → .</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For a MOO problem with all objectives to be minimized, the probability of a trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → dominating another solution {a mathematical formula}X → j is given in (25):{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The mean and standard deviation of the ER metric for 50 independent runs (each with 300,000 FEs for a 30-dimensional problem) of each of the ten algorithms are presented in Table 7 with {a mathematical formula} Η k as exponential noise (mean 0.86 and variance 0.75).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Close scrutiny of Table 7 reveals that DENMO outperformed all nine evolutionary/swarm noisy MOO algorithms in a statistically significant fashion for 19 of the 23 test functions in achieving near optimal values of the ER metric.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The mean and standard deviation of the HVR metric for 50 independent runs (each with 300,000 FEs for a 30-dimensional problem) of each of the ten algorithms are presented in Table 8 with {a mathematical formula} Η k as Gaussian noise (mean 0 and variance 0.4).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Close inspection of Table 8 indicates that the performance of the proposed DENMO algorithm remained consistently superior to that of the other noisy MOO algorithms with respect to the HVR metric.</a>
