<a href="#0" id="0">We consider a simple model of cooperation among agents called Coalitional Skill Games (CSGs).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is a restricted form of coalitional games, where each agent has a set of skills that are required to complete various tasks.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each task requires a set of skills in order to be completed, and a coalition can accomplish the task only if the coalition ʼ s agents cover the set of required skills for the task.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The gain for a coalition depends only on the subset of tasks it can complete.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">CSGA CSG is the coalitional game Γ in a coalitional skill domain, where the players are the agents of the coalitional skill domain, and the characteristic function of a coalition is the value of the tasks that coalition can perform: {a mathematical formula}v Γ (C)=u(T(C)).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The most restricted form of CSGs is that of STSG — a Single Task Skill Game.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In an STSG, there is only one task t, whose set of required skills {a mathematical formula}S(t) are all the skills in the domain, so we have {a mathematical formula}S(t)=S.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In STSGs, the task value function is {a mathematical formula}u({t})=1, and {a mathematical formula}u( ∅ )=0.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A coalition C wins if it manages to cover all the skills, so {a mathematical formula}v Γ (C)=1 if and only if {a mathematical formula}S(t) ⊆ S(C), and since {a mathematical formula}S(t) is the set of all skills, we can simply say that a coalition wins if it covers all the skills in the domain, so {a mathematical formula}S(C)=S.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Let Γ be a WTSG, with tasks {a mathematical formula}t1, … ,tm.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula} Γ j be the STSG with the single task {a mathematical formula}tj, with the same agents and skills as Γ .</a>
