<a href="#0" id="0">Abstraction heuristic [12]Let Α be an abstraction with an associated abstract state space {a mathematical formula} Θ Α .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The induced abstraction heuristic{a mathematical formula}h Α (s) is a heuristic function that returns the cost of the cheapest path from {a mathematical formula} Α (s) to {a mathematical formula}S ⋆ Α in {a mathematical formula} Θ Α .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Abstraction heuristics are admissible and consistent, since {a mathematical formula} Θ Α is a homomorphism and, thus, paths in the original state space are preserved in the abstract state space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Every abstraction Α induces an equivalence relation on {a mathematical formula}S, {a mathematical formula} ∼ Α , defined as {a mathematical formula}s ∼ Α t if and only if {a mathematical formula} Α (s)= Α (t), i.e., any two states mapped to the same abstract state are considered to be equivalent by the abstract state space.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, each abstract state {a mathematical formula}si Α may be interpreted as a set of states {a mathematical formula}Si Α such that it contains every state mapped to {a mathematical formula}si Α , i.e., {a mathematical formula}Si Α ={s| Α (s)=si Α }.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, we will freely refer to an abstract state as an equivalence class or a set of states of the original state space.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">However, the value of {a mathematical formula}hUCSi does not increase monotonically with i, because during the initialization of a new abstract search {a mathematical formula}UCSi+1, new states may be introduced into the open list (those that are mapped by the abstraction to the same abstract state as any node in the open list) with a g-value lower than {a mathematical formula}r(UCSi)+mina ∈ A ⁡ c(a).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, adding the minimum action cost to the current radius is not admissible for those states anymore, since they are now considered equivalent to a state with lower cost to the goal.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">All the rest of SM&S abstractions in the hierarchy, {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i,0<i ≤ n, enable the desired trade-off between {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S 0 and {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S n. Each {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i is strictly more relaxed than the previous {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i − 1, so that the size of the abstract state spaces decreases at the expense of producing less informed heuristics {a mathematical formula}h Α SM&S i − 1(s) ≥ h Α SM&S i(s).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the original state space, sets of states are represented as functions {a mathematical formula}f:S → {1,0}, in terms of binary variables {a mathematical formula}x=x1, … ,xn.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the same way, sets of abstract states in {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i= Α i ⊗ Π Υ i+1, … , Υ n are represented as characteristic functions {a mathematical formula}f:S Α SM&S i → {1,0}.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">An important decision is what variables (and variable ordering) should be used to represent sets of abstract states in {a mathematical formula}S Α SM&S i.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Opposite examples can be defined where the number of BDD nodes required to represent {a mathematical formula} Α SM&S i(S) is exponentially larger than the number of nodes to describe S. However, the correspondence between the ADD that describes the M&S abstraction {a mathematical formula} Α 2 and the upper levels of any BDD describing a set of abstract states lets us prove some bounds on the size of BDDs describing any set of abstract states.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Proposition 4 bounds the size of a single layer of the BDD describing a set of abstract states in {a mathematical formula} Θ Α SM&S k. However, this result can easily be extended to all the upper layers in the BDD.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">As we are assuming a linear merge strategy, all the M&S abstractions are built as the merge of an M&S abstraction and the atomic abstraction of another variable.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Therefore, the bound of Proposition 4 is valid for all the upper levels of the BDD.</a>
