<a href="#0" id="0">Then for any conflict free {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ A, S is: admissible iff {a mathematical formula}S ⊆ F(A,C)(S); complete iff {a mathematical formula}S=F(A,C)(S) (i.e., S is a fixed point of {a mathematical formula}F(A,C)); grounded iff S is the least fixed point of {a mathematical formula}F(A,C); preferred iff S is a maximal fixed point of {a mathematical formula}F(A,C).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Arguments are defined with respect to a set or ‘ base ’ {a mathematical formula}B of classical formulae, which we assume does not contain ⋏ ; in the sequel ⋏ will be exclusively used to express that an inconsistency has been reached when constructing an argument.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A subset {a mathematical formula}A ′ of the arguments defined by {a mathematical formula}B are shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The premises (and conclusions) of arguments in each extension correspond to the maximal consistent subsets of {a mathematical formula}B (and their consequences).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, for each argument constructed, one must not only check consistency of the premises but also that they are subset-minimal; a problem in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy [30], so that in the worst case, for every constructed argument {a mathematical formula}( Δ , Α ) one needs to verify that {a mathematical formula} ∀ Δ ′ ⊂ Δ , {a mathematical formula} Δ ′ ⊬ c Α .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that a defeat by a falsum argument {a mathematical formula}X=( Δ , Γ , ⋏ ) on Y indicates that under the assumption that the premises Δ is true, the ‘ supposed premises ’ (i.e., suppositions) Γ in S are inconsistent, and Y in particular is targeted since at least one of the suppositions in Γ is also a premise of Y. AttacksLet {a mathematical formula}A be a set of dialectical arguments defined by {a mathematical formula}B.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Logically equivalent argumentsLet {a mathematical formula}A be the dialectical arguments defined by {a mathematical formula}B and ≺ a strict partial ordering over {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">DefeatsLet {a mathematical formula}A be a set of dialectical arguments, {a mathematical formula}C the attack relation, and ≺ a strict partial ordering, over {a mathematical formula}A.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">It suffices that the assumptions of arguments with conflicting conclusions (i.e., {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}F1) be combined to yield a falsum argument (i.e., {a mathematical formula}X1), which we argue is a less demanding, and indeed more intuitive assumption as to the arguments that an agent can construct.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Rather, given a constructed argument {a mathematical formula}( Δ , Γ , Α ), the practical meaning of P2 is that any differential labelling of the assumptions in {a mathematical formula} Δ ∪ Γ is accessible to an agent when using the argument dialectically.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let{a mathematical formula}E ⊆ Asuch that every argument in E is acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We show that every argument in {a mathematical formula}E ″ is acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula}E ″ .We first show that every argument in {a mathematical formula}E ′ is acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">{a mathematical formula}E ″ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Suppose for contradiction that {a mathematical formula}Y ∈ E ′ is not acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">{a mathematical formula}E ″ .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Then there exists a least fixed point of{a mathematical formula}F(A,D).Firstly, let E be a fixed point of {a mathematical formula}Fp.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Suppose we now add s to {a mathematical formula}B, and suppose the defined arguments in Fig.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Now, as will be shown in Section 4, one can define proof theories that do not generate R-contaminated arguments (such as {a mathematical formula}C ′ ).</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">We have therefore defined non-redundant {a mathematical formula}pdAFs that only need satisfy the property P4 ′ implied by P4, and as shown in the following section, need not assume redundance-coherent preference relations (given the absence of R-contaminated arguments) in order that the non-contamination postulates are satisfied.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Assumptions on preference relations in (non-redundant) {a mathematical formula}pdAFsIn the following results, when referring to {a mathematical formula}pdAFs in general, we will assume {a mathematical formula}pdAFs defined by preference relations that satisfy Pref1 (and hence the results can make use of Lemma 27) and are redundance-coherent.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">When referring to non-redundant {a mathematical formula}pdAFs, we assume only that the preference relations satisfy Pref1.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">(That there exists such an {a mathematical formula}E ′ with {a mathematical formula}E ′ ∖ E ≠ ∅ , can be seen by the limiting case in which {a mathematical formula}E ′ ∖ E is the set of unassailable arguments in {a mathematical formula}A ∖ A1; these are acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Hence:{a mathematical formula} We show {a mathematical formula}X ∈ E implies X acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">We now instantiate {a mathematical formula}pdAFs in which, in contrast with standard approaches to Cl-Arg[1], [33], [43], the proof theoretic means for constructing arguments is given.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">C-IntelimkLet {a mathematical formula} ⊢ k ⊆ 2L×L be defined as follows:</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">{a mathematical formula} Γ ⊢ k Φ if and only if there is a C-intelimk proof of Φ depending on some {a mathematical formula} Δ ⊆ Γ .</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">k-depth C-intelim argumentsLet {a mathematical formula}T be any normal C-intelimk proof of Φ depending on Σ (recall – Definition 30 – that Σ are the actual, and not virtual assumptions in {a mathematical formula}T), where {a mathematical formula} ∀ Α ∈ Σ , Α is annotated in {a mathematical formula}T by {an inline-figure} or {an inline-figure}, where {an inline-figure} stands for “ premise ” and {an inline-figure} stands for “ supposition ” .Then {a mathematical formula}( Δ , Γ , Φ ) is a C-intelimk argument, where {a mathematical formula} Δ ∪ Γ = Σ , {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Δ iff Α is annotated by {an inline-figure}, and {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Γ iff Α is annotated by {an inline-figure}.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">We concur in the sense that all arguments constructed must be included in a {a mathematical formula}pdAF, unless their exclusion does not change the semantics.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">It is worth noting at this point that the distinction between premises and suppositions in {a mathematical formula}( Δ ,{ Φ 1, … , Φ n}, Ψ ) cannot equivalently be made using the standard ontology, by an argument {a mathematical formula}( Δ , Φ 1, … , Φ n → Ψ ).</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">This paper also additionally: 1) formally proves the Fundamental Lemma and existence of a unique least fixed point of a {a mathematical formula}pdAF's characteristic function; 2) provides a comprehensive study of two types of contaminated arguments; 3) formally proves the non-interference and crash resistance postulates, generalised here to first order argumentation; 4) studies instantiation of {a mathematical formula}pdAFs by natural deduction proof theories that exclude R-contaminated arguments and accommodate agents that have bounds on their inferential capabilities.</a>
