<a href="#0" id="0">After analyzing both algorithms, we have observed that the underlying idea comes from the following observation: a MaxSAT formula {a mathematical formula} Φ n with n soft clauses and {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ n) ≥ e, {a mathematical formula}1 ≤ e ≤ n is MaxSAT reducible (Definition 5) to a formula {a mathematical formula} Φ n ′ + 〈 □ ,e 〉 with {a mathematical formula}n − e soft clauses and e empty clauses:{a mathematical formula}{a mathematical formula} Where {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ n ′ )=cost( Φ n) − cost( 〈 □ ,e 〉 ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As we will see, the Eva algorithm indirectly applies this idea by transforming the original instance through a sequence of applications of the MaxSAT resolution rule which guarantees the MaxSAT reducibility property.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is interesting to see that the incremental addition of 1-Cardinality constraints end up producing k-Cardinality constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, if we could identify a {a mathematical formula} Φ n whose optimal cost is greater than 1, we could directly write the {a mathematical formula}cost( Φ n)-Cardinality constraint and skip all the intermediate iterations performed by Eva and OLL.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, the only algorithm that has explicitly introduced a Cardinality constraint on the original soft clauses ({a mathematical formula}bi variables) is WPM3:{a mathematical formula}In the representation of the transformations, we can see how WPM3 builds explicitly a Cardinality constraint on the original soft clauses ({a mathematical formula}bi variables).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, it is the only one able to apply cover optimization efficiently, find out that {a mathematical formula} 〈 o22,1 〉 can also be replaced with {a mathematical formula} 〈 □ ,1 〉 , increase the lower bound by 2 and get the optimum before the third iteration.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If we add the cover optimization technique, see {a mathematical formula}wpm3o, then we get a version that would have ranked the first at MSE-2014 for industrial instances in terms of the total mean family ratio.</a>
