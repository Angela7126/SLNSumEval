<a href="#1" id="1">• The virtual player outperforms human players to correctly answer to questions of the game.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">the player is given a question but expressed as answer, and has to find the answer which must be expressed as a question.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Answer Scoring: leverages the list of text passages extracted from the Question Answering module and adopts several criteria to assign a score to each of the four possible answers to a question.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Decision Making: takes the final decision whether answering to a question or retiring from the game by considering the current level of the game, the available lifelines, and the score computed for each possible answer by the Answer Scoring.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It computes the Levenshtein distance between a candidate answer X and the title {a mathematical formula}ti of the Wikipedia page returned by the Question Answering module.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">It computes the Jaccard index between the set of terms in a candidate answer X and the set of terms in a passage of text {a mathematical formula}pi returned by the Question Answering module.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In our running example, the virtual player queries the Question Answering module using the following questions Who directed Blade Runner?</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The decision strategy evaluates the uncertainty of the information provided by the Question Answering module and the Answer Scoring, the available lifelines, and the level of the question in order to take the final decision.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This means that either the quality of the passages retrieved by the Question Answering module may be low, hence those passages are not useful to find the correct answer to the question, or the criteria adopted by the Answer Scoring for assigning a score to the candidate answers are not satisfactory;</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In a situation in which the virtual player has enough confidence in one of the candidate answers, it can answer the question without using any lifeline.</a>
