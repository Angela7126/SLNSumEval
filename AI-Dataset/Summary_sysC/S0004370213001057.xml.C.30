<a href="#0" id="0">The throughput of an activity i is defined as the average number of executions of i per time unit, and corresponds to the inverse of the average distance:{a mathematical formula} Analogously, the throughput of a set of activities is the inverse of Λ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A periodic schedule is pair {a mathematical formula} 〈 L, Λ 〉 where Λ is the iteration period and {a mathematical formula}L is a vector containing the start times for the execution 0 of all the activities, i.e.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">:{a mathematical formula} A periodic schedule obeys the following restriction:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that changes in the modulus affect not only the resource usage but also the modular end time {a mathematical formula}ei.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In general, in [28] we showed that the amount of resource k required by activity i in a time window having width Λ is given by the following expression:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As an alternative, it is possible to use traditional resource constraints by making the assumption that {a mathematical formula} Β i= Η i, i.e.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">that the end and the start time of an execution {a mathematical formula}(i, Ω ) must be within to the same period.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Formally:{a mathematical formula} Since no activity is scheduled across different periods, the classical cumulative constraint can be used.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Traditional cumulative constraint With the assumption that the activities are scheduled within the period (i.e.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula}ei< Λ ), as in the {a mathematical formula}CROSS ⁎ approach, the algorithm proposed achieves the same filtering of a traditional cumulative constraint, i.e.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The former corresponds to the maximum Λ value (i.e.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">{a mathematical formula} Λ ¯) and the latter corresponds to the minimum Λ value (i.e.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">{a mathematical formula} Λ ̲ ).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Note that with {a mathematical formula} Λ ̲ the activities A and B now cross the modulus, increasing the resource consumption at time 0.</a>
