<a href="#0" id="0">Given an explicit account of the observations made by each agent, the required semantics of the K relation are clear: {a mathematical formula}K(agt,s ′ ,s) must hold whenever {a mathematical formula}s ′ is legal, both s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ would result in the same view for the agent, and s and {a mathematical formula}s ′ are rooted at K-related initial situations:{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These axioms suffice to ensure that knowledge behaves as we require: two situations will be related by {a mathematical formula}K(agt,s ′ ,s) if and only if they result in identical views for that agent, {a mathematical formula}s ′ is legal, and their root situations were initially related:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the {a mathematical formula}do(c,s) case, we proceed by expanding the definition for Knows using our new successor state axiom for K, collecting sub-formulae that match the form of the Knows macro, and using regression and the persistence condition to render the resulting expressions uniform in s. In the base case, we apply the persistence condition to an expansion of Knows at {a mathematical formula}S0 to produce the desired result.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our previous work on the persistence condition meta-operator [19] discussed the advantages of this approach in detail, but its primary advantage is to make automated reasoning approachable at all – the alternative is second-order theorem proving against the full theory {a mathematical formula}D.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The proof proceeds by cases on situation s and its mechanics mirror the analogous Theorem 7 in [45], but with the addition of a persistence condition application.For notational clarity we define the abbreviation {a mathematical formula}PEO(agt, Φ ,o,s) (for “ persists under equivalent observations ” ) which states that Φ holds in all legal futures of s compatible with observations o:{a mathematical formula}First, note that we need only consider two cases: {a mathematical formula}do(c,s) and {a mathematical formula}S0.</a>
