<a href="#1" id="1">Given a CNF formula Φ , what is the complexity of deciding whether there exists an empowering implicate for Φ ?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given a CNF formula Φ and a clause C we define IsImplicate({a mathematical formula} Φ ,C) as the problem of deciding whether C is an implicate of Φ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is well known that this problem is co-NP complete (co-SAT is a special case of IsImplicate({a mathematical formula} Φ ,C) in which C is an empty clause).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A clause C is called 1-provable with respect to a CNF formula Φ , if {a mathematical formula} Φ ∧ ¬C ⊢ 1 ⊥ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A clause C is thus 1-provable if it is an implicate of C and the fact that C is an implicate can be proved using unit propagation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">A CNF decomposition of a propagation algorithm (propagator) {a mathematical formula}fP is a formula in CNF {a mathematical formula} Φ P over variables {a mathematical formula}x ∪ y such that</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let Φ be a CNF formula and let{a mathematical formula}C=l1 ∨ ⋯ ∨ lkbe an implicate of Φ which is not empowering.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let A be a clause and let{a mathematical formula}li ∈ Cbe an arbitrary literal.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then{a mathematical formula}C ∨ Ais not empowering implicate of Φ with empowered literal{a mathematical formula}li.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let Φ be a nonempty satisfiable CNF formula (i.e.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">it has at least one nonempty clause) and let C be an empowering implicate for Φ .</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Then any implicate{a mathematical formula}C ′ of Φ subsuming C is empowering for Φ (this in particular includes the case when{a mathematical formula}C ′ is prime).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let Φ be a CNF formula and let C be produced from Φ by a series of non-merge resolutions.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Then C is not an empowering implicate of Φ .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">If Φ is a prime quadratic CNF formula, then it is propagation complete.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">If Φ is not satisfiable, then the proposition of the theorem is trivial.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Let us assume that Φ is a satisfiable prime quadratic CNF formula.By Lemma 3.2 it is enough to consider prime implicates as candidates for empowering implicates.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">Because Φ is a prime CNF formula, it must contain all the unit prime implicates.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Hence, if any other prime implicate should be added to Φ to make it propagation complete, it must be a quadratic clause which is produced by resolving two other quadratic clauses.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Let C be an implicate of a CNF formula Φ which is produced from Φ by a resolution proof D in which the last resolution made is a merge resolution.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Assume that C is an empowering implicate of a formula Φ which is not 1-provable.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Then there is an implicate{a mathematical formula}C ′ of Φ such that{a mathematical formula}C ⊂ C ′ and C is both 1-provable and empowering.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Let Φ be a formula on n variables which is not propagation complete and s be the size of the CNF representation of Φ (i.e.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">s is the total number of occurrences of literals in Φ ).</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">Then there is an empowering implicate C of Φ which can be derived by a series of resolutions of length at most s from Φ .</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Let Φ be a CNF formula and let x be a new variable not appearing in Φ .</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Then{a mathematical formula} Φ ⊨ ⊥ if and only if{a mathematical formula} Φ ⊢ 1 ⊥ or x is the only prime empowering implicate of{a mathematical formula}( Φ ∨ x).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">Moreover, if{a mathematical formula} Φ ⊬ 1 ⊥ , then there is a one-to-one correspondence between the resolution refutations of Φ and resolution derivations of x from{a mathematical formula}( Φ ∨ x).</a>
