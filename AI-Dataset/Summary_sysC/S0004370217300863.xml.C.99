<a href="#0" id="0">Regarding the reduction in the proof of Proposition 16, note that a maximal model of {a mathematical formula}F is given by {a mathematical formula}X ∖ M, with {a mathematical formula}M a minimal set over the predicate (15).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">{a mathematical formula}J ⊨ (R ∖ M).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By Definition 2, since {a mathematical formula}M is minimal for P, then for any {a mathematical formula}M ′ ⊊ M the predicate does not hold, that is, {a mathematical formula}J ⊭ (R ∖ M ′ ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Regarding the reduction in the proof of Proposition 22, note that the maximal entailed subset of {a mathematical formula}N given {a mathematical formula}J is given by {a mathematical formula}N ∖ M, being {a mathematical formula}M a minimal set over the predicate (21).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Regarding the reduction in the proof of Proposition 26, note that the set of independent variables of {a mathematical formula}F is given by {a mathematical formula}X ∖ M, being {a mathematical formula}M a minimal set over the predicate (28).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The definitions of the reduction in the proof of Proposition 30 apply.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As a result, the predicate is defined as follows:{a mathematical formula}Monotonicity.</a>
