<a href="#0" id="0">Because of the good performance of HypE and encouraged by a preliminary study [36], we hypothesize that using such an approximation instead of the exact contributing hypervolume will make the aforementioned MOEAs applicable to problems with many objectives and that the resulting algorithms will push the boundaries of MOEAs for many-objective optimization.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The contribution {a mathematical formula}CON(a,A) is an important measure since instead of using the hypervolume directly, most hypervolume-based algorithms such as the steady-state MO-CMA-ES or the SMS-EMOA remove, in the selection step, the individual{a mathematical formula} contributing the least hypervolume to the population A.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This Monte Carlo algorithm returns, for a population A and arbitrary small {a mathematical formula} Ε , Δ >0, an individual {a mathematical formula}a1 ˜ with the property{a mathematical formula} The algorithm samples in the minimal bounding boxes of all contributions and conducts a race between the different candidates until an individual {a mathematical formula}a1 ˜ is found which (with high probability) has a contribution very close to the hypervolume contribution of {a mathematical formula}a1.</a>
