<a href="#0" id="0">The downside to such a strategy is that often only a single cut is added at each separation round whereas it may be more efficient to find several cuts at once.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We therefore outline a different method of identifying cuts to add, based on directly identifying any cycles in the graph encoded by the current relaxed solution and then adding cluster cuts ruling each of them out.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As the relaxed solution, by definition, has the integrality constraint on variable values relaxed, it may contain variables which have fractional values.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition, searching for 4 node convex hull cuts which separate a relaxed solution is itself quite time consuming.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As it is difficult to deduce whether these constraints should be added initially, as cutting planes, or not at all, we present experimental results in Section 5.3 assessing the best way to make use of them.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Specifically, a point is chosen which lies somewhere on a line between the best known heuristic solution to the problem and the current solution to the relaxed problem, and the usual cutting plane finding methods are called to separate this point.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let the best known heuristic solution be {a mathematical formula}Sh and the current relaxed solution be {a mathematical formula}Sr, then the point to be separated by the cutting plane routine is {a mathematical formula} Α Sh+(1 − Α )Sr where the parameter {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ [0,1] determines how close to the currently known heuristic solution the point to be separated is.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As such, the point to separate is a convex combination of the current heuristic solution and the current relaxed solution.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The presented methods will always find an optimum BN given sufficient time and computational resources.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It therefore makes little sense to evaluate the score of the network found or the similarity of this network to the true one as this is simply evaluating how well optimisation of the score works; the same results would be found for all variants of the ILP technique, as well as for any other exact optimising technique such as [11] or [12].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Rather, the correct form of evaluation here is to analyse the time needed to find an optimum BN.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As the NP-hardness of the problem requires a limit on the size of the parent sets considered, our algorithm may not find the true most likely BN, as it may have larger parent sets than we permit.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Any experiments which had not terminated in this time limit have the gap between their best relaxed LP solution and their best known heuristic solution shown in the following tables, which provides a proxy for how much more work the search has remaining to do at that point.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">As our intention is to evaluate various possible aspects of the ILP BN learning problem, we do not compare the algorithm to other approaches.</a>
