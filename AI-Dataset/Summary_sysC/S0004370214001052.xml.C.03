<a href="#2" id="2">In a game of imperfect information, players do not observe the current state but observe the information set that contains it.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An Information Capture And ReUse Strategy (ICARUS) is an enhancement to MCTS that collects information from visits to one area of the game tree and uses that information to inform the future policy in other areas.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The ICARUS defines three functions: the policy function specifying how the information is used during each MCTS playout, the capture function specifying which records are to be updated in response to the playout, and the backpropagation function specifying how each record's information is updated.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">{a mathematical formula} Θ initial:R → Θ is the initial information function, which maps each record to a piece of information.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Algorithm 1 shows an MCTS algorithm using ICARUS to choose the best action from an information set {a mathematical formula}Iroot.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Each step of the playout uses the policy function Α to choose an action a, depending on the current move history {a mathematical formula}[h] ⌣ Ρ (s) for the player about to act from state s, the current information mapping Θ , and the set of available actions {a mathematical formula}A(s) (line 11).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this case the information set {a mathematical formula}Iroot is a singleton {a mathematical formula}{sroot} and line 8 can be omitted.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">{a mathematical formula} Θ nbase([h] ⌣ ) denotes the number of visits to history {a mathematical formula}[h] ⌣ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A history h with an available action set {a mathematical formula}As is said to be</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">a simulation node if {a mathematical formula} Θ nbase([h] ⌣ )=0.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Backpropagation updates the records associated with the actions played during the playout (MAST-6), with the player who played each action as contextual information (MAST-5).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In the ICARUS framework, the values learned offline can be encoded in the initial information function {a mathematical formula} Θ initial, and the online learning by embedding {a mathematical formula}TD( Λ ) in the backpropagation function Ω .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The information associated with a record is the last good action played in reply to that move by that player, or {a mathematical formula} ⊥ ∉ A if no reply has yet been recorded (LGR-2, LGR-3).</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The policy examines the most recent move {a mathematical formula}[at] ⌣ Ρ t from the point of view of the player about to act {a mathematical formula} Ρ t.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Backpropagation updates the records associated with each sequence of n moves in the playout (NAST-6), with the player who played the last move in the sequence as contextual information (NAST-5).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In [50] we show that NAST works for the three imperfect information games studied in the present paper (Section 7), with {a mathematical formula}n=2 typically giving the strongest performance.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">In the ICARUS framework this can be achieved by encoding the heuristic in the initial information function {a mathematical formula} Θ initial and modifying the policy function Α appropriately.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">For two ICARUSes {a mathematical formula}I1 and {a mathematical formula}I2 as above, and a function {a mathematical formula} Λ : Θ base → [0,1] (the mixing coefficient, which is a function of the information for the baseline ICARUS as defined in Specification 1), the combination {a mathematical formula} Λ I1+(1 − Λ )I2 is defined as in Specification 6 with the exception of the policy function:{a mathematical formula} We can generalise this to define any convex combination of two or more enhancements in the natural way.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">This is valid only for ICARUSes where the policy function has the form{a mathematical formula} for some function {a mathematical formula}v:A → R.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">the value of n, for which {a mathematical formula} Λ RAVE=0.5).</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">In this section we introduce EPisodic Information Capture and reuse (EPIC), an enhancement designed within the ICARUS framework.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Set {a mathematical formula}E={L1,L2,L3} and{a mathematical formula} Here an episode is a stream from one leading play to the next.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">To define the episode function for EPIC, we set {a mathematical formula}E={D,L1,L2,L3,L4} and{a mathematical formula} The first episode in a game of Hearts encompasses the dealing and card passing stages; subsequent episodes are single tricks.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">For EPIC's episode function, we set {a mathematical formula}E={M1,M2} and{a mathematical formula} An episode begins when a player moves a piece.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Othello, or Reversi, is a two-player game with perfect information, played on an {a mathematical formula}8×8 board.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">The EPIC episode function is defined by {a mathematical formula}E={M1,M2} and{a mathematical formula} An episode begins on the turn after a player places a new piece on one of the 28 squares around the edge of the board.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">For a Κ -player game, we play one instance of the ICARUS combination in question against {a mathematical formula} Κ − 1 instances of the baseline player (unenhanced MO-ISMCTS).</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Both enhancements use UCB1 as a simulation policy, the difference being the context in which the multi-armed bandit statistics are collected: for EPIC the context is game-specific, whereas for {a mathematical formula}n=2 NAST the context is the previous move in the game (similar to LGRF).</a>
