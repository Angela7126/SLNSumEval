<a href="#0" id="0">Initially the teacher also has the meaning transducer for the target language, which it uses both to produce utterances appropriate to the given situation, and to analyze the utterances of the learner.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Initially the learner has no language-specific knowledge, just the predicates and categories, which are common to all the target languages.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The interactions of the learner and teacher are described in detail in the next section.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The teacher analyzes the learner's utterance (if any) in the context of the situation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The learner's utterance may be correct, have an error in form or an error in meaning, or be uninterpretable.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If the learner's utterance has an error in form or an error in meaning, the teacher decides randomly (using the correction probability) whether to correct the learner.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The teacher produces a random utterance appropriate to the situation: either a correction of the learner's utterance or a randomly drawn denoting utterance.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The learner analyzes the teacher's utterance and updates its current grammar for the language as appropriate.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given a situation and an utterance by the teacher, the learner uses the transitively reduced implication graph {a mathematical formula}Hr in an attempt to determine the meaning of the teacher's utterance as follows.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For each successive word of the teacher's utterance, the learner finds the list of all predicate symbols such that there is an edge from the word to the predicate symbol in {a mathematical formula}Hr.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Some of the predicate symbols may then be removed from each word's list as follows.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, early in one run of learning with {a mathematical formula}M1, the learner translated the teacher's utterance el cuadrado rojo into the following sequence of lists of predicate symbols:{a mathematical formula} In the reduced implication graph at that point, no predicate symbols were associated with the word el, the two predicate symbols gr1 and sq1 were associated with the word cuadrado and the predicate symbol re1 was associated with the word rojo.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Evidently the data at that point were not sufficient to rule out the predicate symbol gr1 as a possible meaning for cuadrado.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The process used by the teacher to analyze the learner's utterance is as follows.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">If the learner's utterance is equal to one of the correct denoting utterances for the situation, the teacher classifies the learner's utterance as correct.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">If the learner's utterance is not correct, the teacher “ translates ” the learner's utterance into a sequence of predicates by using the adult meaning transducer for the language.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">If the resulting sequence of predicates is the same as the sequence of predicates in at least one meaning obtained from a correct denoting utterance, the learner's utterance is classified as having an error in form.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">In this case, the learner is judged to have chosen a correct meaning but an incorrect form to express that meaning.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The goal of the teacher is to choose a possible correction with the same meaning as that intended by the learner.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">A possible correction is chosen by the teacher by considering the set of denoting utterances whose meanings have the same sequence of predicates and choosing one such utterance using a measure of similarity to the learner's utterance.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">For example, if {a mathematical formula}(el1,sm1) corresponds to a denoting utterance for the situation, the teacher may choose la elipse pequena as a possible correction for el elipse pequeno.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">If the learner's utterance is not correct and its corresponding sequence of predicates is not equal to the sequence of predicates for any denoting utterance for the situation, the teacher uses a measure of similarity between the sequence of predicates for the learner's utterance and the sequences of predicates corresponding to denoting utterances for the situation to determine whether there is a “ close enough ” match between the predicate sequences, determined by a threshold on a weighted edit distance on the sequences.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">If the learner produces an utterance but none of these cases (correct, error in form, error in meaning) apply, then the teacher classifies the learner's utterance as uninterpretable and does not offer a correction.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Because the learner has no knowledge of the language, it does not attempt an utterance.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">The teacher's classification is “ no utterance ” and it does not attempt a correction, but rather produces a randomly-drawn denoting utterance for the situation, which in English would be the purple ellipse to the left of the triangle.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">The learner is not able to understand the utterance, does not acquire a new general form, and does not perceive any correction by the teacher.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Here is the first interaction in which the learner perceives a correction by the teacher, because the meaning intended by the learner and the learner's understanding of the teacher's utterance are the same, but the actual utterances are different (the learner's utterance has an incorrect choice for the article for the word triangle).</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Note that although the learner perceives a correction, the teacher's utterance is processed the same way as it would be if the learner did not perceive a correction.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The final interaction in the sequence of 50 is followed by the teacher's summary of its classifications and corrections.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">In this particular run, the teacher's classifications were: 12 correct utterances, 10 utterances with an error in meaning, 9 utterances with an error in form, 10 uninterpretable utterances, and 9 interactions in which the learner produced no utterance.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">Because the teacher's correction probability was 1.0, it offered a correction for every error in meaning or form, for a total of 19 corrections.</a>
