<a href="#0" id="0">It is at this stage of the social action that social power and influence are essential.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">According to Castelfranchi [15], the power of the delegating agent to influence the delegated agent arises based on the social power of the former over the latter.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on this definition, social power is identified in situations in which one agent depends on an individual power of another and both agents are aware of this dependence relation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From a social power perspective, influence is the exercise of power.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The dynamics of these social relations can be related to different bases of power and are operationalized in group interactions between the virtual agents and the player.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">that support the way in which social power is conceptualized.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Research related to social power from a social influence perspective is more closely related to agent applications employing social power.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">[7] and even the mechanism of social power transfer as presented by Hayes et al.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Social power is conceptualized based on its effects.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">However, we wish to model social power and its effects based on atomic factors and to simulate social power interactions based on those factors.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This framework provides invaluable insight for the modeling and operationalization of social power interactions in an agent architecture.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The simplest situation is one in which the actor merely exists in the context of the target and the target must consider the social power relations between the two before performing an action.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">This is a case in which social power is invoked implicitly.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">In the first type of interaction, the actor might not even be aware of the specific social power situation.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">In a given social power interaction, the agent may identify several social powers to be simultaneously active.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Once all bases of social power have been introduced, we also present a situation in which most types of social powers are present.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">By contrast, the rewarding tendency factor evolves based on the target's experience with the actor agent in accordance with the social power dynamics.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">A coercive social power is therefore inversely proportional to the value of the coercive action and directly proportional to the target's perception of the coercive tendency of the actor for that coercive action.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">By contrast, the coercive tendency factor evolves based on the target's experience with the actor agent in accordance with the social power dynamics.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">As in the case of a reward social power, a negative coercive social power is also possible if there is a mismatch between the motivations that the actor agent believes the target to have and his real motivations.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">When a social power is based on such a norm, as modeled by Formula (11), the corresponding bias is also proportionally affected by the degree of dependence {a mathematical formula}DependenceA,T,C{sup:16} of the actor agent on the target.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">A referent liking social power is therefore directly proportional to the strength of the liking relation held by the target agent and to its affiliative motivation.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">When an agent has a motivation to influence another (e.g., needs another to perform some action), he/she evaluates the bases of social power that are relevant for influencing that other agent.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">{sup:18} If the agent decides to use a social power strategy, he/she assesses which strategies he/she can employ given the available bases of social power.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">When refraining from using a social power strategy the communication of the influence does not in any way emphasize any social power.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">If no influence interaction is anticipated but one occurs nonetheless, then the agent begins by assessing the bases of social power identified as relevant to that interaction.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">The first step is the assessment of the relevant social power bases for the interaction.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">7, highlights the relations of the typical agent processes with three core social power processes that are identified as fundamental for agents participating in social power interaction episodes.</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">The “ Power Strategies ” attribute represents the agent's known strategies for using various bases of social power.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">The third motivation dimension is power and is related to the need for status and recognition; therefore, this dimension is used to model the personal status motivation of the agent relevant to referent status social powers.</a>
<a href="#30" id="30">To create an agent that is capable of sensing, deliberating and taking action based on social power, we must understand how social power is manipulated.</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">If the claim is rejected, this means that the target confers less social power than the actor expected.</a>
<a href="#32" id="32">This reasoning can be applied to several of the social power bases introduced by French and Raven.</a>
<a href="#33" id="33">Following the same approach, we created social power strategies for all factors used in the formalization of the different bases of social power.</a>
<a href="#34" id="34">Power Bases measured the user's social power over the agent for each of the considered social power bases.</a>
