<a href="#0" id="0">In Sokoban a state is defined by the positions of the k stones and by the reachable component of the man, i.e., the set of free squares reachable by the man without pushing stones.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We can construct a PDB which stores the shortest distance to the nearest abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Since in Sokoban the goal state is defined implicitly, every placement of the {a mathematical formula}k ′ stones on the k goal squares is an abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The heuristic value of a state is the sum of the heuristic value for the maze zone, obtained by the IPDB, a heuristic value for the goal zone, and global linear conflicts between stones adjacent to the cut square and a stone at the cut square.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For the goal zone we use a heuristic function similar to the standard heuristic function EMM of Sokoban.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Global and local linear conflictsFor a given instance decomposition into a maze and a goal zone, a linear conflict of two stones in state {a mathematical formula}u ∈ S is called global, if one of the stones is placed at the cut square.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the MPDB, we have the distance from each abstract state to its closest abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We can partition k stones into disjoint parts of size {a mathematical formula}k ′ , and each part represents an abstract state if we add the reachable component of the man.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this case, we can sum up the distance of each abstract state and get an admissible heuristic value.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Note that several abstract states could be mapped to the same abstract goal state.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Table 7 shows the number of explored nodes and the solving time for all instances that could be solved by at least one of the solvers ({a mathematical formula}RS ⁎ , EMM, MPDB, IPDB).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">MPDB and IPDB were tested with abstractions of two and four stones.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The test was limited to abstractions of at most four stones, since for some instances a PDB with five stones could not be built in an hour.</a>
