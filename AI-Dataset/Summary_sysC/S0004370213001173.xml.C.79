<a href="#0" id="0">Our proposed focus concerns automated planning integrated with these other reasoning tools: a focus that enriches the field with a number of research challenges and allows it to address significantly more relevant problems for real-world applications.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Both the refinement and adaptation mechanisms can be designed through an approach based on our vision, where the HOM facility is an actor that can be organized into a hierarchy of reasoning functions, where each abstract action can be a task to be further refined and planned for, and where online planning and acting are performed continually in order to adapt and repair plans.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We need to provide refinement mechanisms that can be triggered at run-time whenever an abstract action in a procedure needs to be refined or an adaptation needs to be taken into account, in agreement with our idea that the actor (integrating planning and acting) should be the primary topic of investigation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Making the right predictions from the combined models of actions and skills, as well as from additional models of the environment, is a difficult problem that involves heterogeneous representations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, autonomous acting requires extended perception capabilities: sensing actions as well as querying and information gathering steps, combined into a consistent interpretation of the environment.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">They include in particular AI problems such as anchoring and symbol grounding (i.e., establish, maintain and revise signals-to-symbols relations), reasoning on what is observable and what is not, integrating knowledge-gathering actions to environment changing actions, acting in order to maintain a consistent interpretation of self and the world, dynamic situation and plan-recognition problems.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The traditional approach in automated planning is to integrate the relevant part of the environmental model, viewed at an abstract relational level, within the planning problem specifications.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, in practical hierarchical systems, the lower levels generally require different state and action spaces, in order to reason with the appropriate representations about details that would be both irrelevant and problematic at the higher, more abstract levels.</a>
