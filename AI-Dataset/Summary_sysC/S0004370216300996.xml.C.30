<a href="#0" id="0">Problem 5Generating a solution to a GIC constraint network cannot be done in polynomial time, unless{a mathematical formula}P=NP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To restore GIC, Function restoreAfterDeleting(), presented in Algorithm 9, must be called.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When this function is called for, it is for a GIC-staged configuration trace {a mathematical formula}T= 〈 N1, … ,Np 〉 on a CN N from a sequence of decisions {a mathematical formula} Δ = 〈 Δ 1, … , Δ p 〉 .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In lines 1 – 3, GAC is maintained after each decision taken in sequence from {a mathematical formula} Δ replay.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, in lines 4 – 7, we process each level in sequence from bottom to top.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If {a mathematical formula}(x,a) has been deleted (at level {a mathematical formula}j − 1) by GAC after decision {a mathematical formula} Δ j, we know that GIC will prune {a mathematical formula}(x,a) at level {a mathematical formula}j − 1 at the very last.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Hence, we update the interval of {a mathematical formula}(x,a) accordingly.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">After having processed all values of a level, we have to call the backtrack function to restore domains in the state they were before applying GAC (line 8).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The interval of {a mathematical formula}(x,a) in Unk is modified in line 7 only if GAC has removed {a mathematical formula}(x,a) after decision {a mathematical formula} Δ j has been applied.</a>
