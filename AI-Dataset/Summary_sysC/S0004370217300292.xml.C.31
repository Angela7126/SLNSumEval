<a href="#0" id="0">Proof</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consider a price competition game with one buyer type.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We use the simplified notation {a mathematical formula}vj to denote the valuation of the buyers for vendor j.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Let {a mathematical formula}j ⁎ ∈ arg ⁡ maxj ∈ M ⁡ {vj − cj} and {a mathematical formula}j ′ ∈ arg ⁡ maxj ∈ M ∖ j ⁎ ⁡ {vj − cj} be two vendors with the highest values for the difference {a mathematical formula}vj − cj.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Set {a mathematical formula}pj ⁎ =vj ⁎ − vj ′ +cj ′ and {a mathematical formula}pj=cj for any vendor {a mathematical formula}j ≠ j ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We claim that this price vector together with the consistent assignment x that assigns the buyers to vendor {a mathematical formula}j ⁎ is an equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Indeed, no vendor {a mathematical formula}j ≠ j ⁎ has any incentive to change its price; a decrease would result in negative utility while an increase would not change the assignment.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Moreover, vendor {a mathematical formula}j ⁎ has no incentive to change its price; a decrease can only lower its utility while an increase would result in a new assignment in which all buyers are attracted by vendor {a mathematical formula}j ′ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Proof</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">PriceCompetitionis solvable in polynomial time when the number of buyer types is constant.We begin by arguing that it suffices to consider non-fractional assignments, i.e., assignments where all buyers of the same type are assigned to a single vendor.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To see that, consider an equilibrium {a mathematical formula}(x,p) where buyers of some type i are split between two vendors j and {a mathematical formula}j ′ .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Then, it must be {a mathematical formula}pj=cj and {a mathematical formula}pj ′ =cj ′ , and the assignment in which all these buyers are assigned to vendor j without changing the prices is still an equilibrium.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Indeed, at equilibrium the utilities of buyers of type i assigned to j and {a mathematical formula}j ′ should be the same.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence, if one of the two vendors had a price strictly higher than its production cost, it could increase its utility by negligibly decreasing its price; this would result in attracting all buyers of type i previously assigned to j and {a mathematical formula}j ′ .</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Proof</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We first prove the upper bound.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Consider an optimal assignment x with {a mathematical formula}xij ∈ {0, Μ i} for every buyer type/vendor pair and the price vector p with {a mathematical formula}pj=cj; clearly, x is consistent to p. By deviating to any other price, vendor j cannot get any buyers that are not assigned to it in the optimal assignment; it can, however, increase its utility by raising the price for those buyers that are already assigned to it.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Hence, it suffices to assign a subsidy of {a mathematical formula}sj(x,p)= ∑ ixij(vij − cj) to each vendor j; this obviously yields a total amount of subsidies equal to {a mathematical formula}SW ⁎ that enforces the optimal assignment as an equilibrium, since each vendor obtains the maximum utility from its assigned buyers.For the lower bound, let {a mathematical formula} Χ >2 and consider the price competition game with two buyer types of unit volume and valuations Χ and 1 for a single vendor of production cost of 0.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The optimal social welfare is {a mathematical formula}SW ⁎ = Χ +1.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">Observe that the utility of the vendor is maximized to Χ by setting its price to Χ while any price that is consistent to assigning both buyer types to the vendor is at most 1 for a vendor utility of at most 2.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Hence, the amount of subsidies required to enforce the optimal assignment as an equilibrium is at least {a mathematical formula} Χ − 2 which becomes at least {a mathematical formula}(1 − Ε )SW ⁎ by setting Χ sufficiently large.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Example 3</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Consider the price competition game in the proof of Lemma 4; we repeat it in Table 4.Consider the allocation x where all buyers of type ℓ are assigned to vendor ℓ and all buyers of type r are assigned to vendor r. By applying algorithm CandidatePrice, we obtain the price vector {a mathematical formula}p=(5,5) and the corresponding subsidy vector {a mathematical formula}s(x,p)=(1,1); this amount of subsidies is required so that no vendor has incentive to lower the price to {a mathematical formula}3 − Ε and obtain all buyers and a utility of {a mathematical formula}6 − 2 Ε .</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">One can observe that the price vector {a mathematical formula}p ′ =(4.5,4.5) and the corresponding subsidy vector {a mathematical formula}s ′ (x,p ′ )=(0.5,0.5) enforces the optimal assignment as an equilibrium using half the amount of subsidies.</a>
