<a href="#0" id="0">Let {a mathematical formula}DL be any classical description logic language and let {a mathematical formula}DLN be the extension of {a mathematical formula}DL with a new concept name {a mathematical formula}NC for each {a mathematical formula}DL concept C. The new concepts are called normality concepts and denote the standard instances of C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A canonical{a mathematical formula}DLNknowledge base (hereafter knowledge base, for simplicity) is a disjoint union {a mathematical formula}KB=S ∪ D where {a mathematical formula}S is a finite set of {a mathematical formula}DL inclusions and assertions (called strong or classical axioms) and {a mathematical formula}D is a finite set of defeasible inclusions (DIs, for short) that are expressions {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ nD where C is a {a mathematical formula}DL concept and D a {a mathematical formula}DLN concept.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">{sup:3} If {a mathematical formula} Δ =(C ⊑ nD), then {a mathematical formula}pre( Δ ) and {a mathematical formula}con( Δ ) denote C and D, respectively.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, for all DIs {a mathematical formula} Δ ∈ D and all {a mathematical formula}NC ∈ Σ , let:{a mathematical formula} The informal meaning of {a mathematical formula} Δ NC is: “ {a mathematical formula}NC's instances satisfy Δ ” .</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">According to the above discussion, we shall use the metalevel version reported in Table 1 as the analysis tool to study {an inline-figure}, i.e.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">the consequence relation of {a mathematical formula}DLN, and compare it with those of Default, Autoepistemic, and Circumscribed DLs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This metalevel analysis will be refined and extended by using two internalized versions of the KLM postulates in order to clarify the meaning of {a mathematical formula}DLN expressions such as {a mathematical formula}C ⊑ nD and {a mathematical formula}NC ⊑ D, that syntactically resemble the internalized conditionals {a mathematical formula} Ω {an inline-figure} Φ but actually have different semantics.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The internalized postulates help also in comparing {a mathematical formula}DLN with Lehmann's default logic and with the description logics illustrated in the following section.</a>
