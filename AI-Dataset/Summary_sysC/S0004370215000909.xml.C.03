<a href="#0" id="0">Let us consider two trial solutions {a mathematical formula}X → i and {a mathematical formula}X → j of a MOO problem where all N objectives need to be minimized.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In a MOO, a trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → ⁎ is said to be nondominated if there is no {a mathematical formula}X → that dominates {a mathematical formula}X → ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The crowding distance of a trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → in a nondominated set depicts the perimeter of a hypercube formed by its nearest neighbors — that is, {a mathematical formula}X → i and {a mathematical formula}X → j — at the vertices in the fitness landscapes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">1, {a mathematical formula}vkmax denotes the maximum fitness variance in the local neighborhood of all trial solutions in the current population for the kth objective with {a mathematical formula}k=[1,N].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Fitness variance in the local neighborhood: Once all trial solutions {a mathematical formula}X → j in the local neighborhood {a mathematical formula}Ni around {a mathematical formula}X → i have been identified, the fitness variance in {a mathematical formula}Ni is determined as follows:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}nk,j symbolizes the sample size and {a mathematical formula}sk,j represents the spread of the samples of {a mathematical formula}fk(X → j) for {a mathematical formula}k=[1,N], which will be discussed very shortly.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Fitness interval selection in the sample space: We first record the variance {a mathematical formula}Vk(X → i) of the measured samples of the kth fitness of trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → i.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We measure the contribution of the fitness samples of the interval j to the fitness estimate of the trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → i by a probability measure {a mathematical formula}pj:{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula}nk,ij represents the number of samples of {a mathematical formula}fk(X → i) in the jth interval for {a mathematical formula}j=[1,L].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Expected fitness estimation: Let {a mathematical formula}fkj(X → i) be the median value of the fitness samples of {a mathematical formula}X → i in the jth interval, for {a mathematical formula}j=[1,L].</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We obtain the expected value — say, {a mathematical formula}E(fk(X → i))=f ‾ k(X → i) — of the kth fitness of {a mathematical formula}X → i by (9):{a mathematical formula}The expected value thus obtained provides a unique measure of the kth objective of {a mathematical formula}X → i from the noisy local distribution of its fitness samples over a wide space.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A higher value of this probability ensures proximity of the measured fitness samples to {a mathematical formula}f¯k(X → i) in the sample space.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It is thus evident that skewness is greatly influenced by the occurrence of rare noisy fitness samples far away from the expected value {a mathematical formula}f¯k(X → i).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The noisy version of the kth objective {a mathematical formula}fk(X → ), of any trial solution {a mathematical formula}X → , is given by{a mathematical formula} where {a mathematical formula} Η k represents the injected stochastic noise amplitude that follows a certain probability distribution function (PDF).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The uncertainty problem is resolved here by weighting the size of the objective space covered by a nondominated solution {a mathematical formula}X → with the probability that {a mathematical formula}X → dominates at least one population member.</a>
