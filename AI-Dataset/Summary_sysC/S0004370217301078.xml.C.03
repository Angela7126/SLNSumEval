<a href="#0" id="0">{a mathematical formula}jAg is the joint action of the set of n agents that make up Ag, and is a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 Α 1,..., Α n 〉 , where for each {a mathematical formula} Α j (where {a mathematical formula}j ≤ n) there is some {a mathematical formula}agi ∈ Ag such that {a mathematical formula} Α j ∈ Aci.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The set of all joint actions for the set of agents Ag is denoted by {a mathematical formula}JAg, so {a mathematical formula}JAg= ∏ i ∈ AgAci.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this game there are four joint actions which promote and demote values as shown in Table 2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the Ultimatum Game suppose that {a mathematical formula}prob(jointaction) is the probability of jointaction being performed when the agent making the argument chooses some particular individual action.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Now the values will be expected to be promoted and demoted according to the probability of the second player's response, as shown in Table 3, and so the expected utility can be calculated, taking account of the complete set of joint actions that include a particular individual action.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Expected utility of ag performing Α in state {a mathematical formula}qs</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}J Α ={j0,j1...jn} be the set of joint actions in which ag performs Α (i.e.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The action which ag wants to result from performing Α is {a mathematical formula}j0.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Let {a mathematical formula}prob(j0) be the probability of {a mathematical formula}j0 being the joint action performed when ag performs Α in {a mathematical formula}qs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Argument (2) is rather weak: although the expected utility is always positive, the proposed action may have a lower expected utility than the alternative for some (or even all) values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j1).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Joint Action Premise: {a mathematical formula}{j0,j1,...jn} is the set of joint actions in which ag performs Α .</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Expected Utility Premise: {a mathematical formula}euag( Α ,prob(j0)) returns the expected utilities of agent ag performing Α for values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j0) where {a mathematical formula}j0 is the desired joint action.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The fourth premise then establishes the expected utilities for the various probabilities of the desired joint action, {a mathematical formula}j0, resulting from ag performing Α .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Dominance Premise: {a mathematical formula}euag( Α ,j0) ≥ euag( Β ,j0) for any alternative action Β available to ag, for all values of {a mathematical formula}prob(j0); where {a mathematical formula}j0 is the joint action compliant with the action of ag.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">If there are only two joint actions containing Α , the Expected Utility Premise is fully determined by the labelling of transitions in the AATS+V, together with the Values and Weighting premises.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Once we have established which values we wish to consider, we can only challenge the characteristic premise of the Argument from Dominance by coming up with an alternative action Γ for which {a mathematical formula}euag( Γ ,j0)>euag( Α ,j0) for at least some probabilities of compliance.</a>
