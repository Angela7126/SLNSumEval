<a href="#0" id="0">The Ramsey test for non-monotonic inference{a mathematical formula}p| ∼ q holds if and only if {a mathematical formula}q ∈ K ⁎ p.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The co-occurrence test needs to be specified with respect to which of the belief sets containing p we should include in the analysis.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The co-occurrence test for non-monotonic inference{a mathematical formula}p| ∼ q holds if and only if q holds in all the p-satisfying belief change outcomes that are reasonably plausible as compared to other p-satisfying belief change outcomes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is usually assumed that if {a mathematical formula}p ∈ K, then {a mathematical formula}K ⁎ p=K.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">From this it follows directly that a relation ↣ that is based on ⁎ via the Ramsey test will satisfy CS.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, an operation {a mathematical formula}| ∼ based on the co-occurrence test will not in general do so.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Even if {a mathematical formula}K ⁎ p=K and {a mathematical formula}q ∈ K there may be other reasonably plausible p-containing belief sets that do not contain q, and then {a mathematical formula}p| ∼ q will not hold.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Belief revision in an exhaustive centrolinear model{a mathematical formula}K ⁎ p is the ≦ -minimal element of {a mathematical formula}X that contains p.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The Ramsey test in an exhaustive centrolinear model{a mathematical formula}p ↣ q holds if and only if {a mathematical formula}q ∈ K ⁎ p.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The co-occurrence test in an exhaustive and dilated centrolinear model{a mathematical formula}p| ∼ q holds if and only if it holds for all {a mathematical formula}Y ∈ X that if {a mathematical formula}K ⁎ p ≦ Y ≦ ℓ (K ⁎ p) and {a mathematical formula}p ∈ Y, then {a mathematical formula}q ∈ Y.</a>
