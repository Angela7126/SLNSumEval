<a href="#0" id="0">The intuition about {a mathematical formula}E1 is as follows: bridge rules in {a mathematical formula}E1 are crucial to create an inconsistency in M (i.e., {a mathematical formula}M[E1] ⊨ ⊥ ), moreover this inconsistency is relevant for M in the sense that adding some bridge rules from {a mathematical formula}br(M) to {a mathematical formula}M[E1] never yields a consistent system, i.e., {a mathematical formula}M[E1 ∪ R] ⊨ ⊥ for all {a mathematical formula}R ⊆ br(M).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, this can be achieved considering a transformed MCS: Consider {a mathematical formula}M=(C1, … ,Cn), then {a mathematical formula}Mr=(C1, … ,Cn,C Α ) is the transformed MCS where {a mathematical formula}C Α is a context whose acceptable belief states contain exactly those formulas added to it via bridge rules, e.g., {a mathematical formula}C Α uses the logic {a mathematical formula}Lasp and an empty knowledge base {a mathematical formula}kb Α = ∅ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our running example suggests that duality also holds for deletion-diagnoses and -explanations, which indeed is true: For every inconsistent MCS M,{a mathematical formula} ⋃ Dm − (M)= ⋃ Em+(M), i.e., the unions of all minimal deletion-diagnoses and all minimal deletion-inconsistency explanations coincide.This is a direct consequence of Theorem 4 (set in its proof the second components of diagnoses and explanations to the empty set).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An analogous property does not hold for inconsistency explanations: e.g., the bridge rule {a mathematical formula}r:(1:a) ← not(1:a) may cause an inconsistency which can be repaired only by adding {a mathematical formula}cf(r) to the system, hence the system has a minimal explanation {a mathematical formula}({r},{r}).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For all complexity considerations, we represent logics {a mathematical formula}Li of contexts {a mathematical formula}Ciimplicitly; they are fixed and we do not consider these (possibly infinite) objects to be part of the input of the decision problems we investigate.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consistency of an MCS M can be decided by a Turing machine with input M which (a) guesses an output-projected belief state {a mathematical formula}T ∈ OUT1× ⋯ ×OUTn, (b) evaluates the bridge rules on T, yielding for each context {a mathematical formula}Ci a set of active bridge rule heads {a mathematical formula}Hi w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">More in detail, if {a mathematical formula}LASP=(BS,KB,ACC), then BS is the collection of sets of atoms over a propositional alphabet Σ , KB is a set of logic programming rules over Σ , and given a knowledge base {a mathematical formula}kb ∈ KB, we define {a mathematical formula}ACC(kb)=AS(kb), i.e., the context accepts the set of answer sets of the logic program kb.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Since we are only interested in explanation candidates E where no equilibrium exists for any {a mathematical formula}(R1,R2) ∈ Rg(E), a constraint is added to ensure that only saturated models comprise an answer set, i.e, we ensure that only {a mathematical formula}I ⋆ may yield an answer set.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">{a mathematical formula}PE(M), on the input MCS M. mcs-ie enumerates answer sets of the rewritten program, and potentially uses a ⊆ -minimization module, and a module which realizes the conversions between diagnosis and explanation notions as described in Theorem 2 and Corollary 1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Disregarding possible rule preferences, a logic program P with CR rules CR can be embedded to an MCS {a mathematical formula}M=(C1), where the single context {a mathematical formula}C1 is over disjunctive logic programs, such that the answer sets of P with CR correspond to the witnessing equilibria of the minimal diagnoses {a mathematical formula}(D1,D2) of M. In more detail, {a mathematical formula}C1 has the knowledge base {a mathematical formula}kb1=P ∪ {cr(r)|r ∈ CR} and bridge rules {a mathematical formula}br1={(c1:ab(r)) ← a ⊥ .|r ∈ CR}, where {a mathematical formula}a ⊥ and {a mathematical formula}ab(r) are fresh atoms, for each r as above, and{a mathematical formula} informally, unconditional firing of a bridge rule simulates the corresponding CR rule; note that {a mathematical formula}D1= ∅ .</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Indeed, for the MCS {a mathematical formula}M=(C1) with single context {a mathematical formula}C1 having knowledge base {a mathematical formula}kb1=K and bridge rules {a mathematical formula}br1=br Γ ⊤ ∪ br Γ ⊥ , where {a mathematical formula}br Γ ⊤ ={(c1: Φ ) ← (c1: ⊤ )| Φ ∈ Γ } and {a mathematical formula}br Γ ⊥ ={(c1: Φ ) ← (c1: ⊥ )| Φ ∈ Γ }, then the minimal diagnoses of M correspond to the repairs of K. One may replace Γ with {a mathematical formula} Γ O in both, {a mathematical formula}br Γ ⊤ and {a mathematical formula}br Γ ⊥ ; furthermore, modified bodies in {a mathematical formula}br Γ ⊤ allow for conditional removal of formulas, with conditions that might be beyond the expressiveness of the language of K. As regards explanations, our notion of explanation has no counterpart in the approach of [62].</a>
