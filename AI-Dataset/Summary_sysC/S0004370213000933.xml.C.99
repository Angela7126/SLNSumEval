<a href="#0" id="0">The first phase starts after initialization and finishes until two Pareto optimal solutions for {a mathematical formula}q1 and {a mathematical formula}qr respectively are found.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The second phase finishes until the optimal Pareto front is found.In the first phase, two minimum spanning trees with respect to {a mathematical formula}w1 and {a mathematical formula}w2 respectively have been found after the initialization procedure.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, we are to analyze the expected running time until a Pareto optimal solution {a mathematical formula}T1 ⁎ for {a mathematical formula}q1 is found.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">{a mathematical formula}T1 ⁎ is actually a minimum spanning tree for {a mathematical formula}w1; meanwhile, it is also Pareto optimal, i.e., it has the minimum weight for {a mathematical formula}w2 among all minimum spanning trees for {a mathematical formula}w1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Note that, a minimum spanning tree for {a mathematical formula}w1 will be always existed in the population, because it has the minimum value on the first objective {a mathematical formula}f1 with respect to {a mathematical formula}w1, and a non-minimum spanning tree for {a mathematical formula}w1 has a larger value on {a mathematical formula}f1 and thus cannot dominate it.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let {a mathematical formula}T1 denote the minimum spanning tree for {a mathematical formula}w1 in the current population.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Then, we analyze the expected running time for constructing {a mathematical formula}T1 ⁎ from {a mathematical formula}T1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As {a mathematical formula}T1 ⁎ is a minimum spanning tree for {a mathematical formula}w1, from [32], we know that there exists a bijection Α from {a mathematical formula}E(T1 ⁎ ) − E(T1) to {a mathematical formula}E(T1) − E(T1 ⁎ ) such that for each edge {a mathematical formula}e ∈ E(T1 ⁎ ) − E(T1), {a mathematical formula} Α (e) ∈ Cyc(T1,e) and {a mathematical formula}w1(e) ⩽ w1( Α (e)), where {a mathematical formula}Cyc(T1,e) is the cycle led by the insertion of e into {a mathematical formula}T1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Then, for good crossover, the probability of generating a new {a mathematical formula}qi in one step is at least {a mathematical formula}12 ⋅ (12 ⋅ 1|P| − 1) ⋅ 1m, where {a mathematical formula}12 is the probability of applying crossover, {a mathematical formula}(12 ⋅ 1|P| − 1) is the probability of selecting two specific Pareto optimal solutions and {a mathematical formula}1m is the probability of selecting a proper crossover point; and for good mutation, the probability of generating a new {a mathematical formula}qi in one step is at least {a mathematical formula}12 ⋅ 1|P| − 1 ⋅ 1m2(1 − 1m)m − 2 by Lemma 6, where {a mathematical formula}12 is the probability of applying mutation, {a mathematical formula}1|P| − 1 is the lower bound for the probability of selecting a specific solution, and {a mathematical formula}1m2(1 − 1m)m − 2 is the probability of flipping two specific bits.</a>
