<a href="#0" id="0">First, the analysis of conditions that entail acyclicity of games and game forms is crucial to the understanding of iterative voting scenarios and the ability to properly compare their convergence properties (e.g., convergence of any best reply dynamics is a special case of order-free acyclicity and convergence under a particular order of voters implies weak acyclicity).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The final score of a candidate c for a given profile {a mathematical formula}a ∈ An in the Plurality game form {a mathematical formula}fs ˆ ,w is the sum of the initial score and the total weight of strategic voters that vote for c. We denote the final score vector by {a mathematical formula}ss ˆ ,w,a (often just {a mathematical formula}sa or s when the other parameters are clear from the context), where {a mathematical formula}s(c)=s ˆ (c)+ ∑ i ∈ N:ai=cwi.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, a game form f has the X property (where X is any of the above versions of finite improvement) if {a mathematical formula} 〈 f,L 〉 is X for all preference profiles {a mathematical formula}L ∈ (L(C))n. Since some convergence properties entail others, we describe these entailments in Fig.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The properties of strong, weak and order-free convergence can be defined in the same way as for best and better replies, where the only difference is in the way of defining the set {a mathematical formula}Ii(a) (i.e., the set of all steps that are allowed for agent i at state a by the considered heuristics).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However the number of possible action profiles is exponential in n. We will define a voting rule/game form with {a mathematical formula}2n+1 outcomes, such that almost all {a mathematical formula}2n profiles yield the same outcome z, with “ special ” profiles that are few (only 2n) and far between (several steps are required to get from one special profile to another).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Every voting function {a mathematical formula}fn is a function from the n dimensional binary cube {a mathematical formula}B={0,1}n to C.The challenge is to “ pack ” our 2n special profiles corresponding to {a mathematical formula}X ∪ Y in this cube such that they are “ far between. ” Fortunately, coding theory deals with exactly this type of challenges, albeit for very different reasons.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For {a mathematical formula}n ≤ 6 such a construction is impossible, since any function with {a mathematical formula}2n+1 distinct outcomes will necessarily contain a cycle.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Suppose that agent i has an improvement step (i.e., better reply) {a mathematical formula}ait − 1 → iait at time t. We classify all possible steps into the following types (an example of such a step appears in parentheses):</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus a cannot be a direct reply for any voter j, and (II) still holds after step {a mathematical formula}t ′ .It remains to show that (I) holds.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The following cycle consists of individual improvement steps of the strategic voters (the vector denotes the votes {a mathematical formula}(a1,a2) at time t, and the winner appears in curly brackets):{a mathematical formula} Note that all steps are best replies, but the steps of agent 1 are indirect.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It remains an open question whether there is any restriction on better replies that guarantees order-free acyclicity in weighted games, i.e., if {a mathematical formula}fwPL is order-free-FIP for any {a mathematical formula}n>2 and weights w. However, Proposition 4.6 shows that if such a restricted order-free dynamic exists, it must make use of indirect replies, which is rather unnatural.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The extended relation {a mathematical formula}Li is just a partial order over subsets of C, but nonetheless this is sufficient to prove our main result in this section.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We get the following cyclic sequence:{a mathematical formula} We emphasize that each step is justified as a better reply by either Axiom K or Axiom G. For example, in the step of agent 2 in the top row, agent 2 prefers {a mathematical formula}b ≻ 2a, and thus {a mathematical formula}b ≻ 2{a,b} by Axiom G. This will be used later in Section 4.4.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Fortunately, we can show that some of these cases immediately lead to a contradiction, and in the other cases all invariants 1 – 5 will hold after step t.Consider first the case {a mathematical formula}a ∈ Wt − 1.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Another way to derive a well-defined dynamics from any partial order{a mathematical formula}Li over subsets of candidates, is by assuming that a voter performs a better reply step if she strictly prefers the new outcome according to {a mathematical formula}Li, and otherwise (if the new outcome is same, worse, or incomparable) she does not move.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We have seen in Section 4 that while {a mathematical formula}fPR is FBRP from the truthful initial state, this is no longer true from arbitrary states, and in fact {a mathematical formula}fPR is not order-free-FIP under any action scheduler.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Then similarly to case 1, i has a direct step {a mathematical formula}b0 → ibi ⁎ , which results in a state {a mathematical formula}b ′ that is closer to being truthful.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">However, if we think of {a mathematical formula}fPR as a deterministic game form with {a mathematical formula}2m − 1 possible outcomes (all nonempty subsets of candidates), where agents are restricted to m actions each, then the allowed utility profiles are constrained (by Axioms G and R) and thus this result does not settle Kukushkin's question completely.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">This game was used in Section 4.1 to demonstrate that Plurality with weighted voters is not FDRP, however it can be verified that this game is order-free-FIP so it is not good enough for our use.If we ignore the agents' preferences, we get a particular game form {a mathematical formula}fs ˆ ,wPL where {a mathematical formula}N={1,2,3}, {a mathematical formula}M={a,b,c,d}, {a mathematical formula}s ˆ =(0,1,2,3) and {a mathematical formula}w=(1,2,3).We define {a mathematical formula}f ⁎ by modifying {a mathematical formula}fs ˆ ,wPL with the following restrictions on agents' actions: {a mathematical formula}A1={c,d},A2={b,c}, and {a mathematical formula}A3={a,b,d}.</a>
