<a href="#0" id="0">Using this definition, a PR algorithm is complete if it returns a hypothesis set H such that {a mathematical formula}h ∼ rh ⁎ → h ∈ H, that is, H contains all possible hypotheses that can be refined to {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A PR algorithm is sound if for every hypothesis {a mathematical formula}h ∈ H → h ∼ rh ⁎ .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Definition 7</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Query functionA query QA is a function that receives as input a plan p and outputs whether one of the plans in the correct hypothesis {a mathematical formula}h ⁎ can be refined from p.{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Definition 11</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">SPR problemAn SPR problem is defined by a tuple {a mathematical formula} 〈 L,H0 〉 , where L is a plan library and {a mathematical formula}H0 is a set of hypotheses that explain some observation sequence with respect to L. A solution to the SPR problem is an SPR process with a query policy that decides which plans to select in order to reduce the size of {a mathematical formula}H0 with as few queries as possible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Algorithm 1 receives as input a set of hypotheses with {a mathematical formula}|H| hypotheses.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It iteratively chooses a query and updates the hypothesis set.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We will now compute the runtime complexity of each such iteration, given that P is the number of plans in the hypothesis set and {a mathematical formula}maxP is the number of nodes in the largest plan.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The first step of each iteration of Algorithm 1 is choosing which plan to query.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let {a mathematical formula}Subs(P) be the set of all subplans and full plans that are refinements of a plan from the set of plans P. To implement the query process using subplans, we only need to change the query function Π in Algorithm 1 to choose any subplan in {a mathematical formula}Subs(P).</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We now show how we adapt the query policies defined in Section 3.2.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Proposition 1</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Let {a mathematical formula}H ′ ⊆ H be the set of hypotheses remaining after convergence of the SPR process.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Any hypothesis that was discarded ({a mathematical formula}h ∈ H ∖ H ′ ) by using complete plans will also be discarded by querying with subplans (and vice versa).</a>
