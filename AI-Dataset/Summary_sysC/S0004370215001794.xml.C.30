<a href="#0" id="0">In scientific computing and in realistic graphic animation, simulation – that is, step-by-step calculation of the complete trajectory of a physical system – is one of the most common and important modes of calculation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this article, we address the scope and limits of the use of simulation, with respect to AI tasks that involve high-level physical reasoning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We discuss twelve features of physical reasoning problems that pose challenges for simulation-based reasoning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We briefly survey alternative techniques for physical reasoning that do not rely on simulation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, we review twelve challenges that arise in the construction of simulations, some widely known, others less so; together, they help to articulate the scope and limits of when simulation can and cannot serve as an appropriate tool for automated physical reasoning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In some cases, reasoning about a physical system can be carried out more reliably and effectively using extra-physical information.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">One common method for using simulations in situations with partial knowledge is to use Monte Carlo methods, or probabilistic simulation [26], [49].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given a probability distribution over a space of physical situations, a program generates some large collection of specific situations following the distribution; it carries out a simulation based on each of these; and then it considers these behaviors as a random sample of the possible behaviors.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If the generator is to be created by the automated reasoner, and not supplied by a human programmer, then that in itself would require powerful spatial and physical reasoning capacities that can hardly be the product of unaided simulation.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If the only goal is to infer that the object remains inside the container, then simulation is at best extremely inefficient and at worst essentially impossible.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">One could perhaps simulate that as well, but obviously the reasoning needed to figure out that this simulation is relevant and to set up the simulation is much more complex than the simulation itself.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">There must be a well-defined process to exclude irrelevant information in physical reasoning, and it is hard to see how this exclusion process itself can rely on simulation.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">If there is a human in the loop, they can examine the output of the simulator and at least see that this cannot be right, particularly if the simulator outputs an animation.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">If there is no human in the loop, then it would be very desirable for the physical reasoning system to be able to detect these kinds of problems by itself.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">If the simulation is the only reasoning mechanism, this cannot be done.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Simulation is effective for automated physical reasoning when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of scales involved, both temporal and spatial, is not extreme.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Probabilistic simulation can be effective when a plausible probability distribution can be posited, and when it is easy to generate a random sample of instances satisfying the known constraints.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The problems of incomplete information, irrelevant information, range of scale, non-predictive tasks, and the frame problem have been examined only to a limited degree, and the technical literature within the theory of modeling and simulation is small.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">For simulation to serve as a general solution to the problem of physical reasoning, in either human or automated form, all would need to be solved.</a>
