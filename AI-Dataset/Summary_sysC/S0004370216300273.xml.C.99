<a href="#0" id="0">For instance, consider a modular program{a mathematical formula} There is no set of atoms that yields an answer set to both logic programs {a mathematical formula}{a ← } and {a mathematical formula}{b ← } simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, in our earlier work we proposed the input answer set semantics as the semantics for individual logic programs, that lends a way to defining a meaningful semantics of modular logic programs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this example, the set {a mathematical formula}{a,b} of atoms is a model of modular logic program (8), as it is an input answer set of each of the component programs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Every program Π is input-equivalent to the module{a mathematical formula}UPUF ′ ( Π ).By definition, X is an input answer set of Π if and only if X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ∪ (X ∖ Head( Π )).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By Proposition 5, X is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ∪ (X ∖ Head( Π )) if and only if X is a model of {a mathematical formula}UPUF( Π ∪ (X ∖ Head( Π ))).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, to complete the proof it suffices to show that X is a model of {a mathematical formula}UPUF ′ ( Π ) if and only if X is a model of {a mathematical formula}UPUF( Π ∪ (X ∖ Head( Π ))).Let us assume that X is a model of {a mathematical formula}UPUF( Π ∪ (X ∖ Head( Π ))).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let {a mathematical formula}(M,l) be an inference of {a mathematical formula}UPUF ′ ( Π ) such that M is consistent with X.</a>
