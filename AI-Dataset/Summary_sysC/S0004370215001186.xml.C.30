<a href="#0" id="0">We study the notion of context permeability, using a game in which agents try to achieve global consensus.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We design and analyse two different models of permeability.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the first model, agents interact concurrently in multiple social networks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this article, we explore the modelling of opinion dynamics with multiple social networks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We look at how the properties of different network models influence the convergence to opinion consensus.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We present a series of models that use these networks in different ways: which create distinct emergent dynamics.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We want to study the consequences of using multiple social networks at the same time while maintaining the interaction model as simple and abstract as possible (following the methodology in most opinion dynamics literature).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We present two models where agents can: interact at the same time in the multiple networks (choosing partners from any network); or switch between networks (choosing only partners from their current network).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the next section, we present the work related to opinion dynamics, social space modelling and complex network models.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the following section, we describe our game of consensus and introduce our multiple model variations.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">These are designed to study the notion of context permeability and consensus formation in multiple social networks.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In this section, we present work related to opinion dynamics, social space modelling, and complex network models.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In the context switching model [12] (Model 2), agents are embedded in multiple relations (represented as static social networks).</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Agents switch contexts with a probability {a mathematical formula} Î– Ci associated with context {a mathematical formula}Ci: this switching probability is the same for every agent in a given network.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The agents are only active in one context at a time, and can only perform encounters with neighbours in the same context.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">We can think of context switching as a temporary deployment in another place, such as what happens with temporary immigration.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">The network topology is static; when an agent switches from one network to another, they become inactive in one network and active in their destination.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The social networks used in our models are k-regular and scale-free.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">A k-regular network is a network where all the nodes have the same number of connections.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">These networks are constructed by arranging the nodes in a ring and connecting each node to their next k neighbours.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">Each network has 2k edges per vertex.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Consider Fig.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Fig.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">4 shows the average value for the average path length of 100 k-regular network instances (each with 100 nodes).</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">We can see that the average path length changes more drastically when we go from 1 to 2 networks.</a>

<a href="#30" id="30">In this section, we discuss the results for various sets of experiments on the context permeability model[29], [30].</a>
<a href="#31" id="31">First, we used k-regular and scale-free networks with our model.</a>

<a href="#36" id="36">Fig.</a>
<a href="#37" id="37">(We don't include the configuration for one network and {a mathematical formula}d=1 because these never converge.)</a>
<a href="#38" id="38">The convergence ratio is very low for the configurations with one network {a mathematical formula}d=2 and 2 networks with {a mathematical formula}d=1; hence the high number of encounters (see also Table 3).</a>
<a href="#39" id="39">We also performed experiments with mixed network topologies: we used one scale-free and one k-regular networks.</a>
<a href="#40" id="40">Table 5 shows the convergence ratio for the heterogeneous network configuration with the multiple values for d and k for the scale-free and k-regular respectively.</a>
