<a href="#0" id="0">The final score of a candidate c for a given profile {a mathematical formula}a ∈ An in the Plurality game form {a mathematical formula}fs ˆ ,w is the sum of the initial score and the total weight of strategic voters that vote for c. We denote the final score vector by {a mathematical formula}ss ˆ ,w,a (often just {a mathematical formula}sa or s when the other parameters are clear from the context), where {a mathematical formula}s(c)=s ˆ (c)+ ∑ i ∈ N:ai=cwi.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The properties of strong, weak and order-free convergence can be defined in the same way as for best and better replies, where the only difference is in the way of defining the set {a mathematical formula}Ii(a) (i.e., the set of all steps that are allowed for agent i at state a by the considered heuristics).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However the number of possible action profiles is exponential in n. We will define a voting rule/game form with {a mathematical formula}2n+1 outcomes, such that almost all {a mathematical formula}2n profiles yield the same outcome z, with “ special ” profiles that are few (only 2n) and far between (several steps are required to get from one special profile to another).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given some score vector s, we denote by {a mathematical formula}s¨(c) ∈ R the score of {a mathematical formula}c ∈ C that includes the lexicographic tie-breaking component.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One way to formally define it is by setting {a mathematical formula}s¨(c)=s(c)+1m+1(m − L(c)), where {a mathematical formula}L(c) is the lexicographic index of candidate c. However the only important property of {a mathematical formula}s¨ is that {a mathematical formula}s¨(c)>s¨(c ′ ) if either {a mathematical formula}s(c)>s(c ′ ) or the score is equal and c has a higher priority (lower index) than {a mathematical formula}c ′ .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, for Plurality with lexicographic tie-breaking, a given weight vector w and a given initial score vector {a mathematical formula}s ˆ , we denote the outcome by{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As with s, we omit the scripts {a mathematical formula}w,s ˆ and PL when they are clear from the context.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">It remains an open question whether there is any restriction on better replies that guarantees order-free acyclicity in weighted games, i.e., if {a mathematical formula}fwPL is order-free-FIP for any {a mathematical formula}n>2 and weights w. However, Proposition 4.6 shows that if such a restricted order-free dynamic exists, it must make use of indirect replies, which is rather unnatural.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We thus conjecture that such order-free dynamics do not exist.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The extended relation {a mathematical formula}Li is just a partial order over subsets of C, but nonetheless this is sufficient to prove our main result in this section.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Suppose there is a better reply {a mathematical formula}ait − 1 → ib at time {a mathematical formula}t − 1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">As some best reply always exists, denote by {a mathematical formula}b ′ an arbitrary best reply.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Let {a mathematical formula}W=Fs ˆ ,wP(a − it − 1,b ′ ), and let {a mathematical formula}a ′ be the most preferred candidate of i in W. Then we argue that {a mathematical formula}ait − 1 → ia ′ is a direct best reply of i.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Since {a mathematical formula}a ′ is a direct reply by definition, it is left to show that {a mathematical formula}a ′ is a best reply (for the lexicographic case this follows immediately from {a mathematical formula}W={a ′ } and {a mathematical formula}fPL(a − it − 1,a ′ )=W={a ′ }).If {a mathematical formula}b ′ is a direct reply then {a mathematical formula}b ′ =a ′ and we are done.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Thus assume that {a mathematical formula}b ′ is not a direct reply from {a mathematical formula}ait − 1.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Then {a mathematical formula}b ′ ∉ W.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">By voting for {a mathematical formula}a ′ ∈ W, we get that {a mathematical formula}Fs ˆ ,wP(a − it − 1,a ′ )={a ′ }, i.e., {a mathematical formula}a ′ remains the unique winner.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Another way to derive a well-defined dynamics from any partial order{a mathematical formula}Li over subsets of candidates, is by assuming that a voter performs a better reply step if she strictly prefers the new outcome according to {a mathematical formula}Li, and otherwise (if the new outcome is same, worse, or incomparable) she does not move.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">We have seen in Section 4 that while {a mathematical formula}fPR is FBRP from the truthful initial state, this is no longer true from arbitrary states, and in fact {a mathematical formula}fPR is not order-free-FIP under any action scheduler.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">However, if we think of {a mathematical formula}fPR as a deterministic game form with {a mathematical formula}2m − 1 possible outcomes (all nonempty subsets of candidates), where agents are restricted to m actions each, then the allowed utility profiles are constrained (by Axioms G and R) and thus this result does not settle Kukushkin's question completely.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">We must have {a mathematical formula}x ≻ iy for any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X,y ∈ Y ′ , otherwise, a tie-breaking order that selects y first and x second would make i strictly lose when moving from Y to X.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Similarly, {a mathematical formula}x ≻ iy for any {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X ′ ,y ∈ Y.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">If {a mathematical formula}Z= ∅ then {a mathematical formula}X=X ′ ≻ iY ′ =Y follows from Axiom K. Otherwise, by repeatedly applying Axiom G we get {a mathematical formula}X ⪰ iZ ⪰ iY with at least one relation being strict.In the other direction, since Axiom G can only be used to add elements lower (or higher) than all existing elements, it may only induce relations of the form {a mathematical formula}Z ≻ Z ∪ Y ′ where {a mathematical formula}z ≻ y for all {a mathematical formula}z ∈ Z,y ∈ Y ′ ; or relations of the form {a mathematical formula}Z ∪ X ′ ≻ Z where {a mathematical formula}x ≻ z for all {a mathematical formula}z ∈ Z,x ∈ X ′ .</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Thus if {a mathematical formula}X ≻ Y follows from Axiom G, they must have the form {a mathematical formula}X=Z ∪ X ′ ,Y=Z ∪ Y ′ where {a mathematical formula}x ≻ z ≻ y for all {a mathematical formula}x ∈ X ′ ,z ∈ Z,y ∈ Y ′ .</a>
