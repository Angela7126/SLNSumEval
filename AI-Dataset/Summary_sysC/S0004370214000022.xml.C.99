<a href="#0" id="0">Since the formulas in {a mathematical formula} Φ ⁎ are not composed of probability formulas, and thus do not involve any reasoning about interpretations, we can extend the function {a mathematical formula} Π i( ⋅ ) to {a mathematical formula} Φ ⁎ in a straightforward way, and write {a mathematical formula}[[ Φ ]]i for the set of the states of the world where the formula {a mathematical formula} Φ ∈ Φ ⁎ is true according to i.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Roughly speaking, this means that {a mathematical formula} Π i( Ω ) should consist of all states where the formula {a mathematical formula} Φ i, Ω is true.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can define {a mathematical formula} ⊨ in,ai in an analogous way.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, the semantics for formulas that do not involve probability formulas are as given by {a mathematical formula} ⊨ in, while the semantics of probability formulas is defined as follows (where M is assumed to satisfy A5, which is the appropriate assumption for the innermost-scope semantics):{a mathematical formula} Note that although we have written {a mathematical formula}[[ Φ j, Ω ]]iin,ai, since {a mathematical formula} Φ j, Ω is a propositional formula, {a mathematical formula}[[ Φ j, Ω ]]iin,ai=[[ Φ j, Ω ]]iout,ai=[[ Φ j, Ω ]]iout=[[ Φ j, Ω ]]iin.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is important that {a mathematical formula} Φ j, Ω is a propositional formula here; otherwise, we would have circularities in the definition, and would somehow need to define {a mathematical formula}[[ Φ j, Ω ]]iin,ai.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Again, here it may be instructive to consider the definition of {a mathematical formula}Bj Φ in the case that {a mathematical formula} Μ j, Ω is discrete for all Ω .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this case, {a mathematical formula}Bj becomes the set {a mathematical formula}{( Ω , Ω ′ ): Ν j( Ω ′ |[[ Φ j, Ω ]]jin,ai)>0.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">That is, state {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ is considered possible by player j in state Ω if agent j gives {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ positive probability after conditioning his prior {a mathematical formula} Ν j on (his interpretation of) the information {a mathematical formula} Φ j, Ω he receives in state Ω .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">With this definition of {a mathematical formula}Bj, we have, as expected, {a mathematical formula}(M, Ω ,i) ⊨ in,aiBj Φ iff {a mathematical formula}(M, Ω ′ ,i) ⊨ in,ai Φ for all {a mathematical formula} Ω ′ such that {a mathematical formula}( Ω , Ω ′ ) ∈ Bj.</a>
