<a href="#0" id="0">In this setting, the solution to a weak controllability problem has the form of a strategy that given a situation computes an assignment to the controllable time points.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Definition 4 captures the weak controllability concept by requiring the existence of a schedule for each situation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This definition implicitly models a strategy as a function {a mathematical formula}f: Ω P → R|Xc| that maps each situation Ω in a schedule for the controllable time points that fulfills the constraints of the projection {a mathematical formula}P Ω .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If such a function exists, the problem is weakly controllable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Intuitively, a temporal problem is weakly controllable if there exists a strategy that maps every situation to a corresponding assignment to controllable time points, in such a way that all free constraints are satisfied.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">If we interpret the vector of time points {a mathematical formula}X → c and the vector of durations {a mathematical formula}Y → u as vectors of real variables, and the set of constraints {a mathematical formula} Γ (Y → u) and {a mathematical formula} Ψ (X → c,Y → u) as formulae in {a mathematical formula}QF_LRA, Eq.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">(1) becomes a formula in {a mathematical formula}LRA that is valid if and only if the problem is weakly controllable.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">From here on, we assume the encoding {a mathematical formula}(X → c,Y → u, Γ (Y → u), Ψ (X → c,Y → u)) of a TPU is given.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In general, a weak strategy is a function that maps each assignment to uncontrollable durations satisfying {a mathematical formula} Γ (Y → u) (i.e.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In order to graphically explain the reason why no linear strategy exists for the given problem, we plotted the space of free constraints of the STPU problem in the space {a mathematical formula}(y1,y2,b2) regions in Figs.</a>
