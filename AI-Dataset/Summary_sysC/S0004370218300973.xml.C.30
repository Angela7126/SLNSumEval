<a href="#0" id="0">More specifically, we employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of crowd traffic.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For each property, we design a branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial properties of crowd traffic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different weights to different branches and regions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we predict two types of crowd flows [3]: inflow and outflow, as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Fig.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We summarize the temporal properties of crowd flows into three categories, consisting of temporal closeness, period, and trend.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">ST-ResNet uses three different residual networks to model these properties, respectively.</a>

<a href="#9" id="9">3 adopts a few 2-channel flows matrices of intervals in the recent time to model temporal closeness dependency.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let the recent fragment be {a mathematical formula}[Xt − lc,Xt − (lc − 1), ⋯ ,Xt − 1], which is also known as the closeness dependent sequence.</a>
