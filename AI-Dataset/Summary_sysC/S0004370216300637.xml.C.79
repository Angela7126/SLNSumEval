<a href="#0" id="0">For example, all the sentences concerned are universal, so every {a mathematical formula}( Σ ↑ )wI is preserved under submodels.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If{a mathematical formula} Σ ↑ is the lift of an inheritance network{a mathematical formula} 〈 V, Σ 〉 and is coherent, then{a mathematical formula}( Σ ↑ )WI ⊨ ( Σ ↑ )WI ∈ .Mostly analogous to the proof of Theorem A.7, but we need to look more closely at Case (ii).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let {a mathematical formula}A be a model in which {a mathematical formula} ∀ xPix is true, and {a mathematical formula} ∀ x¬Ab Α x is true for all {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ X, while the extension of the remaining predicates is determined by applying the rules in {a mathematical formula} Σ ↑ .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then Y is a conflicting set relative to {a mathematical formula}vi.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since X is a minimal exception set for {a mathematical formula}vi, some {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Y must be in X.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Assume towards contradiction that X is not a minimal exception set for {a mathematical formula}vi, and that {a mathematical formula}X ′ ⊂ X is.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By Proposition A.15, {a mathematical formula}B models some acceptable exception set Y for {a mathematical formula}vi.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, X is not an acceptable exception set for {a mathematical formula}vj.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this case there is a negative path from {a mathematical formula}vj to itself of which no element is in X.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Since this path is a contradicting set relative to {a mathematical formula}vj, it follows that X is not an acceptable exception set for {a mathematical formula}vj.</a>
