<a href="#0" id="0">ASPIC{sup:+} studies first order classical logic instantiations in which arguments are built from premises in a given base {a mathematical formula}B, and strict inference rules {a mathematical formula}{ Φ 1, … , Φ n → Φ | Φ ∈ Cn({ Φ 1, … , Φ n}}.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence arguments can be represented as in Definition 6, where an argument's premises entail an argument's conclusion through application of a single strict inference rule encoding the entailment condition 1 in Definition 6.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A ‘ preferred subtheory ’ (ps) is obtained by taking a maximal (under set inclusion) consistent subset of {a mathematical formula}B1, maximally extended with a subset of {a mathematical formula}B2, and so on.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Multiple ps may be constructed, and [43] shows that with undermine attacks defined over the arguments {a mathematical formula}A defined by {a mathematical formula}B, and the defeats {a mathematical formula}D obtained using the Elitist preference, then each ps corresponds to the premises of arguments in a stable extension of ({a mathematical formula}A,D).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Hence, Α is classically entailed from a ps iff Α is the conclusion of an argument in a stable extension.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then Α is a sceptical (credulous) ps-inference iff Α is entailed by all (respectively at least one) ps, iff Α is a sceptical (credulous) argumentation defined inference (i.e., Α is the conclusion of an argument in all, respectively at least one, stable extension(s)).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">{sup:7} This is clearly unfeasible for agents with limited resources, given the undecidability of first order classical logic, and that even in the propositional case, deciding whether {a mathematical formula} Δ ⊢ c Α is in general NP-hard, and therefore most likely intractable.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Moreover, for each argument constructed, one must not only check consistency of the premises but also that they are subset-minimal; a problem in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy [30], so that in the worst case, for every constructed argument {a mathematical formula}( Δ , Α ) one needs to verify that {a mathematical formula} ∀ Δ ′ ⊂ Δ , {a mathematical formula} Δ ′ ⊬ c Α .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Hence, to accommodate uses by resource-bounded agents, one needs to study the outcomes of argument evaluation assuming AFs that may include only a subset of the arguments defined by a base (which henceforth we refer to as partially instantiatedAFs) and avoid enforcing checks on the legitimacy of arguments before inclusion in an AF.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Note that a defeat by a falsum argument {a mathematical formula}X=( Δ , Γ , ⋏ ) on Y indicates that under the assumption that the premises Δ is true, the ‘ supposed premises ’ (i.e., suppositions) Γ in S are inconsistent, and Y in particular is targeted since at least one of the suppositions in Γ is also a premise of Y. AttacksLet {a mathematical formula}A be a set of dialectical arguments defined by {a mathematical formula}B.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It suffices that the assumptions of arguments with conflicting conclusions (i.e., {a mathematical formula}A1 and {a mathematical formula}F1) be combined to yield a falsum argument (i.e., {a mathematical formula}X1), which we argue is a less demanding, and indeed more intuitive assumption as to the arguments that an agent can construct.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Rather, given a constructed argument {a mathematical formula}( Δ , Γ , Α ), the practical meaning of P2 is that any differential labelling of the assumptions in {a mathematical formula} Δ ∪ Γ is accessible to an agent when using the argument dialectically.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Suppose we now add s to {a mathematical formula}B, and suppose the defined arguments in Fig.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence, given an argument represented as {a mathematical formula}({p,¬p,r,r → q}, ∅ ,q) it may be that q is derived from {a mathematical formula}r,r → q, or explosively from {a mathematical formula}p,¬p; there is no way of telling which is the case without reference to the proof theory.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Note that the same reasoning applies to {a mathematical formula}({p,¬p}, ∅ ,q ∨ ¬q) in that the tautology may be derived from empty assumptions or explosively.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Now, as will be shown in Section 4, one can define proof theories that do not generate R-contaminated arguments (such as {a mathematical formula}C ′ ).</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We have therefore defined non-redundant {a mathematical formula}pdAFs that only need satisfy the property P4 ′ implied by P4, and as shown in the following section, need not assume redundance-coherent preference relations (given the absence of R-contaminated arguments) in order that the non-contamination postulates are satisfied.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Assumptions on preference relations in (non-redundant) {a mathematical formula}pdAFsIn the following results, when referring to {a mathematical formula}pdAFs in general, we will assume {a mathematical formula}pdAFs defined by preference relations that satisfy Pref1 (and hence the results can make use of Lemma 27) and are redundance-coherent.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">When referring to non-redundant {a mathematical formula}pdAFs, we assume only that the preference relations satisfy Pref1.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">(That there exists such an {a mathematical formula}E ′ with {a mathematical formula}E ′ ∖ E ≠ ∅ , can be seen by the limiting case in which {a mathematical formula}E ′ ∖ E is the set of unassailable arguments in {a mathematical formula}A ∖ A1; these are acceptable w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">It is the means by which the conclusion is obtained that renders the argument understandable, and furthermore, one would not want to rely on the recipient expending resources to reconstruct the proof from assumptions to conclusion (we revisit this issue in Section 5 when discussing the ‘ transparency ’ postulate proposed for practical applications [27]).</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">k-depth C-intelim argumentsLet {a mathematical formula}T be any normal C-intelimk proof of Φ depending on Σ (recall – Definition 30 – that Σ are the actual, and not virtual assumptions in {a mathematical formula}T), where {a mathematical formula} ∀ Α ∈ Σ , Α is annotated in {a mathematical formula}T by {an inline-figure} or {an inline-figure}, where {an inline-figure} stands for “ premise ” and {an inline-figure} stands for “ supposition ” .Then {a mathematical formula}( Δ , Γ , Φ ) is a C-intelimk argument, where {a mathematical formula} Δ ∪ Γ = Σ , {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Δ iff Α is annotated by {an inline-figure}, and {a mathematical formula} Α ∈ Γ iff Α is annotated by {an inline-figure}.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">This paper also additionally: 1) formally proves the Fundamental Lemma and existence of a unique least fixed point of a {a mathematical formula}pdAF's characteristic function; 2) provides a comprehensive study of two types of contaminated arguments; 3) formally proves the non-interference and crash resistance postulates, generalised here to first order argumentation; 4) studies instantiation of {a mathematical formula}pdAFs by natural deduction proof theories that exclude R-contaminated arguments and accommodate agents that have bounds on their inferential capabilities.</a>
