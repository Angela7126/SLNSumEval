<a href="#0" id="0">This is the first study to use taxonomies of items and SAs to address the sparsity problem while maintaining the semantic relationships expressed by linked information for tags assigned by users to items.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our method can measure the similarity of users based on items or SAs assigned to items by users, as well as using the item classes, which include the item and the that SCs contain the SAs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This approach overcomes the sparsity problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We assume that the interests of users are similar if they rate the same items using the same SAs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In addition, we try to measure the similarity of user interests, even if the users rate few items with SAs that are similar to other words.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, Linked Taxonomies measures the similarity of user interests based on the SAs and the SCs assigned to transacted items.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The approach described above measures the similarity of users based on linked taxonomies rather than a single taxonomy of items, which is the case in previous taxonomy-based method [7], [24].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, our method overcomes the sparsity problem, that occurs when applying SAs in CF, by utilizing the SAs/SCs assigned by users to items and their item classes.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This method computes the user similarity based on the ratings assigned by users to items and classes in a single taxonomy of items.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Linked Taxonomies was also more accurate than the RWR method.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The RWR method had a low recommendation accuracy because it does not use a taxonomy of SAs or a taxonomy of items, so it is affected severely by the sparsity problem when handling SAs.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The results obtained using RWR with the movie dataset indicate that the performance was better than that with the restaurant dataset, especially when there were many items in the recommendation list.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Furthermore, the movie dataset was sparser than the restaurant dataset, i.e., compare “ the average number of ratings assigned to items by users ” to “ the average number of ratings with SAs assigned to items by users ” in Table 1, Table 3.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Linked Taxonomies also improved MAP for the restaurant dataset compared with the movie dataset.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Based on these results, we can see that Linked Taxonomies improved the accuracy more when the dataset was sparser.</a>
