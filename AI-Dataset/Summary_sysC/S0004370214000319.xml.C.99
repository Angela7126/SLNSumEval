<a href="#0" id="0">In this section we propose a novel approach for the incremental computation of stable extensions of a modified framework {a mathematical formula}AF â€² , under the assumption that the preferred extensions of the original framework AF are available.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a first step, we prove in Proposition 2 that equality (3) holds for stable semantics.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, the splitting theorem (Theorem 2 of [12]) proves for stable, admissible, preferred, complete and grounded semantics, that combining extensions of the unaffected framework and of (the properly manipulated version of) the affected framework one gets global extensions and that every global extension gives rise to a local extension of the unaffected framework and (accordingly) to a local extension of (the properly manipulated version of) the affected framework.</a>
