<a href="#0" id="0">The FLP reduct of {a mathematical formula} Π 1 w.r.t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">I is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}f Π 2I and thus is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 2 under the FLP answer set semantics [4].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Consider the logic program {a mathematical formula} Π 2 in Example 2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For an interpretation I to be an answer set of a logic program Π , the FLP answer set semantics only requires I to be a minimal model of the FLP reduct {a mathematical formula}f Π I.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Consider {a mathematical formula} Π 2 in Example 2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then I is an answer set of Π if {a mathematical formula}lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )) ∪ ¬I − ⊨ A for every {a mathematical formula}A ∈ I.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In Example 2, {a mathematical formula}I={p( − 1),p(1)} is an FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 2 and {a mathematical formula}f Π 2I={r2,r3}.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Under the FLP answer set semantics, Π is identified with {a mathematical formula} Π ′ and I is an FLP answer set of Π if and only if it is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Consequently, I is both an FLP answer set of Π and of {a mathematical formula} Π ′ .Under the well-justified FLP answer set semantics, however, the two logic programs function rather differently.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This FLP answer set has a circular justification similar to that of {a mathematical formula} Π 2 in Example 2.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Consider again the logic program {a mathematical formula} Π 1 in Example 1.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">I is an FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 1, but it is not a well-justified FLP answer set.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">A Herbrand interpretation I is an FLP answer set of Π relative to L if I is a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}f Π LI.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">For the dl-program Π in Example 15, {a mathematical formula}I={p(a),q(a)} is not a well-justified FLP answer set.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Observe that when {a mathematical formula}I ˆ is an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ , I may not be an FLP or a well-justified FLP answer set of Π , and even not be a model of Π .</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Let {a mathematical formula}I ˆ be an answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π ˆ and I be its projection on Π .</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Consider the logic program {a mathematical formula} Π 1 from Example 1.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">From this and since every well-justified FLP answer of an arbitrary logic program Π is an FLP answer of Π (Corollary 2) and every FLP answer set of Π as a minimal model of {a mathematical formula}f Π I also must be a minimal model of Π , the second equivalence follows.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">( ⟹ ) Let I be an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set of Π with {a mathematical formula}l ∈ I.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">So I is also an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 1.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">( ⟸ ) Let {a mathematical formula} Π 1 have an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set I.</a>
<a href="#21" id="21">Since {a mathematical formula}f Π I=f Π 1I, I is also an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set of Π with {a mathematical formula}l ∈ I.</a>
<a href="#22" id="22">Therefore, if Π has no FLP or well-justified FLP answer set, then {a mathematical formula} Π 1 has no FLP or well-justified FLP answer set.</a>
<a href="#23" id="23">Thus, p trivially belongs to every FLP or well-justified FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 1.</a>
<a href="#24" id="24">Conversely, if p belongs to every FLP or well-justified FLP answer set of {a mathematical formula} Π 1, then {a mathematical formula} Π 1 must be inconsistent without FLP or well-justified FLP answer sets.</a>
<a href="#25" id="25">If Π has an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set I, then p belongs to the FLP or well-justified FLP answer set {a mathematical formula}I ∪ {p} of {a mathematical formula} Π 2.</a>
<a href="#26" id="26">Conversely, if p belongs to an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set I of {a mathematical formula} Π 2, then Π has an FLP or well-justified FLP answer set {a mathematical formula}I ∖ {p}.</a>
<a href="#27" id="27">Consequently, deciding whether Π has a well-justified FLP answer set is in {a mathematical formula}NPNEXP when L belongs to {a mathematical formula}SHOIN(D).</a>
<a href="#28" id="28">some) well-justified FLP answer set is {a mathematical formula}co-NEXP-complete (resp.</a>
<a href="#29" id="29">Since {a mathematical formula}I=lfp(Tf Π I( ∅ ,¬I − )), I is also a well-justified FLP answer set of Π .</a>
