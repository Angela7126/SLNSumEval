<a href="#0" id="0">The expected cost of the ith round is thus:{a mathematical formula} as it takes into account the cost of initiating the new search round and the expected cost of obtaining any possible number of agent values j{a mathematical formula}(0<j ⩽ N) in round i.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Accordingly, (4) can be understood differently by factoring the term {a mathematical formula}(1 − F(ri − 1))N into the remainder of the expression, resulting in the equation{a mathematical formula} Here, the first term is the expected contribution of the fixed cost of publishing the threshold to the total search cost, which is Α times the expected number of rounds.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the specific case in which the reservation values are chosen from a finite set of L values {a mathematical formula}{x1, … ,xL}, {a mathematical formula}xmin<xi<xi+1<xL=xmax for all i, the optimal strategy can be derived with the following dynamic programming formulation in {a mathematical formula}O(L2N) time:{a mathematical formula} Here, {a mathematical formula}C(l) is the cost of continuing the search if a search using reservation value {a mathematical formula}xl failed to obtain any applicable agent values.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A unique result of the above analysis is that the optimal increasing threshold search strategy can be expressed as a single value {a mathematical formula}0<P ⩽ 1, denoted the reservation probability.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since the optimal sequence is infinite and the expected cost from each round onwards is stationary, the expected cost of using P can be expressed with the following equation:{a mathematical formula} Here, the first term is the fixed cost per round, the second term is the expected cost of obtaining any values, and the last term is the expected cost of continuing the search if necessary.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In contrast to Proposition 1, Proposition 2 states that the optimal strategy when there is no cost for initiating a new search round ({a mathematical formula} Α =0) is to increment the reservation value by the smallest amount possible, such that the expected number of values obtained is minimized.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, Proposition 3 highlights how the tradeoff between obtaining a certain number of agents and continuing a search is affected by P in the case where the cost of obtaining the values of j agents is linear in j.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For large values of Α and all {a mathematical formula} Β (j) cost functions, the reservation probability is set such that the expected number of search rounds is close to 1 due to the substantial cost of initiating a new search round.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Accordingly, the initial state is {a mathematical formula}(xmin,0).</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">A search strategy is defined by a function {a mathematical formula}S:(r,k) → r ′ , {a mathematical formula}r ′ >r, in which {a mathematical formula}r ′ is the reservation value to use in a round with initial state {a mathematical formula}(r,k).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Since the reservation value {a mathematical formula}r ′ depends on the number of agents found so far, a search strategy cannot be defined a priori by a sequence of reservation values as in the case of a single-agent search.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">This result is in turn used to prove the inductive step, since the expected cost is independent of the actual sequence of reservation values.In the base cases, {a mathematical formula}Vk ′ =0 ∀ k ′ ⩾ K by definition, since the search is terminated in such cases.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">(11), we can formulate the expected cost of using this reservation probability as:{a mathematical formula} This expression is independent of any reservation values used during the search, thus completing the inductive step that shows that the expected cost of continuing the search from any state {a mathematical formula}(r,k) is some constant {a mathematical formula}Vk.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The expected cost of applying a strategy {a mathematical formula}S=[r1, … ,rm=xmax] is thus similar to (4), except that {a mathematical formula} Β (j) is replaced with the cost {a mathematical formula}V(j,ri − 1,ri) of conducting the optimal sequential economic search on j items whose values are between the last two reservation values used, {a mathematical formula}ri − 1 and {a mathematical formula}ri.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Whenever the ratio between the fixed cost of each search iteration and the cost of evaluating an agent ({a mathematical formula} Α / Β (1)) is sufficiently low, increasing threshold search results in a lower expected overall cost than sequential search.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">This is a result of the low search costs due to the low {a mathematical formula} Α / Β (1) ratio.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Finally, we note that the difference between the sequential search and the increasing threshold-limiting sequential search does not depend on the cost function {a mathematical formula} Β (j).</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The first term is the cost of sampling K elements; the next two terms are for the expected cost of performing a threshold search on the remaining {a mathematical formula}N − K elements; the fourth term is the expected value of the agent found if its value is below the search threshold r, which will be found either by the sample or the threshold search; and the fifth term is the expected value of the agent if its value is above r, in which case it is necessarily one of the K agents sampled.</a>
