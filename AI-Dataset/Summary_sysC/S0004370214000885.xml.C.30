<a href="#0" id="0">We prove that the coalitional manipulation problem is NP-complete under the Borda rule with two manipulators.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This settles an open problem in computational social choice.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also show that Baldwin's and Nanson's rules are NP-complete to manipulate even with a single manipulator.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For Baldwin's rule and weighted votes, the coalitional manipulation problem is NP-hard with three or more candidates.We reduce from the partition problem.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that the weighted coalitional manipulation problem under Nanson's rule is NP-complete with four or more candidates.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, if there are at most three candidates, the computational complexity of computing a manipulation under Nanson's rule is polynomial-time.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For Nanson's rule and weighted votes, the coalitional manipulation problem is NP-complete with four or more candidates.We reduce from partition.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For any partition instance, we construct a coalitional manipulation problem with four candidates (a, b, c, and p) where p is the candidate that the manipulators wish to win.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We transform a Borda manipulation problem with {a mathematical formula}m+1 candidates and 2 manipulators such that {a mathematical formula} ∑ i=1mg(i)=m(m − 1) to a PMRDS problem on an m by m matrix.</a>
