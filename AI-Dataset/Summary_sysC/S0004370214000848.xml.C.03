<a href="#0" id="0">If a goal state {a mathematical formula}sG ∈ G is reached, the problem finishes, i.e., no more actions need to be executed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A policy Π can also be classified according to {a mathematical formula}S Π and {a mathematical formula}R Π .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For any open policy Π , replanning has a nonzero probability of happening because every state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ R Π ∩ S Π has a nonzero probability of being reached when following Π from {a mathematical formula}s0.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, every open policy Π is also partial as Π is not defined over the states {a mathematical formula}s ∈ R Π ∩ S Π .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given a closed policy Π , {a mathematical formula}V Π (s) is the expected accumulated cost to reach a goal state from state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S Π .</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Another common assumption for SSPs is as follows: For every closed and improper policy Π , there exists at least one state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S Π such that {a mathematical formula}V Π (s) is infinite.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">a state {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S if, for all {a mathematical formula}s ′ ∈ R Π ∩ S Π , {a mathematical formula} Δ (s,s ′ ) ≥ t.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By the definition of {a mathematical formula}S Π , we have that all {a mathematical formula}s ′ ∈ S Π is reachable from {a mathematical formula}s0 when following Π .</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">s for {a mathematical formula}S, i.e., for all {a mathematical formula}s ′ ∈ R Π ∩ S Π , {a mathematical formula} Δ (s,s ′ ) ≥ t.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">By the definition of {a mathematical formula}Ss,t, for all {a mathematical formula}s ′ ∈ Ss,t, {a mathematical formula} Δ (s,s ′ ) ≤ t.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Because Assumption 1 holds for {a mathematical formula}S, we have that {a mathematical formula}V ⁎ (s)< ∞ for all {a mathematical formula}s ∈ S.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">SSiPP obtains the next state {a mathematical formula}s ′ from the current state s by either executing or sampling one outcome of the optimal policy {a mathematical formula} Π Ss,t ⁎ of the current short-sighted SSP (Algorithm 1 line 11).</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Given a state s, CheckSolved searches for states {a mathematical formula}s ′ reachable from s when following a greedy policy {a mathematical formula} Π V such that {a mathematical formula}R(s ′ ,V)> Ε .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">If no such state {a mathematical formula}s ′ is found, then s and all the states in {a mathematical formula}S Π V reachable from s have converged, and they are labeled as solved.</a>
