<a href="#0" id="0">In the max case, if the true value is at least V then we say Yes for some Ζ , and if the true value is less than V then {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I, Ζ )<v for all Ζ and therefore we always say No.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus the problem is in NP.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the min case, if the true value is at least V then all Ζ yield Yes, and if the true value is less than V then some Ζ yields No.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus the problem is in co-NP.For the inductive step assume that the claim holds for {a mathematical formula}k − 1 and consider the input {a mathematical formula}(B,I,V) with an interpretation I, value bound V and a max-k-alternating diagram {a mathematical formula}B=maxw1 ⁡ minw2 ⁡ … QwkAB(w1, … ,wk) where in order to simplify the notation each {a mathematical formula}wi may be a single variable or a set of variables and we use the boldface notation to denote this fact.Now for each tuple i of domain objects in I (which is appropriate for the number of variables in {a mathematical formula}w1) let diagram {a mathematical formula}B ′ be {a mathematical formula}B ′ =minw2 ⁡ … QwkAB(w1=i, … ,wk).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By the construction of B, in particular the order of equality blocks along paths in the GFODD, we have that the evaluation of the diagram on Ζ “ exits ” to a default value on the first violation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, if {a mathematical formula}Qj is a ∀ then {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I, Ζ )=1 and if {a mathematical formula}Qj is a ∃ then {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I, Ζ )=0.We can now show the correspondence in truth values.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The claim then follows because the prefix includes all variables and there is a 1 – 1 correspondence in truth values for substitutions in group 1.For the inductive step, the valuation v covers the first {a mathematical formula}j − 1 blocks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The two portions are put together so as to respect predicate order, and the final diagram {a mathematical formula}B1 is shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since Edge Removal is a special case of Equivalence it suffices to show membership for Equivalence and hardness for Edge Removal.To show membership we show that the complement, nonequivalence, is in {a mathematical formula} Σ k+1P.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Given two max-k-alternating GFODDs {a mathematical formula}B1 and {a mathematical formula}B2 as input, we guess an interpretation I of the appropriate size, and then appeal to an oracle for GFODD Evaluation to calculate {a mathematical formula}MAPB1(I) and {a mathematical formula}MAPB2(I).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">A legal interpretation embeds the binary interpretation {a mathematical formula}I ⁎ from the previous proof and in addition includes a truth setting for all the variables in the first ∀ block of the QBF.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The claim then follows because the prefix includes all variables and there is a 1 – 1 correspondence in truth values for substitutions in group 1.For the inductive step, the valuation v covers the first {a mathematical formula}j − 1 blocks.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">To implement this idea we need a few additional constructions.Let the set of variables in the first ∀ block of the QBF be {a mathematical formula}x1,x2, … ,x ℓ .</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The set of predicates in the extended reduction includes unary predicates {a mathematical formula}T(),y1(), {a mathematical formula}y2(),x1(),x2(), … ,x ℓ (), and one binary predicate {a mathematical formula}q( ⋅ , ⋅ ).</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">We conclude that the aggregated value for this prefix is 0.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Therefore, if {a mathematical formula}MAPB(I)=1 and thus the max aggregation over these prefix variables yields 1, it must be through the intended valuation {a mathematical formula} Ζ p for the prefix {a mathematical formula}T,y1,y2,x1, … ,x ℓ .However, when {a mathematical formula}T,y1,y2,x1, … ,x ℓ are fixed to their intended values, the portions of the diagram testing for {a mathematical formula} ≤ q+3 objects, the uniqueness of special objects {a mathematical formula}T,y1,y2,x1, … ,xk, the symmetry of {a mathematical formula}q() and its simulation of {a mathematical formula}PT() and {a mathematical formula}Pxi do not affect the final value in the sense that a valuation reaching them always continues to the next block.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">Therefore, if we restrict attention to such valuations we can shrink B by removing these blocks and still obtain the same aggregated value.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">For membership we get the bound on interpretation size by the assumption on the input; then the algorithm is the same.For the reduction, we use Theorem 1 to calculate {a mathematical formula}B=Apply(B1,B2,+).</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">As stated in that theorem, we can mesh together the aggregation lists of {a mathematical formula}B1 and {a mathematical formula}B2 interleaving the max and min blocks from each diagram without increasing quantifier depth and the diagram B has the same quantifier prefix and depth as those of {a mathematical formula}B1 and {a mathematical formula}B2.</a>
