<a href="#0" id="0">The status of the Erd Ő s discrepancy conjecture for {a mathematical formula}C=2 has been settled by the authors of this article [30], [31] by encoding the problem as a propositional satisfiability problem and using state of the art SAT solvers to prove that the longest ±1 sequence of discrepancy 2 contains 1160 elements.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A {a mathematical formula}13900 long ±1 sequence of discrepancy 3 was also constructed.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We say that a ±1 sequence {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xl is C-bounded, for some {a mathematical formula}C>0 if {a mathematical formula}| ∑ i=1jxi| ≤ C, for all {a mathematical formula}j:0<j ≤ l.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Notice that every ±1 sequence whose length does not exceed C is always C-bounded.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For any assignment{a mathematical formula}I:vars( Φ (p1, … ,pl)) → {0,1}such that I satisfies{a mathematical formula} Φ (p1, … ,pl), any{a mathematical formula}1 ≤ j ≤ land{a mathematical formula}1 ≤ k ≤ lwe have{a mathematical formula}</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For any assignment{a mathematical formula}I:{p1, … ,pn} → {0,1}the following holds: there exists an extension of I to{a mathematical formula}I ′ :vars(edp(C,n)) → {0,1}that is a model of{a mathematical formula}edp(C,n)if, and only if,{a mathematical formula}I(p1), … ,I(pn)encodes a ±1 sequence{a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xnof length n and discrepancy at most C.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For any assignment{a mathematical formula}I:{p1, … ,pn} → {0,1}the following holds: there exists an extension of I to{a mathematical formula}I ′ :vars(edpm(C,n)) → {0,1}(or an extension of I to{a mathematical formula}I ′ :vars(edpcm(C,n)) → {0,1}), which is a model of{a mathematical formula}edpm(C,n)(or{a mathematical formula}edpcm(C,n), respectively) if, and only if,{a mathematical formula}I(p1), … ,I(pn)encodes a multiplicative (or completely multiplicative, respectively) ±1 sequence{a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xnof length n and discrepancy at most C.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The completely multiplicative case can be further optimised based on the following observation.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The discrepancy of a completely multiplicative ±1 sequence{a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xnis bounded by C, for some{a mathematical formula}C>0, if, and only if,{a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xnis C-bounded.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally notice that the fact that {a mathematical formula}x1, … ,xn is multiplicative does not imply that {a mathematical formula} − x1, … , − xn is, so symmetry breaking described in Proposition 11 is not applicable for multiplicative and completely multiplicative sequences.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">So we get a computer-aided proof of another sharp bound on the sizes of maximal sequences of bounded discrepancy.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The length of a maximal multiplicative ±1 sequence of discrepancy 3 equals the length of a maximal completely multiplicative ±1 sequence of discrepancy 3 and is{a mathematical formula}127645.</a>
