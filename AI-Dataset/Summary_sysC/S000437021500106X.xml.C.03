<a href="#0" id="0">In this article we present a unified graph-based approach for measuring semantic similarity which enables effective comparison of linguistic items at multiple levels, from word senses to full texts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this article, we propose a unified approach to semantic similarity that can handle items from multiple linguistic levels, from sense to text pairs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our approach for measuring semantic similarity obtained state-of-the-art performance on several datasets pertaining to different linguistic levels.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Measuring the semantic similarity of pairs of linguistic items can be performed at different linguistic levels.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 1 lists example semantic similarity judgments for pairs belonging to each of these three linguistic levels.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">At the word level, semantic similarity usually corresponds to the similarity of the closest senses of the paired words [25].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The word is disambiguated by computing the semantic similarity between the context in which it appears, i.e., the definition of windmill{sup:1}n, and all the definitions of machine in Wiktionary (right side in Fig.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In Section 6.3.4 we present our experiments on utilizing the automatically-induced semantic networks in the task of word similarity measurement.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Once we have obtained the semantic signature representations for a pair of linguistic items, we can calculate the similarity of the two items by comparing their corresponding semantic signatures.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Measures for computing text semantic similarity often operate at the word surface level.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To this end, we propose an alignment-based Word Sense Disambiguation technique that leverages concepts' semantic signatures to disambiguate the content words in a linguistic item.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For a word {a mathematical formula}ti âˆˆ T1, the algorithm searches for a sense {a mathematical formula}best_sensei that produces the maximal similarity with a specific sense among all the senses of all the words in {a mathematical formula}T2.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In line 6, Senses(t) returns all senses of the word t and {a mathematical formula}R(sense1,sense2), on the next line, measures the similarity of sense1 and sense2 by leveraging our semantic similarity technique at the sense level.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Given a list of word pairs, the task is to automatically judge the semantic similarity between each pair.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">So far, the experiments we have reported in this article were those carried out to assess the performance of our system when measuring the semantic similarity of sense and word pairs.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">As we also described in our analysis in the word level, in the absence of the disambiguation step, a semantic signature is constructed by initializing the PPR algorithm from all nodes associated with all the senses of the content words in the linguistic item.</a>
