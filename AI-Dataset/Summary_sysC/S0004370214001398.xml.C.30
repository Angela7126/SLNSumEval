<a href="#1" id="1">We present a novel framework of anticipatory action selection for human – robot interaction, which is capable to handle nonlinear and stochastic human behaviors such as table tennis strokes and allows the robot to choose the optimal action based on prediction of the human partner's intention with uncertainty.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The presented framework is generic and can be used in many human – robot interaction scenarios, for example, in navigation and human – robot co-manipulation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this article, we conduct a case study on human – robot table tennis.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Due to the limited amount of time for executing hitting movements, a robot usually needs to initiate its hitting movement before the opponent hits the ball, which requires the robot to be anticipatory based on visual observation of the opponent's movement.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Previous work on Intention-Driven Dynamics Models (IDDM) allowed the robot to predict the intended target of the opponent.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this article, we address the problem of action selection and optimal timing for initiating a chosen action by formulating the anticipatory action selection as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the transition and observation are modeled by the IDDM framework.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We present two approaches to anticipatory action selection based on the POMDP formulation, i.e., a model-free policy learning method based on Least-Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) that employs the IDDM for belief updates, and a model-based Monte-Carlo Planning (MCP) method, which benefits from the transition and observation model by the IDDM.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To gain sufficient time for initializing and executing a hitting movement, the robot needs to be anticipatory about its human opponent's intention, which human players rely heavily on [2].</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The prediction of the human partner's intention can be realized by modeling how the intention directs the dynamics of hitting movement [53].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the table tennis scenario, this Intention-Driven Dynamics Model (IDDM) leads to an online algorithm that, given a time series of observations, continually predicts the human player's intended target, i.e., where the human intends to shoot the ball [53], as shown in Fig.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example in the case of human – robot table tennis, the robot's hitting point can usually be precisely predicted 120 ms after the human player hits the ball [53], and, thus, an optimal policy would stop waiting and initiate a hitting movement.</a>
