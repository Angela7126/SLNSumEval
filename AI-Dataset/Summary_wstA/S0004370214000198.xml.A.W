<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we propose an approach to multi-source belief revision where the trust or credibility assigned to informant agents can be revised.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In our proposal, the credibility of each informant represented as a strict partial order among informant agents, will be maintained in a repository called credibility base.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Upon arrival of new information concerning the credibility of its peers, an agent will be capable of revising this strict partial order, changing the trust assigned to its peers accordingly.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our goal is to formalize a set of change operators over the credibility base: expansion, contraction, prioritized, and non-prioritized revision.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These operators will provide the capability of dynamically modifying the credibility of informants considering the reliability of the information.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This dynamics will reflect a new perception of trust assigned to the informant, or extend the set of informants by admitting the addition of new informant agents.</a>
