<a href="#0" id="0">Strong equivalence is an important concept in the theory of answer set programming.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Informally speaking, two sets of rules are strongly equivalent if they have the same meaning in any context.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Equilibrium logic was used to prove that sets of rules expressed as propositional formulas are strongly equivalent if and only if they are equivalent in the logic of here-and-there.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We extend this line of work to formulas with infinitely long conjunctions and disjunctions, show that the infinitary logic of here-and-there characterizes strong equivalence of infinitary formulas, and give an axiomatization of that logic.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is useful because of the relationship between infinitary formulas and logic programs with local variables.</a>
