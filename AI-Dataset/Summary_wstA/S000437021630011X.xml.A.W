<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we consider an extended variant of query learning where the hidden concept is embedded in some Boolean circuit.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This additional processing layer modifies query arguments and answers by fixed transformation functions which are known to the learner.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For this scenario, we provide a characterization of the solution space and an ordering on it.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We give a compact representation of the minimal and maximal solutions as quantified Boolean formulas and we adapt the original algorithms for exact learning of specific classes of propositional formulas.</a>
