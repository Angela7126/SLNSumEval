<a href="#0" id="0">Integer Linear Programming (ILP) can be seen as the archetypical problem for NP-complete optimization problems, and a wide range of problems in artificial intelligence are solved in practice via a translation to ILP.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Despite its huge range of applications, only few tractable fragments of ILP are known, probably the most prominent of which is based on the notion of total unimodularity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Using entirely different techniques, we identify new tractable fragments of ILP by studying structural parameterizations of the constraint matrix within the framework of parameterized complexity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular, we show that ILP is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the treedepth of the constraint matrix and the maximum absolute value of any coefficient occurring in the ILP instance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Together with matching hardness results for the more general parameter treewidth, we give an overview of the complexity of ILP w.r.t.</a>
