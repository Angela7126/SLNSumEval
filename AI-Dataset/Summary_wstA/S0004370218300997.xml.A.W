<a href="#0" id="0">Extending qualitative CSPs with the ability of restricting selected variables to finite sets of possible values has been proposed as an interesting research direction with important applications, cf.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">“Qualitative constraint satisfaction problems: an extended framework with landmarks” by Li, Liu, and Wang (2013) [48].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Previously presented complexity results for this kind of extended formalisms have typically focused on concrete examples and not on general principles.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We propose three general methods.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first two methods are based on analysing the given CSP from a model-theoretical perspective, while the third method is based on directly analysing the growth of the representation of solutions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We exemplify the methods on temporal and spatial formalisms including Allen's algebra and RCC-5.</a>
