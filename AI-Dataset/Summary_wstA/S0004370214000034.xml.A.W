<a href="#0" id="0">Networks of ontologies are made of a collection of logic theories, called ontologies, related by alignments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">They arise naturally in distributed contexts in which theories are developed and maintained independently, such as the semantic web.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In networks of ontologies, inconsistency can come from two different sources: local inconsistency in a particular ontology or alignment, and global inconsistency between them.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Belief revision is well-defined for dealing with ontologies; we investigate how it can apply to networks of ontologies.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We formulate revision postulates for alignments and networks of ontologies based on an abstraction of existing semantics of networks of ontologies.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We show that revision operators cannot be simply based on local revision operators on both ontologies and alignments.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We adapt the partial meet revision framework to networks of ontologies and show that it indeed satisfies the revision postulates.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, we consider strategies based on network characteristics for designing concrete revision operators.</a>
