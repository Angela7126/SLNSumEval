<a href="#0" id="0">In everyday life, people make use of theory of mind by explicitly attributing unobservable mental content such as beliefs, desires, and intentions to others.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Humans are known to be able to use this ability recursively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is, they engage in higher-order theory of mind, and consider what others believe about their own beliefs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we use agent-based computational models to investigate the evolution of higher-order theory of mind.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We consider higher-order theory of mind across four different competitive games, including repeated single-shot and repeated extensive form games, and determine the advantage of higher-order theory of mind agents over their lower-order theory of mind opponents.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Across these four games, we find a common pattern in which first-order and second-order theory of mind agents clearly outperform opponents that are more limited in their ability to make use of theory of mind, while the advantage for deeper recursion to third-order theory of mind is limited in comparison.</a>
