<a href="#0" id="0">Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are increasingly popular approaches to multi-objective optimization.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">One of their significant advantages is that they can directly optimize the Pareto front by evolving a population of solutions, where the recombination (also called crossover) operators are usually employed to reproduce new and potentially better solutions by mixing up solutions in the population.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Recombination in multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is, however, mostly applied heuristically.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we investigate how from a theoretical viewpoint a recombination operator will affect a multi-objective EA.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, we employ artificial benchmark problems: the Weighted LPTNO problem (a generalization of the well-studied LOTZ problem), and the well-studied COCZ problem, for studying the effect of recombination.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our analysis discloses that recombination may accelerate the filling of the Pareto front by recombining diverse solutions and thus help solve multi-objective optimization.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Because of this, for these two problems, we find that a multi-objective EA with recombination enabled achieves a better expected running time than any known EAs with recombination disabled.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We further examine the effect of recombination on solving the multi-objective minimum spanning tree problem, which is an NP-hard problem.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Following our finding on the artificial problems, our analysis shows that recombination also helps accelerate filling the Pareto front and thus helps find approximate solutions faster.</a>
