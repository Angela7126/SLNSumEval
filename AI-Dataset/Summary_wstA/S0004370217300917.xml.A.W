<a href="#0" id="0">We consider problems in which several individuals each need to make a yes/no choice regarding a number of issues and these choices then need to be aggregated into a collective choice.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Depending on the application at hand, different combinations of yes/no may be considered rational.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We describe rationality assumptions as integrity constraints using a simple propositional language and we explore the question of whether or not a given aggregation procedure will lift a given integrity constraint from the individual to the collective level, i.e., whether the collective choice will be rational whenever all individual choices are.</a>
