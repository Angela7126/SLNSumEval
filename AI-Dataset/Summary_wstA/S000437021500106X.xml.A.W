<a href="#0" id="0">In 1930s Paul Erdős conjectured that for any positive integer C in any infinite ±1 sequence (xn) there exists a subsequence xd,x2d,x3d,…,xkd, for some positive integers k and d, such that |∑i=1kxi⋅d|>C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The conjecture has been referred to as one of the major open problems in combinatorial number theory and discrepancy theory.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the particular case of C=1 a human proof of the conjecture exists; for C=2 a bespoke computer program had generated sequences of length 1124 of discrepancy 2, but the status of the conjecture remained open even for such a small bound.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We show that by encoding the problem into Boolean satisfiability and applying the state of the art SAT solvers, one can obtain a discrepancy 2 sequence of length 1160 and a proof of the Erdős discrepancy conjecture for C=2, claiming that no discrepancy 2 sequence of length 1161, or more, exists.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the similar way, we obtain a precise bound of 127 645 on the maximal lengths of both multiplicative and completely multiplicative sequences of discrepancy 3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also demonstrate that unrestricted discrepancy 3 sequences can be longer than 130 000.</a>
