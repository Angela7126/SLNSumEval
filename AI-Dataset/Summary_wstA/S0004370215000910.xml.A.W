<a href="#0" id="0">Bayesian networks are a commonly used method of representing conditional probability relationships between a set of variables in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Determination of the DAG which best explains observed data is an NP-hard problem [1].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This problem can be stated as a constrained optimisation problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This paper explores how the performance of ILP-based Bayesian network learning can be improved through ILP techniques and in particular through the addition of non-essential, implied constraints.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">There are exponentially many such constraints that can be added to the problem.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This paper explores how these constraints may best be generated and added as needed.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The results show that using these constraints in the best discovered configuration can lead to a significant improvement in performance and show significant improvement in speed using a state-of-the-art Bayesian network structure learner.</a>
