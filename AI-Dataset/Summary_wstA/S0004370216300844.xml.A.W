<a href="#0" id="0">Autonomous robots facing a diversity of open environments and performing a variety of tasks and interactions need explicit deliberation in order to fulfill their missions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Deliberation is meant to endow a robotic system with extended, more adaptable and robust functionalities, as well as reduce its deployment cost.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The ambition of this survey is to present a global overview of deliberation functions in robotics and to discuss the state of the art in this area.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The following five deliberation functions are identified and analyzed: planning, acting, monitoring, observing, and learning.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The paper introduces a global perspective on these deliberation functions and discusses their main characteristics, design choices and constraints.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The reviewed contributions are discussed with respect to this perspective.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The survey focuses as much as possible on papers with a clear robotics content and with a concern on integrating several deliberation functions.</a>
