<a href="#0" id="0">Within the last decade, abstract argumentation has emerged as a central field in Artificial Intelligence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Besides providing a core formalism for many advanced argumentation systems, abstract argumentation has also served to capture several non-monotonic logics and other AI related principles.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Although the idea of abstract argumentation is appealingly simple, several reasoning problems in this formalism exhibit high computational complexity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This calls for advanced techniques when it comes to implementation issues, a challenge which has been recently faced from different angles.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this survey, we give an overview on different methods for solving reasoning problems in abstract argumentation and compare their particular features.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Moreover, we highlight available state-of-the-art systems for abstract argumentation, which put these methods to practice.</a>
