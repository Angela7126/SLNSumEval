<a href="#0" id="0">The science of AI is concerned with the study of intelligent forms of behaviour in computational terms.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">But what does it tell us when a good semblance of a behaviour can be achieved using cheap tricks that seem to have little to do with what we intuitively imagine intelligence to be?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Are these intuitions wrong, and is intelligence really just a bag of tricks?</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Or are the philosophers right, and is a behavioural understanding of intelligence simply too weak?</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">I think both of these are wrong.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">I suggest in the context of question-answering that what matters when it comes to the science of AI is not a good semblance of intelligent behaviour at all, but the behaviour itself, what it depends on, and how it can be achieved.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">I go on to discuss two major hurdles that I believe will need to be cleared.</a>
