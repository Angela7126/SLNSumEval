<a href="#0" id="0">This research note provides novel results concerning the incremental computation of the stable and ideal argumentation semantics, by extending the division-based method presented in [1] and correcting a flawed claim given there.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a basis for these results, the note synthetically reviews and discusses the topology-related properties of directionality and SCC-recursiveness in abstract argumentation semantics and analyzes their relationships with the division-based method.</a>
