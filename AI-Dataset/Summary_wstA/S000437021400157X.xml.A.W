<a href="#1" id="1">The simple version of the public goods game (PGG) has a fixed utility for a player who has at least a single neighbor buying the good.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Players in the general version of PGG have additional utility when multiple neighbors purchase the good.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The general version of the public goods game is shown to be a potential game, establishing the convergence to a stable state (i.e., a pure Nash equilibrium – PNE) by best-response dynamics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One can think of best-response dynamics as a distributed algorithm that runs in a fixed order of players/agents and is guaranteed to converge to a PNE.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">A new distributed algorithm is proposed for finding PNEs with improved efficiency by the use of transfer of payoffs among players.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For the simple version of PGG, it is shown that the proposed algorithm can stabilize an outcome that maximizes social welfare.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the general version of the game, the proposed procedure transforms any initial outcome into a stable solution at least as efficient as the initial outcome by using transfers.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">An extensive experimental evaluation on randomly generated PGGs demonstrates that whereas pure best-response dynamics converges on stable states that have lower efficiency than the initial outcome, the proposed procedure finds PNEs of higher efficiency.</a>
