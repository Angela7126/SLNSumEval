<a href="#0" id="0">Many state-of-the-art evolutionary vector optimization algorithms compute the contributing hypervolume for ranking candidate solutions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, with an increasing number of objectives, calculating the volumes becomes intractable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, although hypervolume-based algorithms are often the method of choice for bi-criteria optimization, they are regarded as not suitable for many-objective optimization.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Recently, Monte Carlo methods have been derived and analyzed for approximating the contributing hypervolume.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Turning theory into practice, we employ these results in the ranking procedure of the multi-objective covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (MO-CMA-ES) as an example of a state-of-the-art method for vector optimization.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It is empirically shown that the approximation does not impair the quality of the obtained solutions given a budget of objective function evaluations, while considerably reducing the computation time in the case of multiple objectives.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These results are obtained on common benchmark functions as well as on two design optimization tasks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, employing Monte Carlo approximations makes hypervolume-based algorithms applicable to many-objective optimization.</a>
