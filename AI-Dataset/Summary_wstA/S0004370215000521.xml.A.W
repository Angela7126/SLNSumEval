<a href="#0" id="0">Time series interpretation aims to provide an explanation of what is observed in terms of its underlying processes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The present work is based on the assumption that the common classification-based approaches to time series interpretation suffer from a set of inherent weaknesses, whose ultimate cause lies in the monotonic nature of the deductive reasoning paradigm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this document we propose a new approach to this problem, based on the initial hypothesis that abductive reasoning properly accounts for the human ability to identify and characterize the patterns appearing in a time series.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The result of this interpretation is a set of conjectures in the form of observations, organized into an abstraction hierarchy and explaining what has been observed.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A knowledge-based framework and a set of algorithms for the interpretation task are provided, implementing a hypothesize-and-test cycle guided by an attentional mechanism.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As a representative application domain, interpretation of the electrocardiogram allows us to highlight the strengths of the proposed approach in comparison with traditional classification-based approaches.</a>
