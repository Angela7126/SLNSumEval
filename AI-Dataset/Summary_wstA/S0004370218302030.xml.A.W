<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper,1 we investigate bounded action theories in the situation calculus.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A bounded action theory is one which entails that, in every situation, the number of object tuples in the extension of fluents is bounded by a given constant, although such extensions are in general different across the infinitely many situations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We argue that such theories are common in applications, either because facts do not persist indefinitely or because the agent eventually forgets some facts, as new ones are learned.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We discuss various classes of bounded action theories.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then we show that verification of a powerful first-order variant of the Î¼-calculus is decidable for such theories.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Notably, this variant supports a controlled form of quantification across situations.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also show that through verification, we can actually check whether an arbitrary action theory maintains boundedness.</a>
