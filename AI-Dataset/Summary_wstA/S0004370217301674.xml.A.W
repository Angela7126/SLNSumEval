<a href="#0" id="0">With the aim of studying social properties of belief merging and having a better understanding of impossibility, we extend in three ways the framework of logic-based merging introduced by Konieczny and Pino PÃ©rez.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">First, at the level of representation of the information, we pass from belief bases to complex epistemic states.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Second, the profiles are represented as functions of finite societies to the set of epistemic states (a sort of vectors) and not as multisets of epistemic states.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Third, we extend the set of rational postulates in order to consider the epistemic versions of the classical postulates of social choice theory: standard domain, Pareto property, independence of irrelevant alternatives and absence of dictator.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These epistemic versions of social postulates are given, essentially, in terms of the finite propositional logic.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We state some representation theorems for these operators.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These extensions and representation theorems allow us to establish an epistemic and very general version of Arrow's impossibility theorem.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">One of the interesting features of our result, is that it holds for different representations of epistemic states; for instance conditionals, ordinal conditional functions and, of course, total preorders.</a>
