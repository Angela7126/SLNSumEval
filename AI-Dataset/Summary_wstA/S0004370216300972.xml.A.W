<a href="#0" id="0">Many modern applications of description logics (DLs, for short), such as biomedical ontologies and semantic web policies, provide fresh motivations for extending DLs with nonmonotonic inferencesâ€”a topic that has attracted a significant amount of attention along the years.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Despite this, nonmonotonic inferences are not yet supported by DL technology due to a number of issues related to expressiveness, computational complexity, and optimizations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This paper contributes to the practical support of nonmonotonic inferences in description logics by introducing a new semantics expressly designed to address knowledge engineering needs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This formalism has appealing expressiveness, enjoys nice computational properties, and constitutes an interesting solution to an ample class of application needs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The formalism is validated through extensive comparison with the other nonmonotonic DLs, and systematic scalability tests.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The test case generator and its novel validation methodology constitute a further contribution of this paper.</a>
