<a href="#0" id="0">Propositional Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are routinely used for solving many function problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A natural question that has seldom been addressed is: what is the number of calls to a SAT solver for solving some target function problem?</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This article improves upper bounds on the query complexity of solving several function problems defined on propositional formulas.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These include computing the backbone of a formula and computing the set of independent variables of a formula.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For the general case of monotone predicates, the article improves upper bounds on the query complexity of computing a minimal set when the number of minimal sets is constant.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This applies for example to the computation of a minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS) for CNF formulas, but also to the computation of prime implicants and implicates, with immediate application in a number of AI settings.</a>
