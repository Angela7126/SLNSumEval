<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we adopt a cooperative game theoretic approach in order to tackle the social ridesharing (SR) problem, where a set of commuters, connected through a social network, form coalitions and arrange one-time rides at short notice.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, we address two fundamental aspects of this problem.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, we focus on the optimisation problem of forming the travellers' coalitions that minimise the travel cost of the overall system.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To this end, we model the formation problem as a Graph-Constrained Coalition Formation (GCCF) one, where the set of feasible coalitions is restricted by a graph (i.e., the social network).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our approach allows users to specify both spatial and temporal preferences for the trips.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Second, we tackle the payment allocation aspect of SR, by proposing the first approach that computes kernel-stable payments for systems with thousands of agents.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We conduct a systematic empirical evaluation that uses real-world datasets (i.e., GeoLife and Twitter).</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We are able to compute optimal solutions for medium-sized systems (i.e., with 100 agents), and high quality solutions for very large systems (i.e., up to 2000 agents).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our results show that our approach improves the social welfare (i.e., reduces travel costs) by up to 36.22% with respect to the scenario with no ridesharing.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, our payment allocation method computes kernel-stable payments for 2000 agents in less than an hourâ€”while the state of the art is able to compute payments only for up to 100 agents, and does so 84 times slower than our approach.</a>
