<a href="#0" id="0">AUC is an important performance measure that has been used in diverse tasks, such as class-imbalanced learning, cost-sensitive learning, learning to rank, etc.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this work, we focus on one-pass AUC optimization that requires going through training data only once without having to store the entire training dataset.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Conventional online learning algorithms cannot be applied directly to one-pass AUC optimization because AUC is measured by a sum of losses defined over pairs of instances from different classes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We develop a regression-based algorithm which only needs to maintain the first and second-order statistics of training data in memory, resulting in a storage requirement independent of the number of training data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To efficiently handle high-dimensional data, we develop two deterministic algorithms that approximate the covariance matrices.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</a>
