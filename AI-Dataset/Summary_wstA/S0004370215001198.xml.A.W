<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we provide a semantic reconstruction of rational closure.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first consider rational closure as defined by Lehman and Magidor [33] for propositional logic, and we provide a semantic characterization based on a minimal models mechanism on rational models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then we extend the whole formalism and semantics to Description Logics, by focusing our attention to the standard ALC: we first naturally adapt to Description Logics Lehman and Magidor's propositional rational closure, starting from an extension of ALC with a typicality operator T that selects the most typical instances of a concept C (hence T(C) stands for typical C).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then, for the Description Logics, we define a minimal model semantics for the logic ALC and we show that it provides a semantic characterization for the rational closure of a Knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We consider both the rational closure of the TBox and the rational closure of the ABox.</a>
