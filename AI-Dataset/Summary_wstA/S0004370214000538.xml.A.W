<a href="#0" id="0">RCC8 is a popular fragment of the region connection calculus, in which qualitative spatial relations between regions, such as adjacency, overlap and parthood, can be expressed.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">While RCC8 is essentially dimensionless, most current applications are confined to reasoning about two-dimensional or three-dimensional physical space.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, however, we are mainly interested in conceptual spaces, which typically are high-dimensional Euclidean spaces in which the meaning of natural language concepts can be represented using convex regions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The aim of this paper is to analyze how the restriction to convex regions constrains the realizability of networks of RCC8 relations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, we identify all ways in which the set of RCC8 base relations can be restricted to guarantee that consistent networks can be convexly realized in respectively 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Most surprisingly, we find that if the relation ‘partially overlaps’ is disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 networks can be convexly realized in 4D.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">If instead refinements of the relation ‘part of’ are disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 relations can be convexly realized in 3D.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We furthermore show, among others, that any consistent RCC8 network with 2n+1 variables can be realized using convex regions in the n-dimensional Euclidean space.</a>
