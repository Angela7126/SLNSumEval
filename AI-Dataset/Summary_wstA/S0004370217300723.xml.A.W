<a href="#0" id="0">This paper presents two new search algorithms: Potential Search (PTS) and Anytime Potential Search/Anytime Non-Parametric A⁎ ( APTS/ANA⁎).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Both algorithms are based on a new evaluation function that is easy to implement and does not require user-tuned parameters.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">PTS is designed to solve bounded-cost search problems, which are problems where the task is to find as fast as possible a solution under a given cost bound.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">APTS/ANA⁎ is a non-parametric anytime search algorithm discovered independently by two research groups via two very different derivations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, co-authored by researchers from both groups, we present these derivations: as a sequence of calls to PTS and as a non-parametric greedy variant of Anytime Repairing A⁎.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We describe experiments that evaluate the new algorithms in the 15-puzzle, KPP-COM, robot motion planning, gridworld navigation, and multiple sequence alignment search domains.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our results suggest that when compared with previous anytime algorithms, APTS/ANA⁎: (1) does not require user-set parameters, (2) finds an initial solution faster, (3) spends less time between solution improvements, (4) decreases the suboptimality bound of the current-best solution more gradually, and (5) converges faster to an optimal solution when reachable.</a>
