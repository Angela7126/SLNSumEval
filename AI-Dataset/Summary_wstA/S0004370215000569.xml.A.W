<a href="#0" id="0">Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has produced many breakthroughs in search-based decision-making in games and other domains.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">There exist many general-purpose enhancements for MCTS, which improve its efficiency and effectiveness by learning information from one part of the search space and using it to guide the search in other parts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We introduce the Information Capture And ReUse Strategy (ICARUS) framework for describing and combining such enhancements.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We demonstrate the ICARUS framework's usefulness as a frame of reference for understanding existing enhancements, combining them, and designing new ones.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also use ICARUS to adapt some well-known MCTS enhancements (originally designed for games of perfect information) to handle information asymmetry between players and randomness, features which can make decision-making much more difficult.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also introduce a new enhancement designed within the ICARUS framework, EPisodic Information Capture and reuse (EPIC), designed to exploit the episodic nature of many games.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Empirically we demonstrate that EPIC is stronger and more robust than existing enhancements in a variety of game domains, thus validating ICARUS as a powerful tool for enhancement design within MCTS.</a>
