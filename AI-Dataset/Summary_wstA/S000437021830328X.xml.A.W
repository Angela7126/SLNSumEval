<a href="#0" id="0">We propose Diffusion Centrality (DC) in which semantic aspects of a social network are used to characterize vertices that are influential in diffusing a property p. In contrast to classical centrality measures, diffusion centrality of vertices varies with the property p, and depends on the diffusion model describing how p spreads.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show that DC applies to most known diffusion models including tipping, cascade, and homophilic models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We present a hypergraph-based algorithm (HyperDC) with many optimizations to exactly compute DC.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, HyperDC does not scale well to huge social networks (millions of vertices, tens of millions of edges).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For scaling, we develop methods to coarsen a network and propose a heuristic algorithm called “Coarsened Back and Forth” (CBAF) to compute the top-k vertices (having the highest diffusion centrality).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We report on experiments comparing DC with classical centrality measures in terms of runtime and the “spread” achieved by the k most central vertices (using 7 real-world social networks and 3 different diffusion models).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our experiments show that DC produces higher quality results and is comparable to several centrality measures in terms of runtime.</a>
