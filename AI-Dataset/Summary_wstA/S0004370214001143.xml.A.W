<a href="#0" id="0">Betweenness centrality measures the ability of different nodes to control the flow of information in a network.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this article, we extend the standard definition of betweenness centrality using Semivaluesâ€”a family of solution concepts from cooperative game theory that includes, among others, the Shapley value and the Banzhaf power index.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Any Semivalue-based betweenness centrality measure (such as, for example, the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure) has the advantage of evaluating the importance of individual nodes by considering the roles they each play in different groups of nodes.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our key result is the development of a general polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Semivalue-based betweenness centrality measure, and an even faster algorithm to compute the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure, both for weighted and unweighted networks.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Interestingly, for the unweighted case, our algorithm for computing the Shapley value-based centrality has the same complexity as the best known algorithm for computing the standard betweenness centrality due to Brandes [15].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We empirically evaluate our measures in a simulated scenario where nodes fail simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We show that, compared to the standard measure, the ranking obtained by our measures reflects more accurately the influence that different nodes have on the functionality of the network.</a>
