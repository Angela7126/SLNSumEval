<a href="#0" id="0">The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a widely studied problem with numerous applications in computer science and artificial intelligence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For infinite-domain CSPs, there are many results separating tractable and NP-hard cases while upper and lower bounds on the time complexity of hard cases are virtually unexplored.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Hence, we initiate a study of the worst-case time complexity of such CSPs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We analyze backtracking algorithms and determine upper bounds on their time complexity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We present asymptotically faster algorithms based on enumeration techniques and we show that these algorithms are applicable to well-studied problems in, for instance, temporal reasoning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, we prove non-trivial lower bounds applicable to many interesting CSPs, under the assumption that certain complexity-theoretic assumptions hold.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The gap between upper and lower bounds is in many cases surprisingly small, which suggests that our upper bounds cannot be significantly improved.</a>
