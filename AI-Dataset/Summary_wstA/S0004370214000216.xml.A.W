<a href="#0" id="0">In order to robustly perform tasks based on abstract instructions, robots need sophisticated knowledge processing methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These methods have to supply the difference between the (often shallow and symbolic) information in the instructions and the (detailed, grounded and often real-valued) information needed for execution.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For filling these information gaps, a robot first has to identify them in the instructions, reason about suitable information sources, and combine pieces of information from different sources and of different structure into a coherent knowledge base.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To this end we propose the KnowRob knowledge processing system for robots.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this article, we discuss why the requirements of a robot knowledge processing system differ from what is commonly investigated in AI research, and propose to re-consider a KR system as a semantically annotated view on information and algorithms that are often already available as part of the robot's control system.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We then introduce representational structures and a common vocabulary for representing knowledge about robot actions, events, objects, environments, and the robot's hardware as well as inference procedures that operate on this common representation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The KnowRob system has been released as open-source software and is being used on several robots performing complex object manipulation tasks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We evaluate it through prototypical queries that demonstrate the expressive power and its impact on the robot's performance.</a>
