<a href="#0" id="0">In scientific computing and in realistic graphic animation, simulation – that is, step-by-step calculation of the complete trajectory of a physical system – is one of the most common and important modes of calculation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this article, we address the scope and limits of the use of simulation, with respect to AI tasks that involve high-level physical reasoning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We argue that, in many cases, simulation can play at most a limited role.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Simulation is most effective when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of scales involved, both temporal and spatial, is not extreme.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When these conditions do not hold, simulation is less effective or entirely inappropriate.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We discuss twelve features of physical reasoning problems that pose challenges for simulation-based reasoning.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We briefly survey alternative techniques for physical reasoning that do not rely on simulation.</a>
