<a href="#0" id="0">Over the last few years, much progress has been made in the theory and practice of solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Novel solvers have been presented that either successfully enhance established techniques or implement novel solving paradigms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Powerful preprocessors have been realized that tune the encoding of a formula to make it easier to solve.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Frameworks for certification and solution extraction emerged that allow for a detailed interpretation of a QBF solver's results, and new types of QBF encodings were presented for various application problems.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To capture these developments the QBF Gallery was established in 2013.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The QBF Gallery aims at providing a forum to assess QBF tools and to collect new, expressive benchmarks that allow for documenting the status quo and that indicate promising research directions.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">These benchmarks became the basis for the experiments conducted in the context of the QBF Gallery 2013 and follow-up evaluations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this paper, we report on the setup of the QBF Gallery.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To this end, we conducted numerous experiments which allowed us not only to assess the quality of the tools, but also the quality of the benchmarks.</a>
