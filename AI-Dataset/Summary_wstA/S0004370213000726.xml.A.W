<a href="#0" id="0">We describe a planning algorithm, NDP2, that finds strong-cyclic solutions to nondeterministic planning problems by using a classical planner to solve a sequence of classical planning problems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">NDP2 is provably correct, and fixes several problems with prior work.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also describe two preprocessing algorithms that can provide a restricted version of the symbolic abstraction capabilities of the well-known MBP planner.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The preprocessing algorithms accomplish this by rewriting the planning problems, hence do not require any modifications to NDP2 or its classical planner.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In our experimental comparisons of NDP2 (using FF as the classical planner) to MBP in six different planning domains, each planner outperformed the other in some domains but not others.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Which planner did better depended on three things: the amount of nondeterminism in the planning domain, domain characteristics that affected how well the abstraction techniques worked, and whether the domain contained unsolvable states.</a>
