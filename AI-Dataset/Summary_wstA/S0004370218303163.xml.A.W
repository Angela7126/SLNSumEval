<a href="#0" id="0">We introduce the structural interface algorithm for exact probabilistic inference in Dynamic Bayesian Networks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It unifies state-of-the-art techniques for inference in static and dynamic networks, by combining principles of knowledge compilation with the interface algorithm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The resulting algorithm not only exploits the repeated structure in the network, but also the local structure, including determinism, parameter equality and context-specific independence.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Empirically, we show that the structural interface algorithm speeds up inference in the presence of local structure, and scales to larger and more complex networks.</a>
