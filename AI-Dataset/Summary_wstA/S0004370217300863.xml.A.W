<a href="#0" id="0">We present the first model of optimal voting under adversarial noise.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">From this viewpoint, voting rules are seen as error-correcting codes: their goal is to correct errors in the input rankings and recover a ranking that is close to the ground truth.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We derive worst-case bounds on the relation between the average accuracy of the input votes, and the accuracy of the output ranking.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Empirical results from real data show that our approach produces significantly more accurate rankings than alternative approaches.</a>
