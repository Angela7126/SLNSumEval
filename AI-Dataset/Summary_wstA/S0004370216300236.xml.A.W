<a href="#0" id="0">In this article, we define and study the problem of exchanging knowledge between a source and a target knowledge base (KB), connected through mappings.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Differently from the traditional database exchange setting, which considers only the exchange of data, we are interested in exchanging implicit knowledge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As representation formalism we use Description Logics (DLs), thus assuming that the source and target KBs are given as a DL TBox+ABox, while the mappings have the form of DL TBox assertions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We define a general framework of KB exchange, and study the problem of translating the knowledge in the source KB according to the mappings expressed in OWL 2 QL, the profile of the standard Web Ontology Language OWL 2 based on the description logic DL-LiteR.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We develop novel game- and automata-theoretic techniques, and we provide complexity results that range from NLogSpace to ExpTime.</a>
