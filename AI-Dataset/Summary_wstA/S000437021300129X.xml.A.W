<a href="#0" id="0">Feature terms are a generalization of first-order terms which have recently received increased attention for their usefulness in structured machine learning, natural language processing and other artificial intelligence applications.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">One of the main obstacles for their wide usage is that, when set-valued features are allowed, their basic operations (subsumption, unification, and antiunification) have a very high computational cost.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We present a Constraint Programming formulation of these operations, which in some cases provides orders of magnitude speed-ups with respect to the standard approaches.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition, exploiting several symmetries – that often appear in feature terms databases – causes substantial additional savings.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We provide experimental results of the benefits of this approach.</a>
