<a href="#0" id="0">Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving is one of the most competitive research areas of theoretical computer science.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The performance of state-of-the-art SAT solvers has been continuously improving in the last decades and has reached a level where SAT solvers can be employed to solve real world problems in fields such as hardware and software verification, automated planning and many others.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One of the important driving forces of this progress are the yearly organized (since 2002) SAT competitions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper we describe the 2015 SAT Race that featured the traditional sequential and parallel tracks (with 64 core computers) and introduced the Incremental Library Track, which is particularly interesting for developers of SAT based applications.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We describe the 2015 SAT Race and provide a detailed analysis of its results.</a>
