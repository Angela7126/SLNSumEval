<a href="#1" id="1">Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), recognized as one of the most important quantities in understanding and predicting the Earth's climate, is estimated daily on a global scale by several Earth-observing satellite instruments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each instrument has different coverage and sensitivity to atmospheric and surface conditions, and, as a result, the quality of AOD estimated by different instruments varies across the globe.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We present a semi-supervised method for learning how to aggregate estimations from multiple satellite instruments into a more accurate estimate, where labels come from a small number of accurate and expensive ground-based instruments.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The method also accounts for the problem of missing experts, an issue inherent to the AOD estimation task.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By assuming a context-dependent prior, the model is capable of incorporating additional information and providing estimates even when there are no available experts.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Moreover, the proposed method uses a latent variable to partition the data, so that in each partition the expert AOD estimations are aggregated in a different, optimal way.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We applied the method to combine global AOD estimations from 5 instruments aboard 4 satellites, and the results indicate it can successfully exploit labeled and unlabeled data to produce accurate aggregated AOD estimations.</a>
