<a href="#0" id="0">The increasing use of group discounts has provided opportunities for buying groups with diverse preferences to coordinate their behavior in order to exploit the best offers from multiple vendors.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We analyze this problem from the viewpoint of the vendors, asking under what conditions a vendor should adopt a volume-based price schedule rather than posting a fixed price.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We consider both the case of monopolist vendors and cases where a vendor competes with other vendors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When vendors have uncertainty about buyers' valuations specified by a known distribution, we show that a vendor is always better off posting a fixed price, provided that buyer types (valuations) are i.i.d.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">and that other vendors also use fixed prices.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also show that these assumptions cannot be relaxed: if buyer types are not i.i.d., or other vendors post discount schedules, then posting a schedule may yield a higher profit for the vendor.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We provide similar results under a distribution-free uncertainty model, where vendors minimize their maximum regret over all type realizations.</a>
