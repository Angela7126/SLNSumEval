<a href="#0" id="0">We present a powerful new account of multi-agent knowledge in the situation calculus and an automated reasoning procedure for knowledge queries.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Existing accounts of epistemic reasoning in the situation calculus require that whenever an action occurs, all agents know that an action has occurred.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This demands a level of synchronicity that is unreasonable in many multi-agent domains.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In asynchronous domains, each agent's knowledge must instead account for arbitrarily-long sequences of hidden actions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By using a persistence condition meta-operator to augment traditional regression techniques, we show how agents can reason about their own knowledge using only their internal history of observations, rather than requiring a full history of the world.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The result is a more robust and flexible account of knowledge in the situation calculus suitable for asynchronous, partially-observable multi-agent domains.</a>
