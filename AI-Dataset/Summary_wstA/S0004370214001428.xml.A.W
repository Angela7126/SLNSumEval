<a href="#0" id="0">According to the co-occurrence test, q is (non-monotonically) inferrible from p if and only if q holds in all the reasonably plausible belief change outcomes in which p holds.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A formal model is introduced that contains representations of both the co-occurrence test (for non-monotonic inference) and the Ramsey test (for conditionals).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this model, (non-nested) conditionals and non-monotonic inference satisfy the same logical principles.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, in spite of this similarity the two notions do not coincide.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">They should be carefully distinguished from each other.</a>
