<a href="#0" id="0">We introduce a new approach to the study of influence in strategic settings where the action of an individual depends on that of others in a network-structured way.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We propose network influence games as a game-theoretic model of the behavior of a large but finite networked population.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, we study an instance we call linear-influence games that allows both positive and negative influence factors, permitting reversals in behavioral choices.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We embrace pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, an important solution concept in non-cooperative game theory, to formally define the stable outcomes of a network influence game and to predict potential outcomes without explicitly considering intricate dynamics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We address an important problem in network influence, the identification of the most influential individuals, and approach it algorithmically using pure-strategy Nash-equilibria computation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Computationally, we provide (a) complexity characterizations of various problems on linear-influence games; (b) efficient algorithms for several special cases and heuristics for hard cases; and (c) approximation algorithms, with provable guarantees, for the problem of identifying the most influential individuals.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Experimentally, we evaluate our approach using both synthetic network influence games and real-world settings of general interest, each corresponding to a separate branch of the U.S.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Government.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Mathematically, we connect linear-influence games to important models in game theory: potential and polymatrix games.</a>
