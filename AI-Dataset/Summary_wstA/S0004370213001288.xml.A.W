<a href="#0" id="0">We introduce a propagator for pairs of Sum constraints, where the expressions in the sums respect a form of convexity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This propagator is parametric and can be instantiated for various concrete pairs, including Deviation, Spread, and the conjunction of Linearâ‰¤ and Among.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that despite its generality, our propagator is competitive in theory and practice with state-of-the-art propagators.</a>
