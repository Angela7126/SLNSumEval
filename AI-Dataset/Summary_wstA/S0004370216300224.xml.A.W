<a href="#0" id="0">We study the problem of verifying role-based multi-agent systems, where the number of components cannot be determined at design time.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We give a semantics that captures parameterised, generic multi-agent systems and identify three notable classes that represent different ways in which the agents may interact among themselves and with the environment.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While the verification problem is undecidable in general we put forward cutoff procedures for the classes identified.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The methodology is based on the existence of a notion of simulation between the templates for the agents and the template for the environment in the system.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that the cutoff identification procedures as well as the general algorithms that we propose are sound; for one class we show the decidability of the verification problem and present a complete cutoff procedure.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We report experimental results obtained on MCMAS-P, a novel model checker implementing the parameterised model checking methodologies here devised.</a>
