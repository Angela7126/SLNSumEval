   We show that relation extractors trained with distant supervision can benefit significantly from a small number of human labeled examples.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We propose a strategy to generate and select guidelines so that they are more generalized forms of labeled instances.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We show how to incorporate these guidelines into an existing state-of-art model for relation extraction.

   Our approach significantly improves performance in practice and thus opens up many opportunities for further research in RE where only a very limited amount of labeled training data is available.
