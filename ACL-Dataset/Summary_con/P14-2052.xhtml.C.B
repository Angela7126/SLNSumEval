   We proposed a method of summarizing a single document that included relations between sentences and relations between words.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We built a nested tree and formulated the problem of summarization as that of integer linear programming.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Our method significantly improved the ROUGE score with significantly fewer sentences than the method of EDU selection.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The results suggest that our method relaxed the fragmentation of information.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We also discussed the effectiveness of sentence subtree selection that did not restrict rooted subtrees.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Although ROUGE scores are widely used as evaluation metrics for text summarization systems, they cannot take into consideration linguistic qualities such as human readability.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Hence, we plan to conduct evaluations with people 7 7 For example, the quality question metric from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC.

  <a href="#7" id="7">
   We only used the rhetorical structures between sentences in this study.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   However, there were also rhetorical structures between EDUs inside individual sentences.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   Hence, utilizing these for sentence compression has been left for future work.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   In addition, we used rhetorical structures that were manually annotated.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   There have been related studies on building RST parsers [ 7 , 1 ] and by using such parsers, we should be able to apply our model to other corpora or to multi-document settings.
