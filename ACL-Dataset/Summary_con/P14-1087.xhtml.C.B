   We have shown in this work how temporal information in the form of timelines can be incorporated into multi-document summarization.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We achieve this through two means, using.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   1) three novel features derived from timelines to measure the saliency of sentences, and 2) TimeMMR which considers time span similarity to enhance the traditional MMR s lexical diversity measure.
  </a>

   To overcome errors propagated from the underlying temporal processing systems, we proposed a reliability filtering metric which can be used to help decide when temporal information should be used for summarization.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The use of this metric leads to an overall 5.9% gain in R-2 over the competitive SWING baseline.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   In future work, we are keen to study our proposed timeline-related features more intrinsically in the context of human-generated summaries.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   This can help us better understand their value in improving content selection.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   As noted earlier, it will be also be useful to repeat our experiments with less lexicon-influenced measures like the Pyramid method [ 20 ].
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Manual assessment of the generated summaries can also be done to give a better picture of the quality of the summaries generated with the use of timelines. Finally, given the importance of reliability filtering, a natural question is if there are other metrics that can be used to get better results.
