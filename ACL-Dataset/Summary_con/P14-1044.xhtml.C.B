   This paper presents a unified approach for aligning lexical resources.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Our method leverages a novel similarity measure which enables a direct structural comparison of concepts across different lexical resources.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Thanks to an effective ontologization method, our alignment approach can be applied to any pair of lexical resources independently of whether they provide a full-fledged network structure.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on aligning WordNet to three collaboratively-constructed resources with different characteristics, i.e.,, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and OmegaWiki.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We also show that our approach is robust across its different configurations, even when the training data is absent, enabling it to be used effectively for aligning new pairs of lexical resources for which no resource-specific training data is available.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   In future work, we plan to extend our concept similarity measure across different natural languages.
