   We have proposed a general-purpose Naive Bayes model for measuring association between two sets of random events.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The model replaced string matching in the Lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation with a probabilistic measure of gloss-context overlap.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The base model on average more than doubled the accuracy of Lesk in Senseval-2 on both fine- and coarse-grained tracks.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   With additional lexical knowledge, the model also outperformed state of the art results with statistical significance on two coarse-grained WSD tasks.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   For future work, we plan to apply the model in other shared tasks, including open-text WSD, so as to compare with more recent Lesk variants.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   We would also like to explore how to incorporate syntactic features and employ alternative statistical methods (e.g.,, parametric models) to improve probability estimation and inference.
  </a>

   Other NLP problems involving compositionality in general might also benefit from the proposed many-to-many similarity measure.
