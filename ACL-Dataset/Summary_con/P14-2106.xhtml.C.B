   This work has tried to shed light on the contribution of semantic information to dependency parsing.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The experiments were thorough, testing two treebank conversions and three parsing paradigms on automatically predicted POS tags.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Compared to [] , which used MaltParser on the LTH conversion and gold POS tags, our results can be seen as a negative outcome, as the improvements are very small and non-significant in most of the cases.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   For parser combination, WordNet semantic file information does give a small significant increment in the more fine-grained LTH representation.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   In addition we show that the improvement of automatic clusters is also weak.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   For the future, we think tdifferent parsers, eitherhat a more elaborate scheme is needed for word classes, requiring to explore different levels of generalization in the WordNet (or alternative) hierarchies.
