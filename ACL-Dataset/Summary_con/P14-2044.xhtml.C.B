   This paper demonstrates that morphology and distributional features can be combined in a flexible, joint probabilistic model, using the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   A key advantage of this framework is the ability to include arbitrary features in the prior distribution.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Future work may exploit this advantage more thoroughly for example, by using features that incorporate prior knowledge of the language s morphological structure.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Another important goal is the evaluation of this method on languages beyond English.
