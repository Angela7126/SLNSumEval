   In this paper, we have developed a joint graph model for pinyin-to-Chinese conversion with typo correction.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   This model finds a joint global optimal for typo correction and PTC conversion on the entire input pinyin sequence.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The evaluation results show that our model outperforms both previous academic systems and existing commercial products.

   In addition, the joint model is efficient enough for practical use.
