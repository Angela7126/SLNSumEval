   We built a web-domain POS tagger using a two-phase approach.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We used a WRRBM to learn the representation of the web text and incorporate the representation in a neural network, which is trained using guided learning for easy-first POS tagging.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Experiment showed that our approach achieved significant improvement in tagging the web domain text.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In addition, we found that keeping the learned representations unchanged yields better performance compared with further optimizing them on the source domain data.

   We release our tools at https://github.com/majineu/TWeb.

  <a href="#5" id="5">
   For future work, we would like to investigate the two-phase approach to more challenging tasks, such as web domain syntactic parsing.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   We believe that high-accuracy web domain taggers and parsers would benefit a wide range of downstream tasks such as machine translation.
