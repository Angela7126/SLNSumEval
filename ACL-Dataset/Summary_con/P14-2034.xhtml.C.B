   In this paper we demonstrate substantial gains on Arabic clitic segmentation for both formal and dialectal text using a single model with dialect-independent features and a simple domain adaptation strategy.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We present a new Arabic segmenter which performs better than tools employing sophisticated linguistic analysis, while also giving impressive speed improvements.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We evaluated our segmenter on broadcast news and Egyptian Arabic due to the current availability of annotated data in these domains.

   However, as data for other Arabic dialects and genres becomes available, we expect that the model s simplicity and the domain adaptation method we use will allow the system to be applied to these dialects with minimal effort and without a loss of performance in the original domains.
