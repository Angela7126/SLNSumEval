   We have introduced a novel formulation of lexicon induction operating over both words and senses, by exploiting the innate structure between the words and senses as encoded in WordNet.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   In addition, we introduce the use of loopy belief propagation over pairwise -Markov Random Fields as an effective lexicon induction algorithm.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   A notable strength of our approach is its expressiveness various types of prior knowledge and lexical relations can be encoded as node potentials and edge potentials.

  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In addition, it leads to a lexicon of better quality while also offering faster run-time and easiness of implementation.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The resulting lexicon, called ConnotationWordNet , is the first lexicon that has polarity labels over both words and senses.

   ConnotationWordNet is publicly available for research and practical use.
