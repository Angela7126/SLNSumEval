   We presented a step-wise unsupervised method for inducing verb classes from instances in giga-word corpora.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   This method first clusters predicate-argument structures to induce verb-specific semantic frames and then clusters these semantic frames across verbs to induce verb classes.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Both clustering steps are performed with exactly the same method, which is based on the Chinese Restaurant Process.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The resulting semantic frames and verb classes are open to the public and also can be searched via our web interface.

   From the results, we can see that the combination of the slot-word pair features for clustering verb-specific frames and the slot-only features for clustering across verbs is the most effective and outperforms the baselines by approximately 10 points.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   This indicates that slot distributions are more effective than lexical information in slot-word pairs for the induction of verb classes, when Levin-style classes are used for evaluation.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   This is consistent with Levin s principle of organizing verb classes according to the syntactic behavior of verbs.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   As applications of the resulting semantic frames and verb classes, we plan to integrate them into syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling and verb sense disambiguation.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   For instance, Kawahara and Kurohashi ( 2006 ) improved accuracy of dependency parsing based on Japanese semantic frames automatically induced from a raw corpus.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   It is also valuable and promising to apply the induced verb classes to NLP applications as used in metaphor identification [ 34 ] and argumentative zoning [ 8 ].
