   The novelty of this paper is a computational analysis of the relationship between the edit history and the discussion of a Wikipedia article.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   As far as we are aware, this is the first study to automatically analyze this relationship involving the textual content of edits and turns.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Based on the types of turn and edit in an edit-turn-pair, we have operationalized the notion of corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The basic assumption is that in a corresponding pair, the turn contains an explicit performative and the edit corresponds to this performative.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We have presented a machine learning system to automatically detect corresponding edit-turn-pairs.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   To test this system, we manually annotated a corpus of corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Trained and tested on this data, our system shows a significant improvement over the baseline.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   With regard to future work, an extension of the manually annotated corpus is the most important issue.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Our classifier can be used to bootstrap the annotation of additional edit-turn-pairs.
