   We have presented an unsupervised framework for abstractive summarization of spoken and written conversations based on phrasal queries.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   For content selection, we propose a sentence extraction model that incorporates query relevance and content importance into the extraction process.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   For the generation phase, we propose a ranking strategy which selects the best path in the constructed word graph based on fluency, query relevance and content.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Both automatic and manual evaluation of our model show substantial improvement over extraction-based methods, including Biased LexRank, which is considered a state-of-the-art system.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Moreover, our system also yields good grammaticality score for human evaluation and achieves comparable scores with the original sentences.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Our future work is four-fold.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   First, we are trying to improve our model by incorporating conversational features (e.g.,, speech acts.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Second, we aim at implementing a strategy to order the clusters for generating more coherent abstracts.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Third, we try to improve our generated summary by resolving coreferences and incorporating speaker information (e.g.,, names) in the clustering and sentence generation phases.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   Finally, we plan to take advantage of topic shifts to better segment the relevant parts of conversations in relation to phrasal queries.
