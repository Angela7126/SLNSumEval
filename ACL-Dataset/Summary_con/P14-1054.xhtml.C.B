   In this paper, We proposed a novel Omni-word feature taking advantages of Chinese sub-phrases.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We also introduced the soft constraint method for Chinese relation recognition.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The soft constraint utilizes four constraint conditions to catch the structure information in a relation instance.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Both the Omni-word feature and soft constrain make better use of information a sentence has, and minimize the deficiency caused by Chinese segmentation and parsing.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The size of the employed lexicon determines the dimension of the feature space.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   The first impression is that more lexicon entries result in more power.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   However, more lexicon entries also increase the computational complexity and bring in noises.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   In our future work, we will study this issue.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   The notion of soft constraints can also be extended to include more patterns, rules, regexes or syntactic constraints that have been used for information extraction.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   The usability of these strategies is also left for future work.
