   We have described a new, context-aware approach to automatically predicting aspectual class, including a new set of distributional features.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We have also introduced two new data sets of clauses labeled for aspectual class.

   Our experiments show that in any setting where labeled training data is available, improvement over the most frequent class baseline can only be reached by integrating instance-based features, though type-based features (LingInd, Dist) may provide useful priors for some verbs and successfully predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types.

  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In order to arrive at a globally well-performing system, we envision a multi-stage approach, treating verbs differently according to whether training data is available and whether or not the verb s aspectual class distribution is highly skewed.
