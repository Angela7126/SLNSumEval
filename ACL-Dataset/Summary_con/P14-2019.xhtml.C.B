   Parallel treebank construction efforts increased significantly in the recent years.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Many parallel treebanks are produced to build statistically strong language models for different languages.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   In this study, we report our preliminary efforts to build such a parallel corpus for Turkish-English pair.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We translated and transformed a subset of parse trees of Penn Treebank to Turkish.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We cover more than 50% of all sentences with a maximum length of 15-words including punctuation.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   This work constitutes the preliminary step of parallel treebank generation.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   As a next step, we will focus on morphological analysis and disambiguation of Turkish words.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   After determining the correct morphological analysis of Turkish words, we will use the parts of these analyses to replace the leaf nodes that we intentionally left as *NONE* .
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   As a future work, we plan to expand the dataset to include all Penn Treebank sentences.
