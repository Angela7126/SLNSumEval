   We have proposed reservoir sampling for reducing the storage complexity of a particle filter from linear to constant.

   This work was motivated as an expected improvement on the model of Canini et al.

   However, in the process of establishing an empirical baseline we discovered that rejuvenation does not play a significant role in the experiments of Canini et al.

   Moreover, we found that performance of the particle filter was strongly affected by the random initialization of the model, and suggested a simple approach to reduce the variability therein without using additional data.

   In conclusion, it is now an open question whether and if so, under what assumptions rejuvenation benefits particle filters for LDA and similar static Bayesian models.
