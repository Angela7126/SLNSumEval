   Our methodologies for the two proposed tasks of identifying unused and novel senses are simple extensions to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of our methodology.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Future work could pursue a more sophisticated methodology, using non-linear combinations of sim u'\u2062' ( s i , t j ) for computing the affinity measures or multiple features in a supervised context.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We contend, however, that these extensions are ultimately a preliminary demonstration to the flexibility and robustness of our methodology.

   A natural next step for this research would be to couple sense distribution estimation and the detection of unattested senses with evidence from the context, using topics or other information about the local context (e.g., ) to carry out unsupervised wsd of individual token occurrences of a given word.

   In summary, we have proposed a topic modelling-based method for estimating word sense distributions, based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes and the earlier work of on word sense induction, in probabilistically mapping the automatically-learned topics to senses in a sense inventory.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   We evaluated the ability of the method to learn predominant senses and induce word sense distributions, based on a broad range of datasets and two separate sense inventories.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   In doing so, we established that our method is comparable to the approach of at predominant sense learning, and superior at inducing word sense distributions.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   We further demonstrated the applicability of the method to the novel tasks of detecting word senses which are unattested in a corpus, and identifying novel senses which are found in a corpus but not captured in a word sense inventory.
