   This work focuses on two important aspects of answer reranking for non-factoid QA similarity between question and answer content, and answer structure.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   While the former has been addressed with a variety of lexical-semantic models, the latter has received little attention.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Here we show how to model answer structures using discourse and how to integrate the two aspects into a holistic framework.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Empirically we show that modeling answer discourse structures is complementary to modeling lexical semantic similarity and that the best performance is obtained when they are tightly integrated.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple genres and question types and obtain benefits of up to 24% relative improvement over a strong baseline that combines information retrieval and lexical semantics.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   We further demonstrate that answer discourse structures are largely independent of domain and transfer well, even between radically different datasets.
