   We have proposed an algorithm for using a two-step collaboration between non-professional translators and post-editors to obtain professional-quality translations.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Our method, based on a co-ranking model, selects the best crowdsourced translation from a set of candidates, and is capable of selecting translations which near professional quality.

   Crowdsourcing can play a pivotal role in future efforts to create parallel translation datasets.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In addition to its benefits of cost and scalability, crowdsourcing provides access to languages that currently fall outside the scope of statistical machine translation research.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   In future work on crowdsourced translation, further benefits in quality improvement and cost reduction could stem from 1) building ground truth data sets based on high-quality Turkers translations and 2) identifying when sufficient data has been collected for a given input, to avoid soliciting unnecessary redundant translations.
