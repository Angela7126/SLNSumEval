   We introduced a model for leveraging situational information in learning vector-space representations of words that are sensitive to the speaker s social context.

   While our results use geographical information in learning low-dimensional representations, other contextual variables are straightforward to include as well; incorporating effects for time such as time of day, month of year and absolute year may be a powerful tool for revealing periodic and historical influences on lexical semantics.

   Our approach explores the degree to which geography, and other contextual factors, influence word meaning in addition to frequency of usage.

  <a href="#3" id="3">
   By allowing all words in different regions (or more generally, with different metadata factors) to exist in the same vector space, we are able compare different points in that space for example, to ask what terms used in Chicago are most similar to hot dog in New York, or what word groups shift together in the same region in comparison to the background (indicating the shift of an entire semantic field.
