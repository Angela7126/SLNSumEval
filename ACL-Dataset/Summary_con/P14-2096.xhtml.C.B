   Cross-language article linking is the task of creating links between online encyclopedia articles in different languages that describe the same content.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We propose a method based on article hypernym and topic model to link English Wikipedia articles to corresponding Chinese Baidu Baike articles.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Our method comprises two stages candidate selection and candidate ranking.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We formulate candidate selection as a cross-language information retrieval task based on the title similarity between English and Chinese articles.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   In candidate ranking, we employ several features of the articles in our SVM model.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   To evaluate our method, we compile a dataset from English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike, containing the 500 most popular Baidu articles.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Evaluation results of our method show an MRR of up to 80.95% and a recall of 87.46%.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   This shows that our method is effective in generating cross-language links between English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike with high accuracy.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Our method does not heavily depend on linguistic characteristics and can be easily extended to generate cross-language article links among different encyclopedias in other languages.
