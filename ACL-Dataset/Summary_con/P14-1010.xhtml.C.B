   We have explored deeper integration of morphological desegmentation into the statistical machine translation pipeline.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We have presented a novel, finite-state-inspired approach to lattice desegmentation, which allows the system to account for a desegmented view of many possible translations, without any modification to the decoder or any restrictions on phrase extraction.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   When applied to English-to-Arabic translation, lattice desegmentation results in a 1.0 BLEU point improvement over one-best desegmentation, and a 1.7 BLEU point improvement over unsegmented translation.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We have also applied our approach to English-to-Finnish translation, and although segmentation in general does not currently help, we are able to show significant improvements over a 1-best desegmentation baseline.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   In the future, we plan to explore introducing multiple segmentation options into the lattice, and the application of our method to a full morphological analysis (as opposed to segmentation) of the target language.

   Eventually, we would like to replace the functionality of factored translation models [ 18 ] with lattice transformation and augmentation.
