   We have shown that it is possible to detect machine translation from monolingual corpora containing both machine translated text and human generated text, at sentence level.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   There is a strong correlation between the detection accuracy that can be obtained and the BLEU score or the human evaluation score of the machine translation itself.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   This correlation holds whether or not a reference set is used.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   This suggests that our method might be used as an unsupervised quality estimation method when no reference sentences are available, such as for resource-poor source languages.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Further work might include applying our methods to other language pairs and domains, acquiring word-level quality estimation or integrating our method in a machine translation system.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Furthermore, additional features and feature selection techniques can be applied, both for improving detection accuracy and for strengthening the correlation with human quality estimation.
