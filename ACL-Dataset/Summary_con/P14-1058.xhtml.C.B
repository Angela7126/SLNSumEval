   We proposed a method to predict the distribution of a word across domains.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We first create a distributional representation for a word using the data from a single domain, and then learn a Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) model to predict the distribution of a word in a target domain given its distribution in a source domain.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We evaluated the proposed method in two domain adaptation tasks cross-domain POS tagging and cross-domain sentiment classification.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Our experiments show that without requiring any task-specific customisations to our distribution prediction method, it outperforms competitive baselines and achieves comparable results to the current state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.
