   A revision often contains multiple corrections that address different writing mistakes.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We explore building computer programs to accurately detect individual corrections in one single revision.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   One major challenge lies in determining whether consecutive basic-edits address the same mistake.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We propose a classifier specialized in this task.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Our experiments suggest that.

   1) the proposed classifier reduces correction mis-detections in previous systems by 1/3, leading to significant overall system performance.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   2) our method is generalizable over different data collections.
