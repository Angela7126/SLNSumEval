   We considered the problem of unsupervised solution post identification from discussion forum threads.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Towards identifying solutions to the problem posed in the initial post, we proposed the usage of a hitherto unexplored textual feature for the solution identification problem; that of lexical correlations between problems and solutions.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We model and harness lexical correlations using translation models, in the company of unigram language models that are used to characterize reply posts, and formulate a clustering-based EM approach for solution identification.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We show that our technique is able to effectively identify solutions using just one non-content based feature, the post position, whereas previous techniques in literature have depended heavily on structural features (that are not always available in many forums) and supervised information.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Our technique is seen to outperform the sole unsupervised solution identification technique in literature, by a large margin; further, our method is even seen to be competitive to recent methods that use supervision, beating one of them comfortably, and trailing another by a narrow margin.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   In short, our empirical analysis illustrates the superior performance and establishes our method as the method of choice for unsupervised solution identification.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Exploration into the usage of translation models to aid other operations in discussion forums such as proactive word suggestions for solution authoring would be interesting direction for follow-up work.

   Discovery of problem-solution pairs in cases where the problem post is not known beforehand, would be a challenging problem to address.
