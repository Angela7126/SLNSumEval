   We have shown that objective adjectives are most likely to modify concrete nouns, and that non-literal combinations can emerge when this principle is violated (Section 3.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Indeed, the occurrence of an adjective with a more abstract noun than those it typically modifies is a strikingly consistent indicator of metaphoricity (Table 2.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   In addition, we showed that both concreteness and subjectivity improve the automatic classification of adjective-noun pairs according to compositionality or modification type (Section 4.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Importantly, a classifier with both subjectivity and concreteness features outperforms concreteness-only classifiers, including those proposed in previous work.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The results underline the relevance of both subjectivity and concreteness to lexical and phrasal semantics, and their application to language processing tasks.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   We hypothesize that concreteness and subjectivity are fundamental to human language processing because language is precisely the conveyance of information about the world from one party to another.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   In decoding this signal, it is clearly informative to understand to what extent the information refers directly to the world, and also to what extent it reports a fact versus an opinion.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   We believe these dimensions will ultimately prove essential for computational systems aiming to replicate human performance in interpreting language.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   As the results suggest, they may be particularly important for capturing the intricacies of semantic composition and thus extending representations beyond the lexeme.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   Of course, two dimensions alone are not sufficient to reflect all of the subtleties of adjective and noun semantics.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   For instance, our model classifies white spirit , a transparent cleaning product, as non-literal, since the lexical concreteness score does not allow for strong noun polysemy.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   Further, it makes no allowance for wider sentential context, which can be an important clue to modification type in such cases.
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   We aim to address these limitations in future work by integrating subjectivity and concreteness with conventially acquired semantic representations, and, ultimately, models that integrate input corresponding to the perceptual modalities.
