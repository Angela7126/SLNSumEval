   We have presented a simple but effective approach to integrating the sentence skeleton information into a phrase-based system.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves very promising BLEU improvements and TER reductions on the NIST evaluation data.
  </a>

   In our future work we plan to investigate methods of integrating both syntactic models (for skeleton translation) and phrasal models (for full translation) in our system.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We also plan to study sophisticated reordering models for skeleton translation, rather than reusing the baseline reordering model which is learned on the full sentences.
