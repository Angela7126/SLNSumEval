   In this paper, we introduced a novel pre-ordering approach based on dependency parsing for a Chinese-English PBSMT system.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The results showed that our approach achieved a BLEU score gain of 1.61.

   Moreover, our dependency-based pre-ordering rule set substantially decreased the time for applying pre-ordering rules about 60% compared with WR07, on the training set of 1M sentences pairs.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The overall accuracy of our rule set is 60.0%, which is almost at the same level as the WR07 rule set.

   These results indicated that dependency parsing is more effective for conducting pre-ordering for Chinese-English PBSMT.

   Although our work focused on Chinese, the ideas can also be applied to other languages.

   In the future, we attempt to create more efficient pre-ordering rules by exploiting the rich information in dependency structures.
