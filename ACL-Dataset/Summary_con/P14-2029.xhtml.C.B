   In this paper, we developed a system for predicting grammaticality on an ordinal scale and created a labeled dataset that we have released publicly ( 2 ) to enable more realistic evaluations in future research.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Our system outperformed an existing state-of-the-art system [ 16 ] in evaluations on binary and ordinal scales.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   This is the most realistic evaluation of methods for predicting sentence-level grammaticality to date.

   Surprisingly, the system from Post ( 2011 ) performed quite poorly on the GUG dataset.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We speculate that this is due to the fact that the Post system relies heavily on features extracted from automatic syntactic parses.

  <a href="#5" id="5">
   While Post found that such a system can effectively distinguish grammatical news text sentences from sentences generated by a language model, measuring the grammaticality of real sentences from language learners seems to require a wider variety of features, including n -gram counts, language model scores, etc.

   Of course, our findings do not indicate that syntactic features such as those from Post ( 2011 ) are without value.
  </a>

   In future work, it may be possible to improve grammaticality measurement by integrating such features into a larger system.
