   We presented DepecheMood , an emotion lexicon built in a novel and totally automated way by harvesting crowd-sourced affective annotation from a social news network.

   Our experimental results indicate high-coverage and high-precision of the lexicon, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches even when using the resource with very na ve classification and regression strategies.

   Our future work will include testing Singular Value Decomposition on the word-by-document matrices, allowing to propagate emotions values for a document to similar words non present in the document itself, and the study of perceived mood effects on virality indices and readers engagement by exploiting tweets, likes, reshares and comments.
