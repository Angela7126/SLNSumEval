   In this paper we have proposed an unsupervised Bayesian model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract the structured representation of events from social media data.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Instead of employing labeled corpora for training, the proposed model only requires the identification of named entities, locations and time expressions.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   After that, the model can automatically extract events which involving a named entity at certain time, location, and with event-related keywords based on the co-occurrence patterns of the event elements.

   Our proposed model has been evaluated on the FSD corpus.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Experimental results show our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by over 7% in F-measure.

   In future work, we plan to investigate inferring geolocations automatically from tweets.

   We also intend to study a better method to infer date more accurately from tweets and explore efficient ranking strategies to rank evens extracted for a better presentation of results.
