   Language acquisition is a complex task, in which many heterogeneous sources of information may be useful.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   In this paper, we investigated whether contextual semantic information could be of help when learning phonetic categories.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We found that this contextual information can improve phonetic learning performance considerably, especially in situations where there is a high degree of phonetic ambiguity in the word-forms that learners hear.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   This suggests that previous models that have ignored semantic information may have underestimated the information that is available to infants.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Our model illustrates one way in which language learners might harness the rich information that is present in the world without first needing to acquire a full inventory of word meanings.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   The contextual semantic information that the TLD model tracks is similar to that potentially used in other linguistic learning tasks.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Theories of cross-situational word learning ( 40 ; 53 ) assume that sensitivity to situational co-occurrences between words and non-linguistic contexts is a precursor to learning the meanings of individual words.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Under this view, contextual semantics is available to infants well before they have acquired large numbers of semantic minimal pairs.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   However, recent experimental evidence indicates that learners do not always retain detailed information about the referents that are present in a scene when they hear a word ( 27 ; 49.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   This evidence poses a direct challenge to theories of cross-situational word learning.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   Our account does not necessarily require learners to track co-occurrences between words and individual objects, but instead focuses on more abstract information about salient events and topics in the environment; it will be important to investigate to what extent infants encode this information and use it in phonetic learning.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   Regardless of the specific way in which infants encode semantic information, our method of adding this information by using LDA topics from transcript data was shown to be effective.
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   This method is practical because it can approximate semantic information without relying on extensive manual annotation.
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   The LD model extended the phonetic categorization task by adding word contexts; the TLD model presented here goes even further, adding larger situational contexts.
  </a>
  <a href="#14" id="14">
   Both forms of top-down information help the low-level task of classifying acoustic signals into phonetic categories, furthering a holistic view of language learning with interaction across multiple levels.
