   This paper proposed a novel CWS model for the SMT task.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   This model aims to maintain the linguistic segmentation supervisions from treebank data and simultaneously integrate useful bilingual segmentations induced from the bitexts.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   This objective is accomplished by three main steps.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   1) learn word boundaries from character-based alignments; 2) encode the learned word boundaries into a GP constraint; and 3) training a CRFs model, under the GP constraint, by using the PR framework.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The empirical results indicate that the proposed model can yield better segmentations for SMT.
