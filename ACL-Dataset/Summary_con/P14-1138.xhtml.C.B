   We have proposed a word alignment model based on an RNN, which captures long alignment history through recurrent architectures.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Furthermore, we proposed an unsupervised method for training our model using NCE and introduced an agreement constraint that encourages word embeddings to be consistent across alignment directions.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Our experiments have shown that the proposed model outperforms the FFNN-based model [ 40 ] for word alignment and machine translation, and that the agreement constraint improves alignment performance.

   In future, we plan to employ contexts composed of surrounding words (e.g.,, c ( f j ) or c ( e a j ) in the FFNN-based model) in our model, even though our model implicitly encodes such contexts in the alignment history.

   We also plan to enrich each hidden layer in our model with multiple layers following the success of Yang et al.

  <a href="#5" id="5">
   [ 40 ] , in which multiple hidden layers improved the performance of the FFNN-based model.

   In addition, we would like to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method for other datasets.
