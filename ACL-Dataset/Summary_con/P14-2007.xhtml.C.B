   We presented a metric called Sentiment Annotation Complexity (SAC), a metric in SA research that has been unexplored until now.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   First, the process of data preparation through eye tracking, labeled with the SAC score was elaborated.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Using this data set and a set of linguistic features, we trained a regression model to predict SAC.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Our predictive framework for SAC resulted in a mean percentage error of 22.02%, and a moderate correlation of 0.57 between the predicted and observed SAC values.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Finally, we observe a negative correlation between the classifier confidence scores and a SAC, as expected.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   As a future work, we would like to investigate how SAC of a test sentence can be used to choose a classifier from an ensemble, and to determine the pre-processing steps (entity-relationship extraction, for example.
