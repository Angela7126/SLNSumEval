   This paper presents a translation-based KB-QA method that integrates semantic parsing and QA in one unified framework.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Comparing to the baseline system using an independent semantic parser with state-of-the-art performance, we achieve better results on a general domain evaluation set.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Several directions can be further explored in the future i) We plan to design a method that can extract question patterns automatically, using existing labeled question patterns and KB as weak supervision.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   As we discussed in the experiment part, how to mine high-quality question patterns is worth further study for the QA task; (ii) We plan to integrate an ad-hoc NER into our KB-QA system to alleviate the entity detection issue; (iii) In fact, our proposed QA framework can be generalized to other intelligence besides knowledge bases as well.

   Any method that can generate answers to questions, such as the Web-based QA approach, can be integrated into this framework, by using them in the question translation component.
