   We carried out a systematic study on OM from YouTube comments by training a set of supervised multi-class classifiers distinguishing between video and product related opinions.

   We use standard feature vectors augmented by shallow syntactic trees enriched with additional conceptual information.

   This paper makes several contributions i) it shows that effective OM can be carried out with supervised models trained on high quality annotations; (ii) it introduces a novel annotated corpus of YouTube comments, which we make available for the research community; (iii) it defines novel structural models and kernels, which can improve on feature vectors, e.g.,, up to 30% of relative improvement in type classification, when little data is available, and demonstrates that the structural model scales well to other domains.

   In the future, we plan to work on a joint model to classify all the comments of a given video, s.t it is possible to exploit latent dependencies between entities and the sentiments of the comment thread.

   Additionally, we plan to experiment with hierarchical multi-label classifiers for the full task (in place of a flat multi-class learner.
