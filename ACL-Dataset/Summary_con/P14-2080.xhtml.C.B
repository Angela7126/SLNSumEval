   Special domains such as patents or Wikipedia offer the possibility to extract cross-lingual relevance data from citation and link graphs.

   These data can be used to directly optimizing cross-lingual ranking models.

   We showed on two different large-scale ranking scenarios that a supervised combination of orthogonal information sources such as domain-knowledge, translation knowledge, and ranking-specific word associations by far outperforms a pipeline of query translation and retrieval.

   We conjecture that if these types of information sources are available, a supervised ranking approach will yield superior results in other retrieval scenarios as well.
