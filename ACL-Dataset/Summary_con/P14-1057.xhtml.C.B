   Medical record retrieval is an important domain-specific IR problem.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Concept-based representation is an effective approach to dealing with ambiguity terminology in medical domain.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   However, the results of the NLP tools used to generate the concept-based representation are often not perfect.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In this paper, we present a general methodology that can use axiomatic approaches as guidance to regularize the concept weighting strategies to address the limitations caused by the inaccurate concept mapping and improve the retrieval performance.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   In particular, we proposed two weighting regularization methods based on the relations among concepts.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Experimental results show that the proposed methods can significantly outperform existing retrieval functions.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   There are many interesting directions for our future work.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   First, we plan to study how to automatically predict whether to use concept-based indexing based on the quality of MetaMap results, and explore whether the proposed methods are applicable for other entity linking methods.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Second, we will study how to leverage other information from knowledge bases to further improve the performance.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   Third, more experiments could be conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods when using other ranking strategies.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   Finally, it would be interesting to study how to follow the proposed methodology to study other domain-specific IR problems.
