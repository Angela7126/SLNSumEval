   This model uses language-independent (rather than lexical or language specific) conceptual features.

   Not only do we establish benchmarks for Spanish, Farsi, and Russian, but we also achieve state-of-the-art performance in English.

   In addition, we present a comparison of relative contributions of several types of features.
