   In order to extract new sentiment words from large-scale user-generated content, this paper proposes a fully unsupervised, purely data-driven, and almost knowledge-free (except POS tags) framework.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We design statistical measures to quantify the utility of a lexical pattern and to measure the possibility of a word being a new word, respectively.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The method is almost free of linguistic resources (except POS tags), and does not rely on elaborated linguistic rules.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We conduct extensive experiments to reveal the influence of different statistical measures in new word finding.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Comparative experiments show that our proposed method outperforms baselines remarkably.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Experiments also demonstrate that inclusion of new sentiment words benefits sentiment classification definitely.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   From linguistic perspectives, our framework is capable to extract adjective new words because the lexical patterns usually modify adjective words.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   As future work, we are considering how to extract other types of new sentiment words, such as nounal new words that can express sentiment.
