   In this paper we introduced the stochastic iterative correction method for spell check corrections.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Our experimental evaluation showed that the proposed method improved the performance of popular spelling correction approach the noisy channel model in the correction of difficult spelling errors.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We showed how to eliminate the local minima issue of simulated annealing and proposed a technique to make our algorithm deterministic.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The experiments conducted on the specialized datasets have shown that our method significantly improves the performance of the correction of hard spelling errors (by 6.6% F 1 ) while maintaining good performance on common spelling errors.
  </a>

   In continuation of the work we are considering to expand the method to correct errors in multi-word queries, extend the method to work with discriminative models, and use a query performance prediction method, which tells for a query whether our algorithm needs to be applied.
