<div class="ltx_abstract"><h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p class="ltx_p">An important search task in the biomedical domain is to find medical
records of patients who are qualified for a clinical trial.
One commonly used approach is to apply NLP tools to map terms
from queries and documents to concepts and then compute
the relevance scores based on the concept-based representation.
However, the mapping results are not perfect, and none
of previous work studied how to deal with them in the retrieval process.
In this paper, we focus on addressing the limitations caused by the imperfect
mapping results and study how to further improve the retrieval performance of
the concept-based ranking methods. In particular, we apply axiomatic approaches
and propose two weighting regularization methods that adjust the weighting
based on the relations among the concepts. Experimental results show that the
proposed methods are effective to improve the retrieval performance, and their
performances are comparable to other top-performing systems in the TREC Medical
Records Track.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">With the increasing use of electronic health records,
it becomes urgent to leverage this rich information
resource about patients’ health conditions to transform
research in health and medicine. As an example, when
developing a cohort for a clinical trial,
researchers need to identify patients matching a set of clinical
criteria based on their medical records during their
hospital visits <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="White paper: toward a national framework for the secondary use of health data: an american medical informatics association white paper" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib39" title="Achieving a nationwide learning health system" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. This selection
process is clearly a domain-specific retrieval problem,
which searches for <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">relevant medical records</span> that contain
useful information about their corresponding patients’
qualification to the criteria specified in a query,
e.g., “female patient with breast cancer with mastectomies during
admission”.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Intuitively, to better solve this domain-specific retrieval problem,
we need to understand the requirements specified in a query
and identify the documents satisfying these requirements based on
their semantic meanings. In the past decades, significant efforts
have been put on constructing biomedical knowledge bases <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="An overview of metamap: historical perspective and recent advances" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="ICD-9-CM: International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, 5th Edition" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>
and developing natural language processing (NLP) tools, such as MetaMap,
to utilize the information from the knowledge bases <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="Effective mapping of biomedical text to the UMLS Metathesaurus: the MetaMap program." class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="UMLS-Interface and UMLS-Similarity : Open Source Software for Measuring Paths and Semantic Similarity" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>.
These efforts make it possible to map free text to concepts and use
these concepts to represent queries and documents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Indeed, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">concept-based representation</span> is one of the commonly used approaches
that leverage knowledge bases to improve the retrieval performance
<cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="A task-specific query and document representation for medical records search" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="Learning to combine representations for medical records search" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
The basic idea is to represent both queries and documents as
“bags of concepts”, where the concepts are identified based on the information
from the knowledge bases. This method has been shown to be more effective
than traditional term-based representation in the medical record retrieval
because of its ability to handle the ambiguity in the medical terminology.
However, this method also suffers the limitation that its effectiveness depends
on the accuracy of the concept mapping results. As a result, directly
applying existing weighting strategies might lead to non-optimal retrieval
performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In this paper, to address the limitation caused by the inaccurate concept mapping results,
we propose to regularize the weighting strategies in the concept-based
representation methods. Specifically, by applying the axiomatic approaches <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="An exploration of axiomatic approaches to information retrieval" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>,
we analyze the retrieval functions with concept-based representation and find that
they may violate some reasonable retrieval constraints. We then propose two concept-based
weighting regularization methods so that the regularized retrieval functions would satisfy
the retrieval constraints and achieve better retrieval performance.
Experimental results over two TREC collections show that both proposed concept-based weighting
regularization methods can improve the retrieval performance,
and their performance is comparable with the best systems of the TREC Medical
Records tracks <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="Overview of the TREC 2011 Medical Records Track" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="Overview of the TREC 2012 Medical Records Track" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Many NLP techniques have been developed to understand the semantic meaning
of textual information, and are often applied to improve the search accuracy.
However, due to the inherent ambiguity of natural languages, the results of
NLP tools are not perfect.
One of our contributions is to present a
general methodology that can be used
to adjust existing IR techniques based on the inaccurate NLP results.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The Medical Records track of the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC)

For example, Qi and Laquerre used MetaMap to generate the concept-based
representation and then apply a vector space retrieval model for ranking, and their
results are one of the top ranked runs in the TREC 2012 Medical Records track <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="Retrieving Medical Records: NEC Labs America at TREC 2012 Medical Record Track" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
To further improve the performance, Limsopatham et al. proposed a task-specific
representation, i.e., using only four types of concepts (symptom, diagnostic test,
diagnosis and treatment) in the concept-based representation and a query expansion
method based on the relationships among the medical concepts
<cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="A task-specific query and document representation for medical records search" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="Inferring conceptual relationships to improve medical records search" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.
Moreover, they also proposed a learning approach to combine
both term-based and concept-based representation to further improve the
performance <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="Learning to combine representations for medical records search" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.</p>

For example, Yan et al. proposed a granularity-based document ranking
model that utilizes ontologies to identify document concepts.
However, none of the previous work has studied how to regularize
the weight of concepts based on their relations.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">It is well known that the effectiveness of a retrieval function is closely related to

However, existing studies on concept-based representation still used weighting

and divergence from randomness (DFR) <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="Inferring conceptual relationships to improve medical records search" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and did not
take the inaccurate concept mapping results into consideration.
Compared with previous work, we focus on addressing the limitation caused by the inaccurate
concept mapping. Note that our efforts are orthogonal to existing work, and it is expected to
bring additional improvement to the retrieval performance.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">We follow the problem setup used in the TREC medical record track <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="Overview of the TREC 2011 Medical Records Track" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="Overview of the TREC 2012 Medical Records Track" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
The task is to retrieve relevant patient visits with respect to a query. Since each visit can be
associated with multiple medical records, the relevance of a visit is related to the relevance
of individual associated medical records. Existing studies computed the relevance
scores at either visit-level, where all the medical records of a visit are merged into
a visit document <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib54" title="NLM at TREC 2012 Medical Records Track" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="Learning to selectively rank patients’ medical history" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>, or record-level, where we can
first compute the relevance score of individual records and then aggregate their scores
as the relevance score of a visit <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="Learning to selectively rank patients’ medical history" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="Combining multi-level evidence for medical record retrieval" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="A task-specific query and document representation for medical records search" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
In this paper, we focus on the visit-level relevance because of its simplicity.
In particular, given a patient’s visit, all the medical records generated from this visit are
merged as a document. Note that
our proposed concept-weighting strategies can also be easily applied to record-level relevance modeling.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a metathesaurus containing
information from more than 100 controlled medical terminologies
such as the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)
and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Specifically, it contains the information
about over 2.8 million biomedical concepts. Each concept is labeled with a
Concept Unique Identifier (CUI) and has a preferred name and a semantic type.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Moreover, NLP tools for utilizing the information from
UMLS have been developed. In particular, MetaMap <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="Effective mapping of biomedical text to the UMLS Metathesaurus: the MetaMap program." class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> can
take a text string as the input, segment it into phrases,

The confidence score is an indicator of the quality of the phrase-to-concept

and cohesiveness <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="Effective mapping of biomedical text to the UMLS Metathesaurus: the MetaMap program." class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. These four measures try to evaluate the mapping
from different angles, such as the involvement of the central part, the distance of the
concept to the original phrase, and how well the concept matches the phrase.

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Traditional retrieval models are based on “bag of terms” representation. One limitation
of this representation is that relevance scores are computed based on the matching of terms
rather than the meanings. As a result, the system may fail to retrieve the relevant documents
that do not contain any query terms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">To overcome this limitation, concept-based representation has been proposed to bridge the
vocabulary gap between documents and queries <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib69" title="Retrieving Medical Records: NEC Labs America at TREC 2012 Medical Record Track" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="Learning to combine representations for medical records search" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="Exploiting SNOMED CT Concepts &amp; Relationships for Clinical Information Retrieval: Australian e-Health Research Centre and Queensland University of Technology at the TREC 2012 Medical Track" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>.
In particular, MetaMap is used to map terms from queries and documents (e.g., medical records)
to the semantic concepts from biomedical knowledge bases such as UMLS.
Within the concept-based representation, the query can then
be represented as a bag of all the generated CUIs in the MetaMap results.
For example, the query from Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ A Study of Concept-based Weighting Regularization  for Medical Records Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> can be represented as

<div id="S4.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Although existing retrieval functions can be directly applied to concept-based
representation, they may lead to non-optimal performance. This is mainly caused
by the fact that MetaMap may generate more than one mapped concepts for an
aspect, i.e., a semantic unit in the text.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Ideally, an aspect will be mapped to only <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">one</span> concept, and
different concepts would represent different semantic meanings. Under such
a situation, traditional retrieval functions would likely work well and generate
satisfying retrieval performance since the relations among concepts are
independent which is consistent with the assumptions made in traditional IR
<cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="Introduction to information retrieval" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">However, the mapping results generated by MetaMap are not perfect. Although
MetaMap is able to rank all the candidate concepts with the confidence score
and pick the most likely one, the accuracy is not very high. In particular,
our preliminary results show that turning on the disambiguation functionality
provided by MetaMap (i.e., returning only the most likely concept for each query)
could lead to worse retrieval performance than using all the candidate mappings.
Thus, we use the one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap, in which
each aspect can be mapped to multiple concepts.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, such one-to-many concept mappings could hinder the retrieval
performance in the following two ways.</p>

<div id="I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The multiple concepts generated from the same aspect are related, which
is inconsistent with the independence assumption made in the existing retrieval
functions <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="Introduction to information retrieval" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. For example, as shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 Related Work ‣ A Study of Concept-based Weighting Regularization  for Medical Records Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>,
“dental caries” is mapped to three concepts. It is clear that the concepts
are related, but existing retrieval functions are unable to capture their
relations and would compute the weight of each concept independently.</p>

<div id="I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap could arbitrarily
inflate the weights of some query aspects.

to 2 concepts while “dental caries” is mapped to 3 concepts.
In the existing retrieval functions,
term occurrences are important relevance signals. However,
when converting the text to concepts representation using MetaMap, the
occurrences of the concepts are determined by not only the original term occurrences,
a good indicator of relevance, but also the number of mapped concepts,
which is determined by MetaMap and has nothing to do with the relevance status.

<p class="ltx_p">Now the remaining question is how to select the representative concept
from all the variants. There are three options: select the concept
with the maximum IDF, average IDF, or minimum IDF. We conduct
exploratory data analysis on these three options. In particular,
for each option, we generate a plot indicating the correlation
between the IDF value of a concept and the relevance probability
of the concept (i.e., the probability that a document containing
the concept is relevant). Note that both original and replaced
IDF values are shown in the plot for each option.

results. It is clear that the right plot (i.e., selecting the concept
with the maximum IDF as the representative concept) is the best
choice since the changes make the points less scattered.
In fact, this can also be confirmed by experimental results as reported

to two concepts while the other is mapped to three.
Moreover, it could also impact the accuracy of the concept IDF values.
Consider “colonoscopies” and “adult”, it is clear that the first term
is more important than the second one, which is consistent with their
term IDF values, i.e., 7.52 and 2.92, respectively. However, with the
concept-based representation, the IDF value of the concept “colonoscopies”(C0009378) is
2.72, which is even smaller than that of concept “adult” (C1706450), i.e., 2.92.</p>

<div id="S5.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We conduct experiments using two data sets from the TREC
Medical Records track 2011 and 2012. The data sets are denoted as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Med11</span>
and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Med12</span>. Both data sets used the same document collection
with 100,866 medical records, each of which is associated with a unique
patient visit to the hospital or emergency department. Since the task is
to retrieve relevant visits, we merged all the records from a visit to form
a single document for the visit, which leads to 17,198 documents in the collection.
There are 34 queries in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Med11</span>
and 47 in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Med12</span>.
These queries were developed by domain experts based on the “inclusion
criteria” of a clinical study <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="Overview of the TREC 2011 Medical Records Track" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="Overview of the TREC 2012 Medical Records Track" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">After applying MetaMap to both documents and queries, we can construct a concept-based
collection.
Since documents are often much longer, we can first segment them into sentences,
get the mapping results for each sentence, and then merge
them together to generate the concept-based representation for
the documents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">

including the number of unique tokens in the collection (i.e., the number of terms for term-based representation
and the number of concepts for concept-based representation), the average number of tokens in the documents (AvgDL)
and the average number of tokens in the queries for these two collections (AvgQL11 and
AvgQL12).
It is interesting to see that the number of unique tokens is much smaller when using the concept-based indexing.
This is expected since terms are semantically related and a group of related terms would be
mapped to one semantic concept. Moreover, we observe that the document length
and query length are similar for both collections. This is caused by the
fact that concepts are related and the MetaMap would map an aspect
to multiple related concepts.</p>

Following the evaluation methodology used in the medical record track,
we use MAP@1000 as the primary measure for <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Med11</span> and also report bpref. For <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Med12</span>, we take infNDCG@100 as the primary
measure and also report infAP@100. Different measures were
chosen for these two sets mainly because
different pooling strategies were used to create the judgment pools

<p class="ltx_p">Results show that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Balanced</span> method can significantly improve the

outperforms the baseline methods in terms of the primary measure on both

one baseline method. It is not surprising to see that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Balanced</span> method
is more effective than <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Unified</span> since the former satisfies both of the
proposed retrieval constraints while the latter satisfies only one.
Finally, we noticed that the performance difference between
TSConcept-BL and Concept-BL is not as significant as the ones reported in the
previous study <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="A task-specific query and document representation for medical records search" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, which is probably caused by
the difference of problem set up (i.e., record-level vs. visit-level as discussed
in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Problem Formulation ‣ 3 Concept-based Representation for Medical Records Retrieval ‣ A Study of Concept-based Weighting Regularization  for Medical Records Search" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a>).</p>

<p class="ltx_p">We also conduct experiments to train parameters on one collection and compare
the testing performance on the other collection. The results are summarized

effective regularization method. The testing performance is very close
to the optimal performance, which indicates that the proposed methods are robust
with respect to the parameter setting.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Moreover, we would like to point out that the testing performance of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Balanced</span>
is comparable to the top ranked runs from the TREC Medical records track.
For example, the performance of the best automatic system in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Med11</span>
(e.g., CengageM11R3) is 0.552 in terms of bpref, while the performance of the best

of infNDCG. Note that the top system of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Med12</span> used multiple external resources such
as Wikipedia and Web, while we did not use such resources.
Moreover, our performance might be
further improved if we apply the result filtering methods used by many TREC participants

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Medical record retrieval is an important domain-specific IR problem.
Concept-based representation is an effective approach to dealing with
ambiguity terminology in medical domain. However, the results of the
NLP tools used to generate the concept-based representation are often
not perfect. In this paper, we present a general methodology that
can use axiomatic approaches as guidance to regularize the concept
weighting strategies to address the limitations caused by the inaccurate
concept mapping and improve the retrieval performance.
In particular, we proposed two weighting regularization methods based
on the relations among concepts. Experimental results show that the proposed
methods can significantly outperform existing retrieval functions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">There are many interesting directions for our future work.
First, we plan to study how to automatically predict whether to use concept-based
indexing based on the quality of MetaMap results, and explore whether
the proposed methods are applicable for other entity linking methods.
Second, we will study how to leverage other information from knowledge bases to
further improve the performance.
Third, more experiments could be conducted to examine the effectiveness of the
proposed methods when using other ranking strategies.
Finally, it would be interesting to study how to
follow the proposed methodology to study other domain-specific IR problems.</p>
