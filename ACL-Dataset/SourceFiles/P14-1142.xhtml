<p class="ltx_p">It is very import
for Chinese language processing
with the aid of an efficient
input method engine (IME),
of which pinyin-to-Chinese (PTC) conversion
is the core part.
Meanwhile, though typos are inevitable during user pinyin inputting,
existing IMEs paid little attention to such big inconvenience.
In this paper, motivated by a key equivalence of two decoding algorithms,
we propose a joint graph model to globally optimize PTC and typo correction for IME.
The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms both existing academic and commercial IMEs.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The daily life of Chinese people
heavily depends on Chinese input method engine (IME),
no matter whether one is composing an E-mail,
writing an article,
or sending a text message.
However, every Chinese word
inputted into computer
or cellphone cannot be typed through
one-to-one mapping of key-to-letter inputting directly,
but has to go through an IME
as there are thousands of Chinese characters for inputting
while only 26 letter keys are available in the keyboard.
An IME is an essential software interface that maps
Chinese characters into English letter combinations.
An efficient IME will largely improve
the user experience of
Chinese information processing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Nowadays most of Chinese IMEs are pinyin based.
Pinyin is originally designed as the
phonetic symbol of a Chinese character
(based on the standard modern Chinese, mandarin)
, using Latin letters as its syllable notation.
For example, the pinyin of the Chinese character “<span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\song</span>爱”(love)
is “ài”.
Most characters usually have unique pinyin representations,
while a few Chinese characters may be pronounced in several different ways,
so they may have multiple pinyin representations.
The advantage of pinyin IME is
that it only adopts the pronunciation perspective of Chinese characters
so that it is simple and easy to learn.
But there are only less than 500 pinyin syllables in standard modern Chinese,
compared with over 6,000 commonly used Chinese characters,
which leads to serious ambiguities for pinyin-to-character mapping.
Modern pinyin IMEs mostly use a “<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">sentence-based</span>”
decoding technique <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="A New Statistical Approach To Chinese Pinyin Input" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> to alleviate the ambiguities.
“<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Sentence based</span>” means that IME generates a
sequence of Chinese characters upon a sequence of pinyin inputs
with respect to certain statistical criteria.</p>
</div>

<div id="S1.SS2" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsection"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">1.2 </span>Typos and Chinese Spell Checking</h3>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Written in Chinese characters but not alphabets, spell checking for Chinese language is quite different from the same task for other languages.
Since Chinese characters are entered via IME,
those user-made typos
do not immediately lead to spelling errors.
When a user types a wrong letter,
IME will be very likely to fail to generate the expected
Chinese character sequence.
Normally, the user may immediately notice the inputting error
and then make corrections,
which usually means doing a bunch of
extra operations like
cursor movement, deletion and re-typing.
Thus there are two separated sub-tasks for
Chinese spell checking:
1. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">typo checking</span>
for user typed pinyin sequences
which should be
a built-in module in IME,
and 2. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">spell checking</span>
for Chinese texts
in its narrow sense,
which is typically a module
of word processing applications <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib137" title="Spell Checking for Chinese" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
These two terms are often confused
especially in IME related works such as
<cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="A New Statistical Approach To Chinese Pinyin Input" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>
and <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib153" title="Systems and Methods for Translating Chinese Pinyin to Chinese Characters" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Pinyin typos have always been a serious problem for Chinese pinyin IMEs.
The user may fail to input the completely right pinyin simply because
he/she is a dialect speaker and does not know the exact pronunciation for the expected character.
This may be a very common situation
since there are about seven quite different dialects in Chinese,
among which being spoken languages,
six are far different from the standard modern Chinese, mandarin.
With the boom of smart-phones,
pinyin typos worsen
due to the limited size of soft keyboard,
and the lack of physical feedback on the touch screen.
However, existing practical IMEs only provide
small patches to deal with typos
such as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Fuzzy Pinyin</span> <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib173" title="Fault-tolerant Romanized Input Method for Non-roman Characters" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite>
and other language specific errors <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib147" title="Why Press Backspace? Understanding User Input Behaviors in Chinese Pinyin Input Method" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Typo checking and correction has an important impact on
IME performance.
When IME fails to correct a typo and generate the expected sentence,
the user will have to take much extra effort to move the cursor back to the mistyped letter
and correct it,
which leads to very poor user experience <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib155" title="KySS 1.0: a Framework for Automatic Evaluation of Chinese Input Method Engines" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The very first approach for Chinese input
with typo correction was made by <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="A New Statistical Approach To Chinese Pinyin Input" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>,
which was also the initial attempt of “sentence-based” IME.
The idea of “statistical input method” was proposed
by modeling PTC conversion as a hidden Markov model (HMM),
and using Viterbi <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib167" title="Error Bounds for Convolutional Codes and an Asymptotically Optimum Decoding Algorithm" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite> algorithm to decode the sequence.
They solved the typo correction problem by decomposing
the conditional probability <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S2.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P(H|P)" display="inline"><mrow><mi>P</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>|</mo><mi>P</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> of Chinese character sequence <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S2.p1.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="H" display="inline"><mi>H</mi></math>

a language model <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S2.p1.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P(w_{i}|w_{i-1})" display="inline"><mrow><mi>P</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>|</mo><msub><mi>w</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>
and a typing model <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S2.p1.m5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="P(p_{i}|w_{i})" display="inline"><mrow><mi>P</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>p</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>|</mo><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>.
The typing model that was estimated on real user input data was
for typo correction.
However, real user input data can be very noisy
and not very convenient to obtain.
As we will propose a joint model in this paper,
such an individual typing model is not necessarily built in our approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib165" title="CHIME: An Efficient Error-tolerant Chinese Pinyin Input Method" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite> developed an IME system
with typo correction called CHIME
using noisy channel error model and language-specific features.
However their model depended on a very strong assumption
that input pinyin sequence should have been segmented into pinyin words by the user.
This assumption does not really hold in modern “sentence-based” IMEs.
We release this assumption
since our model solves segmentation, typo correction and PTC conversion jointly.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The average length of pinyin syllables is about 3 letters.
There are about 410 pinyin syllables used in the current pinyin system.
Each pinyin syllable has a bunch of corresponding
Chinese characters which share the same
pronunciation represented by the syllable.
The number of those homophones ranges from 1 to over 300.
Chinese characters then form words.
But word in Chinese is a rather vague concept.
Without word delimiters,
linguists have argued on
what a Chinese word really is
for a long time
and that is why there is always
a primary word segmentation treatment
in most Chinese language processing tasks <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib175" title="An Improved Chinese Word Segmentation System with Conditional Random Field" class="ltx_ref">40</a>, <a href="#bib.bib180" title="Chinese Word Segmentation: A Decade Review" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib179" title="Exploiting Unlabeled Text with Different Unsupervised Segmentation Criteria for Chinese Word Segmentation" class="ltx_ref">41</a>, <a href="#bib.bib178" title="A Unified Character-Based Tagging Framework for Chinese Word Segmentation" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib177" title="Integrating Unsupervised and Supervised Word Segmentation: The Role of Goodness Measures" class="ltx_ref">42</a>, <a href="#bib.bib176" title="An Empirical Study on Word Segmentation for Chinese Machine Translation" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>.

<div id="S3.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Non-Chinese users may feel confused or even surprised if they know that
when typing pinyin through an IME,
Chinese IME users will never enter delimiters
such as “Space” key
to segment either pinyin syllables or pinyin words,
but just input the entire un-segmented
pinyin sequence.
For example, if one wants to
input “<span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\song</span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">你好世界 (Hello world)</span>”,
he will just type “<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">nihaoshijie</span>”
instead of segmented pinyin sequence “<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ni hao shi jie</span>”.
Nevertheless, pinyin syllable segmentation is a much easier
problem compared to Chinese word segmentation.
Since pinyin syllables have a very limited vocabulary
and follow a set of regularities strictly,
it is convenient to
perform pinyin syllable segmentation by using rules.
But as the pinyin input is not segmented,
it is nearly impossible to adopt
previous spell checking methods for English
to pinyin typo checking,
although techniques for English spell checking have been well developed.
A bit confusing but interesting,
pinyin typo correction and segmentation
come as two sides of one problem:
when a pinyin sequence is mistyped,
it is unlikely to be correctly segmented;
when it is segmented in an awkward way,
it is likely to be mistyped.</p>

This is the single source shortest path (SSSP) problem on DAG
which has an efficient algorithm
by preprocessing the DAG with topology sort,
then traversing vertices and edges in topological order.

For example, one intends to input “<span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\song</span><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">你好世界 (Hello world)</span>”
by typing “<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">nihaoshijie</span>”,

<p class="ltx_p">Merely using the above model, the typo correction result is not satisfying yet,
no matter how much effort is paid.
The major reason is that
the basic semantic unit of Chinese language is actually word (tough vaguely defined)
which is usually composed of several characters.
Thus the conditional probability between characters does not make much sense.
In addition, a pinyin syllable usually maps to dozens or even hundreds of corresponding homophonic characters,
which makes the conditional probability between syllables much more noisy.
However, using pinyin words instead of syllables is not a wise choice
because pinyin word segmentation is not so easy a task as syllable segmentation.
To make typo correction better,
we consider to integrate it with PTC conversion
using a joint model.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In this paper, we have developed
a joint graph model for pinyin-to-Chinese conversion
with typo correction.
This model finds a joint global optimal
for typo correction and PTC conversion
on the entire input pinyin sequence.
The evaluation results show that our model outperforms both previous academic systems and existing commercial products.
In addition, the joint model is efficient enough for practical use.</p>
