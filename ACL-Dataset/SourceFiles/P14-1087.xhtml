<p class="ltx_p">We study the use of temporal information in the form of timelines to enhance multi-document summarization.
We employ a fully automated temporal processing system to generate a timeline for each input document.
We derive three features from these timelines, and show that their use in supervised summarization lead to a significant 4.1% improvement in ROUGE performance over a state-of-the-art baseline.
In addition, we propose <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeMMR</span>, a modification to Maximal Marginal Relevance that promotes temporal diversity by way of
computing time span similarity, and show its utility in summarizing certain document sets.
We also propose a filtering metric to discard noisy timelines generated by our automatic processes, to purify the timeline input for summarization.
By selectively using timelines guided by filtering, overall summarization performance is increased by a significant 5.9%.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">There has been a good amount of research invested into improving the temporal interpretation of text.
Besides the increasing availability of annotation standards (e.g., <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeML</span> <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="TimeML: Robust Specification of Event and Temporal Expressions in Text" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>) and corpora (e.g., TIDES <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="Instruction Manual for the Annotation of Temporal Expressions" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, TimeBank <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="The TIMEBANK corpus" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>),
the community has also organized three successful evaluation workshops — TempEval-1 <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="The TempEval Challenge: Identifying Temporal Relations in Text" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>, -2 <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="SemEval-2010 Task 13: TempEval-2" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>, and -3 <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="SemEval-2013 Task 1: TEMPEVAL-3: Evaluating Time Expressions, Events, and Temporal Relations" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
As the state-of-the-art improves, these workshops have moved away from the piecemeal evaluation of individual temporal processing tasks and towards the evaluation of complete end-to-end systems in TempEval-3.
We believe our understanding of the temporal information found in text is sufficiently robust, and that there is an opportunity to now leverage this information in downstream applications.
In this paper, we present our work in incorporating the use of such temporal information into multi-document summarization.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The goal of multi-document summarization is to generate a summary which includes the main points from an input collection of documents with minimal repetition of similar points.
We hope to improve the quality of the summaries that are generated by considering temporal information found in the input text.
To motivate how temporal information can be useful in summarization, let us refer to Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exploiting Timelines to Enhance Multi-document Summarization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
The three sentences describe a recent cyclone and a previous one which happened in 1991. Recognizing that sentence (3) is about a storm that had happened in the past is important when writing a summary about the recent storm, as it is not relevant and can likely be excluded.</p>

<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is reasonable to expect that a collection of documents about the recent storm will contain more references to it, compared with the earlier one that happened in 1991.
Visualized on a timeline, this will translate to more events (bolded in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exploiting Timelines to Enhance Multi-document Summarization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) around the time when the recent storm occurred.
There should be fewer events mentioned in the collection for the earlier 1991 time period.
Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exploiting Timelines to Enhance Multi-document Summarization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> illustrates a possible timeline laid out with the events found in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exploiting Timelines to Enhance Multi-document Summarization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
The events from the more recent storm are found together at the same time.
There are fewer events which talk about the previous storm.
Thus, temporal information does assist in identifying which sentences are more relevant to the final summary.</p>

</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Our work is significant as it addresses an important gap in the exploitation of temporal information.
While there has been prior work making use of temporal information for multi-document summarization, they 1) have been largely confined to helping to chronologically order content within summaries <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="Information Fusion in the Context of Multi-document Summarization" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, or 2) focus only on the use of recency as an indicator of saliency <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="Multi-document Summarization by Sentence Extraction" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="TimedTextRank: Adding the Temporal Dimension to Multi-Document Summarization" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.
In this work we construct timelines (as a representation of temporal information) automatically and incorporate them into a state-of-the-art multi-document summarization system.
This is achieved with 1) three novel features derived from timelines to help measure the saliency of sentences, as well as 2) <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeMMR</span>, a modification to the traditional Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="The Use of MMR, Diversity-based Reranking for Reordering Documents and Producing Summaries" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
TimeMMR promotes diversity by additionally considering temporal information instead of just lexical similarities.
Through these, we demonstrate that temporal information is useful for multi-document summarization.
Compared to a competitive baseline, significant improvements of up to 4.1% are obtained.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Automatic temporal processing systems are not perfect yet, and this may have an impact on their use for downstream applications.
This work additionally proposes the use of the lengths of timelines as a metric to gauge the usefulness of timelines.
Together with the earlier described contributions, this metric further improves summarization, yielding an overall 5.9% performance increase.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><cite class="ltx_cite">Barzilay<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="Information Fusion in the Context of Multi-document Summarization" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>)</cite> were one of the first to use time for multi-document summarization.
They recognized the importance of generating a summary which presents the time perspective of the summarized documents correctly.
They estimated the chronological ordering of events with a small set of heuristics, and also made use of lexical patterns to perform basic time normalization on terms like “today” relative to the document creation time.
The induced ordering is used to present the selected summary content, following the chronological order in the original documents.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In another line of work, <cite class="ltx_cite">Goldstein<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="Multi-document Summarization by Sentence Extraction" class="ltx_ref">2000</a>)</cite> made use of the temporal ordering of documents to be summarized.
In computing the relevance of a passage for inclusion into the final summary, they considered the recency of the passage’s source document.
Passages from more recent documents are deemed to be more important.
<cite class="ltx_cite">Wan (<a href="#bib.bib19" title="TimedTextRank: Adding the Temporal Dimension to Multi-Document Summarization" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite">Demartini<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib20" title="Entity Summarization of News Articles" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> made similar assumptions in their work on <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimedTextRank</span> and entity summarization, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Instead of just considering the notion of recency, <cite class="ltx_cite">Liu<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib21" title="Extractive Summarization Based on Event Term Temporal Relation Graph and Critical Chain" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite> proposed an interesting approach using a temporal graph.
Events within a document set correspond to vertices in their proposed graph, while edges are determined by the temporal ordering of events.
From the resulting weakly-connected graph, the largest forests are assumed to contain key topics within the document set and used to influence a scoring mechanism which prefers sentences touching on these topics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><cite class="ltx_cite">Wu (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="Investigations on Temporal-Oriented Event-Based Extractive Summarization" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> also made use of the relative ordering of events.
He assigned complete timestamps to events extracted from text.
After laying out these events onto a timeline by making use of these timestamps, the number of events that
happen within the same day is used to influence sentence scoring.
The motivation behind this approach is that days which have a large number of events should be more important and more worthy of reporting than others.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">These prior works target either 1) sentence re-ordering, or 2) the use of recency as an indicator of saliency.
In sentence re-ordering, final summaries are re-arranged so that the extracted sentences that form the summary are in a chronological order.
We argue that this may not be appropriate for all summaries.
Depending on the style of writing or journalistic guidelines, a summary can arguably be written in a number of ways.
The use of recency as an indicator of saliency is useful, yet disregards other accessible temporal information.
If a summary of a whole sequence of events is desired, recency becomes less useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The work of <cite class="ltx_cite">Wu (<a href="#bib.bib34" title="Investigations on Temporal-Oriented Event-Based Extractive Summarization" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> is closely related to one of the features proposed in this paper.
He had also made use of temporal information to weight sentences to generate summaries.
However his approach is guided by the number of events happening within the same time span, and relies on event co-referencing.
In this work, we have simplified this idea by dropping the need for event co-referencing (removing a source of propagated error), and augmented it with two additional features derived from timelines.
By doing so, we are able to make better use of the available temporal information, taking into account all known events and the time in which they occur.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A useful note here is that this work is arguably different from the Temporal Summarization (TmpSum) track at the Text Retrieval Conference <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="TREC 2013 Temporal Summarization" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.
Given a large stream of data in real-time, the purpose of the TmpSum track is to look out for a query event, and retrieve specific details about the event over a period of time.
Systems are also expected to identify the source sentences from which these details are retrieved.
This is not the same as our approach here, which makes use of temporal information encoded in timelines to generate prose summaries.</p>

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">2. Contextual Time Span Importance (CTSI).</span> The importance of a time span may not depend solely on the number of events that happen within it.
If it is near time spans which are “important” (i.e., one that has a large number of events), it should also be of relative importance.
A more concrete illustration of this can also be seen in Figure <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exploiting Timelines to Enhance Multi-document Summarization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.
Sentence (2) explains that a lot of people have been evacuated prior to the cyclone making landfall.
It is imaginable that this can be useful information to be included in a summary,
even though from looking at the corresponding timeline in Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Exploiting Timelines to Enhance Multi-document Summarization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the “<em class="ltx_emph">evacuated</em>” event falls in a time span with a low importance score (i.e., the time span only has one event).

We first define the <em class="ltx_emph">temporal coverage</em> of a sentence.
This corresponds to the number of time spans that the events in a sentence talk about.
Suppose a sentence contains events which are associated with time spans <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S3.SS2.p6.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="TS_{a}" display="inline"><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>a</mi></msub></mrow></math>, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S3.SS2.p6.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="TS_{b}" display="inline"><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>b</mi></msub></mrow></math>, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S3.SS2.p6.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="TS_{c}" display="inline"><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>c</mi></msub></mrow></math>.
The time spans are ordered in the sequence they appear on the timeline.
Then the temporal coverage of a sentence is defined as the number of time spans between the earliest time span <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S3.SS2.p6.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="TS_{a}" display="inline"><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>a</mi></msub></mrow></math> and the latest time span <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S3.SS2.p6.m5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="TS_{c}" display="inline"><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>⁢</mo><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>c</mi></msub></mrow></math>.

<p class="ltx_p">The constraint on the number of sentences that can be included in a summary requires us to select compact sentences which contain as many relevant facts as possible.
Traditional lexical measures may attempt to achieve this by computing the ratio of keyphrases to the number of words in a sentence <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="Generic Text Summarization Using Relevance Measure and Latent Semantic Analysis" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>.
Stated equivalently, when two sentences are of the same length, if one contains more keyphrases, it should contain more useful facts.
TCD parallels this idea with the use of temporal information, i.e. if two sentences are of the same temporal coverage, then the one with more events should carry more useful facts.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Temporal processing is imperfect.
Together with the simplifying assumptions that were made in timeline construction, our generated timelines have errors which propagate into the summarization process.
With this in mind, we selectively employ timelines to generate summaries only when we are confident of their accuracy.
This can be done by computing a metric which can be used to decide whether or not timelines should be used for a particular input document collection.
We refer to this as <em class="ltx_emph">reliability filtering</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We postulate that the length of a timeline can serve as a simple reliability filtering metric.
The intuition for this is that for longer timelines (which contain more events), possible errors are spread over the entire timeline, and do not overpower any useful signal that can be obtained from the timeline features outlined earlier.
Errors are however very easily propagated into summary generation for shorter timelines, leading to less useful results.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We incorporate this into our process as follows: given an input
document collection (which consists of 10 documents), the average size
of all the timelines for each of these 10 documents is computed. Only when
this value is larger than a threshold value are the timelines used.</p>

We assume that the various input document sets to be summarized are available at the time of processing.
Hence in these experiments, the threshold for filtering is set to be the average of all the timeline sizes over the whole input dataset.
In a production environment where this assumption may not hold, this threshold could be set by empirical tuning over a development set.</p>

The same drop occurs even when reliability filtering is used (Rows 9 to 12).

The experimental results do not conclusively affirm the usefulness of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeMMR</span>.
However we believe it is because the ROUGE measures that are used for evaluation are not suited for this purpose.
Recall that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeMMR</span> seeks to eliminate redundancy based on time span similarities and not lexical likeness.
ROUGE, however, measures the latter.</p>

The summary on the left is generated using <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeMMR</span> and achieved a lower ROUGE score.
The one on the right is generated without <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeMMR</span> and scores higher, suggesting that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeMMR</span> is not helpful.
The key difference in the two summaries is (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}" display="inline"><mi>ℝ</mi></math>3).
(<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{L}" display="inline"><mi>𝕃</mi></math>3) is the equivalent of (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}" display="inline"><mi>ℝ</mi></math>4), while (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{L}" display="inline"><mi>𝕃</mi></math>4) is the full version of the truncated (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}" display="inline"><mi>ℝ</mi></math>5).
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeMMR</span> penalizes (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m6" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}" display="inline"><mi>ℝ</mi></math>3).
(<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m7" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}" display="inline"><mi>ℝ</mi></math>3) reports that the shoe-throwing incident happened as the U.S. President Bush appeared together with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
However their joint appearance is already reported in (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m8" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}" display="inline"><mi>ℝ</mi></math>1) (and similarly (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m9" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{L}" display="inline"><mi>𝕃</mi></math>1)).
(<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m10" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}" display="inline"><mi>ℝ</mi></math>3) repeats what had been presented earlier.
Since (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m11" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}" display="inline"><mi>ℝ</mi></math>1) and (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m12" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}" display="inline"><mi>ℝ</mi></math>3) talk about the same time span, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeMMR</span> down-weights (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.p6.m13" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathbb{R}" display="inline"><mi>ℝ</mi></math>3).
We argue that this is better even though the ROUGE scores indicate otherwise.
In future work it will be worthwhile to consider the use of metrics like Pyramid <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="Applying the Pyramid Method in DUC 2005" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> which are less bound to superficial lexicons.</p>

Table <a href="#S5.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 5 Discussion ‣ Exploiting Timelines to Enhance Multi-document Summarization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the effect of varying the filtering threshold on R-2 for the best performing configuration from Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4 Experiments and Results ‣ Exploiting Timelines to Enhance Multi-document Summarization" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> (i.e., <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">SWING</span>+TSI+CTSI+TCD).
The result obtained in Row 9 using a threshold of 42.68 is also re-produced for reference.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">T</span>=0 means that timelines are used for all input document sets,
whereas <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">T</span>=100
means that no timelines are used, as the length of the longest timeline is less than 100.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">As the threshold increases from 0 to 40–50, summarization performance improves while the
number of document sets where temporal information is used is reduced.
This suggests that filtering is successful in identifying timelines that are not sufficiently accurate to be useful for summarization.
R-2 performance peaks around a threshold of 40.
This affirms our use of the average length of timelines as the threshold value in our earlier experiments.
Beyond 60, the R-2 scores are still higher than that obtained by <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">SWING</span>, but no longer significantly different.
At these higher thresholds, temporal information is still able to help get an improvement in R-2.
However as this affects only very few out of the 44 document sets, statistical variances mean that these R-2 scores are no longer significant from that produced by <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">SWING</span>.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We have shown in this work how temporal information in the form of timelines can be incorporated into multi-document summarization.
We achieve this through two means, using: 1) three novel features derived from timelines to measure the saliency of sentences,
and 2) <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps">TimeMMR</span> which considers time span similarity to enhance the traditional MMR’s lexical diversity measure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">To overcome errors propagated from the underlying temporal processing systems, we proposed a reliability filtering metric which can be used to help decide when temporal information should be used for summarization.
The use of this metric leads to an overall 5.9% gain in R-2 over the competitive <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">SWING</span> baseline.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In future work, we are keen to study our proposed timeline-related features more intrinsically in the context of human-generated summaries. This can help us better understand their value in improving content selection.
As noted earlier, it will be also be useful to repeat our experiments with less lexicon-influenced measures like the Pyramid method <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="Applying the Pyramid Method in DUC 2005" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.
Manual assessment of the generated summaries can also be done to give a better picture of the quality of the summaries generated with the use of timelines.Â 
Finally, given the importance of reliability filtering, a natural question is if there are other metrics that can be used to get better results.</p>
