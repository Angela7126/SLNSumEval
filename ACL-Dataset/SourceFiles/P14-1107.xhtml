<p class="ltx_p">Crowdsourcing is a viable mechanism for creating training data for machine translation. It provides a low cost, fast turn-around way of processing large volumes of data. However, when compared to professional translation, naive collection of translations from non-professionals yields low-quality results. Careful quality control is necessary for crowdsourcing to work well. In this paper, we examine the challenges of a two-step collaboration process with translation and post-editing by non-professionals. We develop graph-based ranking models that automatically select the best output from multiple redundant versions of translations and edits, and improves translation quality closer to professionals.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Statistical machine translation (SMT) systems are trained using bilingual sentence-aligned parallel corpora. Theoretically, SMT can be applied to any language pair, but in practice it produces the state-of-art results only for language pairs with ample training data, like English-Arabic, English-Chinese, French-English, etc. SMT gets stuck in a severe bottleneck for many minority or ‘low resource’ languages with insufficient data.
This drastically limits which languages SMT can be successfully applied to.
Because of this, collecting parallel corpora for minor languages has become an interesting research challenge. There are various options for creating training data for new language pairs. Past approaches have examined harvesting translated documents from the web <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="The web as a parallel corpus" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="Large scale parallel document mining for machine translation" class="ltx_ref">36</a>, <a href="#bib.bib41" title="Dirt cheap web-scale parallel text from the Common Crawl" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>, or discovering parallel fragments from comparable corpora <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="Improving machine translation performance by exploiting non-parallel corpora" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib42" title="On the use of comparable corpora to improve SMT performance" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="Extracting parallel sentences from comparable corpora using document level alignment" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>.
Until relatively recently, little consideration has been given to creating parallel data from scratch. This is because the cost of hiring professional translators is prohibitively high. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite">Germann (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="Building a statistical machine translation system from scratch: how much bang for the buck can we expect?" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite> hoped to hire professional translators to create a modest sized 100,000 word Tamil-English parallel corpus, but were stymied by the costs and the difficulty of finding good translators for a short-term commitment.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Recently, crowdsourcing has opened the possibility of translating large amounts of text at low cost using non-professional translators. Facebook localized its web site into different languages using volunteers <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="Facebook taps users to create translated versions of site" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>. DuoLingo turns translation into an educational game, and translates web content using its language learners <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="Duolingo: learn a language for free while helping to translate the web" class="ltx_ref">37</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Rather than relying on volunteers or gamification, NLP research into crowdsourcing translation has focused on hiring workers on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="Fast, cheap, and creative: evaluating translation quality using amazon’s mechanical turk" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This setup presents unique challenges, since it typically involves non-professional translators whose language skills are varied, and since it sometimes involves participants who try to cheat to get the small financial reward <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="Crowdsourcing translation: professional quality from non-professionals" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>.
A natural approach for trying to shore up the skills of weak bilinguals is to pair them with a native speaker of the target language to edit their translations.
We review relevant research from NLP and human-computer interaction (HCI) on collaborative translation processes in Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Related work ‣ Are Two Heads Better than One? Crowdsourced Translation via a  Two-Step Collaboration of Non-Professional Translators and Editors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
To sort good translations from bad, researchers often solicit multiple, redundant translations and then build models to try to predict which translations are the best, or which translators tend to produce the highest quality translations.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In the HCI community, several researchers have proposed protocols for collaborative translation efforts <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib36" title="Designing protocols for collaborative translation" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib35" title="Collaborative translation by monolinguals with machine translators" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="Collaborative translation by monolingual users" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="Translation by iterative collaboration between monolingual users" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. These have focused on an iterative collaboration between monolingual speakers of the two languages, facilitated with a machine translation system.
These studies are similar to ours in that they rely on native speakers’ understanding of the target language to correct the disfluencies in poor translations. In our setup the poor translations are produced by bilingual individuals who are weak in the target language, and in their experiments the translations are the output of a machine translation system.<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup>A variety of HCI and NLP studies have confirmed the efficacy of monolingual or bilingual individuals post-editing of machine translation output <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="Linear B system description for the 2005 NIST MT evaluation exercise" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib38" title="Enabling monolingual translators: post-editing vs. options" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib37" title="The efficacy of human post-editing for language translation" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Past NLP work has also examined automatic post-editing<cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="Automated postediting of documents" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.</span></span></span></p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Another significant difference is that the HCI studies assume cooperative participants. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite">Hu<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib32" title="Translation by iterative collaboration between monolingual users" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> recruited volunteers from the International Children’s Digital Library <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib46" title="The international children’s digital library: viewing digital books online" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> who were all well intentioned and participated out a sense of altruism and to build a good reputation among the other volunteer translators at <a href="childrenslibrary.org" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_url"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">childrenslibrary.org</span></a>.
Our setup uses anonymous crowd workers hired on Mechanical Turk, whose motivation to participate is financial.
<cite class="ltx_cite">Bernstein<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="Soylent: a word processor with a crowd inside" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> characterized the problems with hiring editors via MTurk for a word processing application. Workers were either lazy (meaning they made only minimal edits) or overly zealous (meaning they made many unnecessary edits). <cite class="ltx_cite">Bernstein<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="Soylent: a word processor with a crowd inside" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> addressed this problem with a three step find-fix-verify process. In the first step, workers click on one word or phrase that needed to be corrected. In the next step, a separate group of workers proposed corrections to problematic regions that had been identified by multiple workers in the first pass. In the final step, other workers would validate whether the proposed corrections were good.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Most NLP research into crowdsourcing has focused on Mechanical Turk, following pioneering work by <cite class="ltx_cite">Snow<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="Cheap and fast—but is it good?: evaluating non-expert annotations for natural language tasks" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> who showed that the platform was a viable way of collecting data for a wide variety of NLP tasks at low cost and in large volumes. They further showed that non-expert annotations are similar to expert annotations when many non-expert labelings for the same input are aggregated, through simple voting or through weighting votes based on how closely non-experts matched experts on a small amount of calibration data. MTurk has subsequently been widely adopted by the NLP community and used for an extensive range of speech and language applications <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="Creating speech and language data with Amazon’s Mechanical Turk" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Although hiring professional translators to create bilingual training data for machine translation systems has been deemed infeasible, Mechanical Turk has provided a low cost way of creating large volumes of translations <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="Fast, cheap, and creative: evaluating translation quality using amazon’s mechanical turk" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="Can crowds build parallel corpora for machine translation systems?" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. For instance, <cite class="ltx_cite">Zbib<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="Machine translation of Arabic dialects" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="Systematic comparison of professional and crowdsourced reference translations for machine translation" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite> translated 1.5 million words of Levine Arabic and Egyptian Arabic, and showed that a statistical translation system trained on the dialect data outperformed a system trained on 100 times more MSA data. <cite class="ltx_cite">Post<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="Constructing parallel corpora for six Indian languages via crowdsourcing" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> used MTurk to create parallel corpora for six Indian languages for less than $0.01 per word. MTurk workers translated more than half a million words worth of Malayalam in less than a week. Several researchers have examined the use of active learning to further reduce the cost of translation <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="Active learning and crowd-sourcing for machine translation." class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="Active learning and crowdsourcing for machine translation in low resource scenarios" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="Large-scale cost-focused active learning for statistical machine translation" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Crowdsourcing allowed real studies to be conducted whereas most past active learning were simulated. <cite class="ltx_cite">Pavlick<span class="ltx_text ltx_bib_etal"> et al.</span> (<a href="#bib.bib28" title="The language demographics of Amazon Mechanical Turk" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> conducted a large-scale demographic study of the languages spoken by workers on MTurk by translating 10,000 words in each of 100 languages. <cite class="ltx_cite">Chen and Dolan (<a href="#bib.bib27" title="Building a persistent workforce on mechanical turk for multilingual data collection" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> examined the steps necessary to build a persistent multilingual workforce on MTurk.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">This paper is most closely related to previous work by <cite class="ltx_cite">Zaidan and Callison-Burch (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="Crowdsourcing translation: professional quality from non-professionals" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>, who showed that non-professional translators could approach the level of professional translators. They solicited multiple redundant translations from different Turkers for a collection of Urdu sentences that had been previously professionally translated by the Linguistics Data Consortium. They built a model to try to predict on a sentence-by-sentence and Turker-by-Turker which was the best translation or translator. They also hired US-based Turkers to edit the translations, since the translators were largely based in Pakistan and exhibited errors that are characteristic of speakers of English as a language. <cite class="ltx_cite">Zaidan and Callison-Burch (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="Crowdsourcing translation: professional quality from non-professionals" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> observed only modest improvements when incorporating these edited translation into their model.

<p class="ltx_p">We conduct our experiments using the data collected by <cite class="ltx_cite">Zaidan and Callison-Burch (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="Crowdsourcing translation: professional quality from non-professionals" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>. This data set consists 1,792 Urdu sentences from a variety of news and online sources, each paired with English translations provided by non-professional translators on Mechanical Turk.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS0.SSS0.P1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Each Urdu sentence was translated redundantly by 3 distinct translators, and each translation was edited by 3 separate (native English-speaking) editors to correct for grammatical and stylistic errors. In total, this gives us 12 non-professional English candidate sentences (3 unedited, 9 edited) per original Urdu sentence. 52 different Turkers took part in the translation task, each translating 138 sentences on average. In the editing task, 320 Turkers participated, averaging 56 sentences each. For comparison, the data also includes 4 different reference translations for each source sentence, produced by professional translators.</p>

The translations provided by translators on MTurk are generally done conscientiously, preserving the meaning of the source sentence, but typically contain simple mistakes like misspellings, typos, and awkward word choice. English-speaking editors, despite having no knowledge of the source language, are able to fix these errors. In this work, we show that the collaboration design of two heads– non-professional Urdu translators and non-professional English editors– yields better translated output than would either one working in isolation, and can better approximate the quality of professional translators.</p>

Therefore, each number reported in our experimental results is an average of four numbers, corresponding to the four possible ways of choosing 3 of the 4 reference sets.

<p class="ltx_p">As a naive baseline, we choose one candidate translation at random for each input Urdu sentence. To establish an upper bound for our methods, and to determine if there exist high-quality Turker translations at all, we compute four oracle scores. The first oracle operates at the segment level on the sentences produced by translators only: for each source segment, we choose from the translations the one that scores highest (in terms of BLEU) against the reference sentences. The second oracle is applied similarly, but chooses from the candidates produced by the collaboration of translator/post-editor pairs. The third oracle operates at the worker level: for each source segment, we choose from the translations the one provided by the worker whose translations (over all sentences) score the highest on average. The fourth oracle also operates at the worker level, but selects from sentences produced by translator/post-editor collaborations. These oracle methods represent ideal solutions under our scenario. We also examine two voting-inspired methods. The first method selects the translation with the minimum average TER <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="A study of translation edit rate with targeted human annotation" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> against the other translations; intuitively, this would represent the “consensus” translation. The second method selects the translation generated by the Turker who, on average, provides translations with the minimum average TER.</p>

As expected, random selection yields bad performance, with a BLEU score of 30.52. The oracles indicate that there is usually an acceptable translation from the Turkers for any given sentence. Since the oracles select from a small group of only 4 translations per source segment, they are not overly optimistic, and rather reflect the true potential of the collected translations. On average, the reference translations give a score of 42.38. To put this in perspective, the output of a state-of-the-art machine translation system (the syntax-based variant of Joshua) achieves a score of 26.91, which is reported in <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="Crowdsourcing translation: professional quality from non-professionals" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>.

Crowdsourced Translation via a  Two-Step Collaboration of Non-Professional Translators and Editors" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>). Small <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.SS3.SSS0.P4.p1.m6" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda" display="inline"><mi>λ</mi></math> values place little emphasis on the candidate/Turker coupling, whereas larger values rely more heavily on the co-ranking. Overall, we observed better performance with values within the range of 0.05-0.15. This suggests that both sources of information– the candidate itself and its authors– are important for the crowdsourcing translation task. In all of our reported results, we used the <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.SS3.SSS0.P4.p1.m7" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\lambda" display="inline"><mi>λ</mi></math> = 0.1.</p>

<div id="S5.SS3.SSS0.P5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We examine the relative contribution of each component of our approach on the overall performance. We first examine the centroid-based ranking on the candidate sub-graph (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.SS3.SSS0.P5.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G_{C}" display="inline"><msub><mi>G</mi><mi>C</mi></msub></math>) alone to see the effect of voting among translated sentences; we denote this strategy as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">plain ranking</span>. Then we incorporate the standard random walk on the Turker graph (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.SS3.SSS0.P5.p1.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G_{T}" display="inline"><msub><mi>G</mi><mi>T</mi></msub></math>) to include the structural information but without yet including any collaboration information; that is, we incorporate information from <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.SS3.SSS0.P5.p1.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G_{T}" display="inline"><msub><mi>G</mi><mi>T</mi></msub></math> and <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S5.SS3.SSS0.P5.p1.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G_{C}" display="inline"><msub><mi>G</mi><mi>C</mi></msub></math> without including edges linking the two together. The co-ranking paradigm is exactly the same as the framework described in Section 3.2, but with simplified structures.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS3.SSS0.P5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Finally, we examine the two-step collaboration based candidate-Turker graph using several variations on edge establishment. As before, the nodes are the translator/post-editor working pairs. We investigate three settings in which 1) edges connect two nodes when they share only a translator, 2) edges connect two nodes when they share only a post-editor, and 3) edges connect two nodes when they share either a translator or a post-editor.

<p class="ltx_p">Interestingly, we observe that when modeling the linkage between the collaboration pairs, connecting Turker pairs which share either a translator or the post-editor achieves better performance than connecting pairs that share only translators or connecting pairs which share only editors. This result supports the intuition that a denser collaboration matrix will help propagate saliency to good translators/post-editors and hence provides better predictions for candidate quality.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We have proposed an algorithm for using a two-step collaboration between non-professional translators and post-editors to obtain professional-quality translations. Our method, based on a co-ranking model, selects the best crowdsourced translation from a set of candidates, and is capable of selecting translations which near professional quality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Crowdsourcing can play a pivotal role in future efforts to create parallel translation datasets. In addition to its benefits of cost and scalability, crowdsourcing provides access to languages that currently fall outside the scope of statistical machine translation research. In future work on crowdsourced translation, further benefits in quality improvement and cost reduction could stem from 1) building ground truth data sets based on high-quality Turkers’ translations and 2) identifying when sufficient data has been collected for a given input, to avoid soliciting unnecessary redundant translations.</p>
