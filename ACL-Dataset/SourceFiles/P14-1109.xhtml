<p class="ltx_p">Earnings call summarizes the financial performance of a company,
and it is an important indicator of the future financial risks of the company.
We quantitatively study how earnings calls are correlated with the financial risks,
with a special focus on the financial crisis of 2009.
In particular, we perform a text regression task: given the transcript of an earnings call,
we predict the volatility of stock prices from the week after the call is made.
We propose the use of <em class="ltx_emph">copula</em>: a powerful statistical framework that
separately models the uniform marginals and their complex multivariate stochastic dependencies, while
not requiring any prior assumptions on the distributions of the covariate and the dependent variable.
By performing <em class="ltx_emph">probability integral transform</em>,
our approach moves beyond the standard count-based bag-of-words models in NLP,
and improves previous work on text regression by incorporating the correlation among local features in the form of semiparametric Gaussian copula.
In experiments, we show that our model significantly outperforms strong linear and non-linear discriminative baselines on three datasets under various settings.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Predicting the risks of publicly listed companies is of great interests not only to the
traders and analysts on the Wall Street, but also virtually
anyone who has investments in the market <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib127" title="Predicting risk from financial reports with regression" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>.
Traditionally, analysts focus on quantitative modeling
of historical trading data.
Today, even though earnings calls transcripts
are abundantly available, their distinctive communicative practices <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="Earnings calls: exploring an emerging financial reporting genre" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>,
and correlations with the financial risks,
in particular, future stock performances <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="Earnings conference calls and stock returns: the incremental informativeness of textual tone" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>,
are not well studied in the past.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Earnings calls are conference calls where a listed company
discusses the financial performance. Typically, a earnings call contains two parts:
the senior executives first
report the operational outcomes, as well as the current financial performance,
and then discuss their perspectives on the future of the company.
The second part of the teleconference
includes a question answering session where the floor will be open to investors, analysts,
and other parties for inquiries. The question we ask is that, even though each earnings call
has distinct styles, as well as different speakers and mixed formats, can we use earnings calls
to predict the financial risks of the company in the limited future?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Given a piece of earnings call transcript,
we investigate a semiparametric approach for automatic prediction of future financial
risk<span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup>In this work, the risk is defined as the measured volatility of stock prices from the week following the earnings call teleconference.

To do this, we formulate the problem as a text regression task, and
use a Gaussian copula with probability integral transform
to model the uniform marginals and their dependencies.
Copula models <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="Probabilistic metric spaces" class="ltx_ref">37</a>, <a href="#bib.bib113" title="An introduction to copulas" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>

among random variables,
but they are very new to the machine learning <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="Copula-based kernel dependency measures" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="Coda: high dimensional copula discriminant analysis" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="Collective inference for network data with copula latent markov networks" class="ltx_ref">44</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="Gaussian process vine copulas for multivariate dependence" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>
and related communities <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="Copulas for information retrieval" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
To the best of our knowledge, even though the term “copula”
is named for the resemblance to grammatical copulas in linguistics,
copula models have not been explored in the NLP community.
To evaluate the performance of our approach,
we compare with a standard squared loss linear regression baseline,
as well as strong baselines such as linear and non-linear support vector machines (SVMs)
that are widely used in text regression tasks.
By varying different experimental settings on three datasets concerning different periods of the Great Recession from 2006-2013,
we empirically show that our approach significantly outperforms the baselines by a wide margin.

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Fung et al. <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="Stock prediction: integrating text mining approach using real-time news" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> are among the first to study
SVM and text mining methods in the market prediction domain,
where they align financial news articles with multiple time series
to simulate the 33 stocks in the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index.
However, text regression in the financial domain have not been explored
until recently.
Kogan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib127" title="Predicting risk from financial reports with regression" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>
model the SEC-mandated annual reports, and performs linear SVM regression
with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S2.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\epsilon" display="inline"><mi>ϵ</mi></math>-insensitive loss function to predict the measured volatility.
Another recent study <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="Financial sentiment analysis for risk prediction" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite> uses exactly the same
max-margin regression technique, but with a different focus on the financial sentiment.
Using the same dataset, Tsai and Wang <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="Risk ranking from financial reports" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> reformulate the regression problem
as a text ranking problem.
Note that all these regression studies above investigate the SEC-mandated annual reports,
which are very different from the earnings calls in many aspects such as length, format, vocabulary, and genre.
Most recently, Xie et al. <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="Semantic frames to predict stock price movement" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> have proposed the use of
frame-level semantic features to understand financial news, but they treat the stock movement
prediction problem as a binary classification task.
Broadly speaking, our work is also aligned to recent studies
that make use of social media data to predict the stock market <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="Twitter mood predicts the stock market" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="Predicting stock market indicators through twitter “i hope it is not as bad as i fear”" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Despite our financial domain, our approach is more relevant
to text regression. Traditional discriminative models, such as
linear regression and linear SVM, have been very popular
in various text regression tasks, such as predicting movie revenues from reviews <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib126" title="Movie reviews and revenues: an experiment in text regression" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>,
understanding the geographic lexical variation <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="A latent variable model for geographic lexical variation" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>,
and predicting food prices from menus <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib124" title="Word salad: relating food prices and descriptions" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.
The advantage of these models is that the estimation of the parameters is often simple,
the results are easy to interpret, and the approach often yields strong performances.
While these approaches have merits, they suffer from the problem
of not explicitly modeling the correlations and interactions among random variables,
which in some sense, corresponding to the impractical assumption of
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) of the data.
For example, when bag-of-word-unigrams are present in the feature space,
it is easier if one does not explicitly model the stochastic dependencies among the words,
even though doing so might hurt the predictive power,
while the variance from the correlations among the random variables is not explained.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In NLP, many statistical machine learning methods that capture the dependencies among random variables,
including topic models <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="Latent dirichlet allocation" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib117" title="Correlated topic models" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib116" title="Historical analysis of legal opinions with a sparse mixed-effects latent variable model" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite>, always have to make assumptions with the underlying
distributions of the random variables, and make use of informative priors.
This might be rather restricting the expressiveness of the model in some sense <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="Spherical topic models" class="ltx_ref">36</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, once such assumptions are removed,
another problem arises — they might be prone to errors, and suffer from the overfitting issue.
Therefore, coping with the tradeoff between expressiveness and overfitting, seems to be rather important in statistical
approaches that capture stochastic dependency.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Our proposed semiparametric copula regression model
takes a different perspective.
On one hand, copula models <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib113" title="An introduction to copulas" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>
seek to explicitly model the dependency of random variables
by separating the marginals and their correlations.
On the other hand, it does not make use of any assumptions
on the distributions of the random variables, yet,
the copula model is still expressive.
This nice property essentially allows us to fuse
distinctive lexical, syntactic, and semantic feature sets naturally into a single compact model.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">From an information-theoretic point of view <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="A mathematical theory of communication" class="ltx_ref">38</a>]</cite>,
various problems in text analytics can be formulated as
estimating the probability mass/density functions of tokens in text.
In NLP, many of the probabilistic text models
work in the discrete space <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="Poisson mixtures." class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib118" title="Latent dirichlet allocation" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>,
but our model is different:
since the text features are sparse, we first perform
kernel density estimates to smooth out the zeroing items,
and then calculate the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variables.
By doing this, we are essentially performing <em class="ltx_emph">probability integral transform</em>—
an important statistical technique that moves beyond the count-based bag-of-words feature space
to marginal cumulative density functions space.
Last but not least,
by using a parametric copula, in our case, the Gaussian copula,
we reduce the computational cost from fully nonparametric methods,
and explicitly model the correlations among the covariate and the dependent
variable.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">In this section, we first briefly look at the theoretical foundations of copulas,

<div id="S3.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In the statistics literature, copula is widely known as a family of distribution function.
The idea behind copula theory is that the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of a random vector can be represented in the form of uniform marginal
cumulative distribution functions, and a copula that connects these marginal CDFs,
which describes the correlations among the input random variables.
However, in order to have a valid multivariate distribution function regardless of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S3.SS1.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math>-dimensional
covariates, not every function can be used as a copula function.
The central idea behind copula, therefore, can be summarize by the Sklar’s theorem
and the corollary.</p>

instead of using the classic bag-of-words representation that uses raw counts,

focusing on the period of the Great Recession.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The <em class="ltx_emph">pre-2009</em> dataset consists of earnings calls from the period of 2006-2008,
which includes calls from the beginning of economic downturn, the outbreak of the subprime mortgage crisis,
and the epidemic of collapses of large financial institutions.
The <em class="ltx_emph">2009</em> dataset contains earnings calls from the year of 2009,
which is a period where the credit crisis spreads globally,
and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit the lowest since the beginning
of the millennium. The <em class="ltx_emph">post-2009</em> dataset includes earnings calls from the period of
2010 to 2013, which concerns the recovery of global economy.
The detailed statistics is shown in Table <a href="#S4.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 4 Datasets ‣ A Semiparametric Gaussian Copula Regression Model for Predicting Financial Risks from Earnings Calls" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Note that unlike the standard news corpora in NLP
or the SEC-mandated financial report,
Transcripts of earnings call is a very special genre of text.
For example, the length of WSJ documents
is typically one to three hundreds <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="Overview of the second text retrieval conference (trec-2)" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>,
but the averaged document length of our three earnings calls datasets is 7677.
Depending on the amount of interactions in the question answering session,
the complexities of the calls vary.
This mixed form of formal statement and informal speech brought difficulties to machine learning
algorithms.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In the first experiment, we compare the proposed semiparametric Gaussian copula regression model
to three baselines on three datasets with all features. The detailed results are shown in Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ A Semiparametric Gaussian Copula Regression Model for Predicting Financial Risks from Earnings Calls" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
On the <em class="ltx_emph">pre-2009</em> dataset, we see that the linear regression and linear SVM perform reasonably well,
but the Gaussian kernel SVM performs less well, probably due to overfitting.
The copula model outperformed all three baselines by a wide margin on this dataset with both metrics.
Similar performances are also obtained in the <em class="ltx_emph">2009</em> dataset, where the result of linear SVM baseline falls behind.
On the <em class="ltx_emph">post-2009</em> dataset, none of results from the linear and non-linear SVM models can match up with
the linear regression model, but our proposed copula model still improves over all baselines by a large margin.
Comparing to second-best approaches, all improvements obtained by the copula model are statistically significant.</p>

<div id="S6.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">To understand the learning curve of our proposed copula regression model,
we use the 25%, 50%, 75% subsets from the training data, and evaluate all four models.
Figure <a href="#S6.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ A Semiparametric Gaussian Copula Regression Model for Predicting Financial Risks from Earnings Calls" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows the evaluation results.
From the experiments on the <em class="ltx_emph">pre-2009</em> dataset, we see that
when the amount of training data is small (25%), both SVM models have obtained
very impressive results.
This is not surprising at all, because as max-margin models, soft-margin SVM
only needs a handful of examples that come with nonvanishing coefficients (support vectors)
to find a reasonable margin. When increasing the amount of training data to 50%,
we do see the proposed copula model catches up quickly,
and lead all baseline methods undoubtably at 75% training data.
On the <em class="ltx_emph">2009</em> dataset, we observe very similar patterns.
Interestingly, the proposed copula regression
model has dominated all methods for both metrics throughout all proportions of the “post-2009” earnings calls dataset,
where instead of financial crisis, the economic recovery is the main theme.
In contrast to the previous two datasets, both linear and non-linear SVMs fail
to reach reasonable performances on this dataset.</p>

<div id="S6.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Finally, we investigate the robustness of the proposed semiparametric Gaussian copula regression model by varying the amount of features in the covariate space. To do this, we sample equal amount of features from each feature set, and concatenate them into a feature vector. When increasing the amount of total features from 100 to 400, the results are shown in Figure <a href="#S6.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ A Semiparametric Gaussian Copula Regression Model for Predicting Financial Risks from Earnings Calls" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>.
On the <em class="ltx_emph">pre-2009</em> dataset, we see that the gaps between the best-perform copula model and the second-best linear regression model are consistent throughout all feature sizes.
On the <em class="ltx_emph">2009</em> dataset, we see that the performance of Gaussian copula is aligned with the linear regression model
in terms of Spearman’s correlation, where the former seems to perform better in terms of Kendall’s tau.
Both linear and non-linear SVM models do not have any advantages over the proposed approach.
On the <em class="ltx_emph">post-2009</em> dataset that concerns economic growth and recovery,
the boundaries among all methods are very clear. The Spearman’s correlation for both SVM baselines
is less than 0.15 throughout all settings, but copula model is able to achieve 0.4 when using 400 features.
The improvements of copula model over squared loss linear regression model are increasing,
when working with larger feature spaces.</p>

</div>
<div id="S6.SS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Like linear classifiers, by “opening the hood” to the Gaussian copula
regression model, one can examine features that exhibit high correlations
with the dependent variable.
Table <a href="#S6.T3" title="Table 3 ‣ 6.5 Qualitative Analysis ‣ 6 Experiments ‣ A Semiparametric Gaussian Copula Regression Model for Predicting Financial Risks from Earnings Calls" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> shows the top features that are positively correlated
with the future stock volatility in the three datasets.
On the top features from the “pre-2009” dataset, which primarily (82%) includes calls from 2008,
we can clearly observe that the word “2008” has strong correlation with the financial risks.
Interestingly, the phrase “third quarter” and its variations, not only play an important role in the model,
but also highly correlated to the timeline of the financial crisis:
the Q3 of 2008 is a critical period in the recession, where
Lehman Brothers falls on the Sept. 15 of 2008, filing
$613 billion of debt — the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="Lehman folds with record $613 billion debt" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.
This huge panic soon broke out in various financial institutions in the Wall Street.
On the top features from “2009” dataset, again,
we see the word “2008” is still prominent in predicting financial risks,
indicating the hardship and extended impacts from the center of the economic crisis.
After examining the transcripts, we found sentences like:
“<em class="ltx_emph">…our specialty lighting business that we discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2008…</em>”,
“<em class="ltx_emph">…the exception of fourth quarter revenue which was $100,000 below our guidance target…</em>”,
and “<em class="ltx_emph">…to address changing economic conditions and their impact on our operations, in the fourth quarter we took the painful but prudent step of decreasing our headcount by about 5%…</em>”,
showing the crucial role that Q4 of 2008 plays in 2009 earnings calls.
Interestingly, after the 2008-2009 crisis, in the recovery period,
we have observed new words like “revenue”, indicating the “back-to-normal” trend of financial environment,
and new features that predict financial volatility.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">7 </span>Discussions</h2>

<div id="S7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In the experimental section, we notice that the proposed semiparametric Gaussian copula model
has obtained promising results in various setups on three datasets in this text regression task.
The main questions we ask are: how is the proposed model different from standard text regression/classification models?
What are the advantages of copula-based models, and what makes it perform so well?</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">One advantage we see from the copula model is
that it does not require any assumptions on the marginal distributions.
For example, in latent Dirichlet allocation <cite class="ltx_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib118" title="Latent dirichlet allocation" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>,
the topic proportion of a document is always drawn from a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S7.p2.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="Dirichlet(\alpha)" display="inline"><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>α</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>
distribution. This is rather restricted, because the possible
shapes from a <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S7.p2.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K-1" display="inline"><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math> simplex of Dirichlet is always limited in some sense.
In our copula model, instead of using some priors,
we just calculate the empirical cumulative distribution function
of the random variables, and model the correlation among them.
This is extremely practical, because in many natural language processing tasks,
we often have to deal with features that are extracted from many different domains and signals.
By applying the <em class="ltx_emph">Probability Integral Transform</em> to raw features in the copula model,
we essentially avoid comparing apples and oranges in the feature space,
which is a common problem in bag-of-features models in NLP.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The second hypothesis is about the semiparametirc parameterization,
which contains the nonparametric kernel density estimation and the
parametric Gaussian copula regression components. The benefit of
a semiparametric model is that here we are not interested in
performing completely nonparametric estimations, where the
infinite dimensional parameters might bring intractability.
In contrast, by considering the semiparametric case, we not only
obtain some expressiveness from the nonparametric models,
but also reduce the complexity of the task: we are
only interested in the finite-dimensional components <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S7.p3.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Sigma" display="inline"><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></math> in the Gaussian copula with <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="S7.p3.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="O(n\log n)" display="inline"><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math> complexity,
which is not as computationally difficult as the completely nonparametric cases.
Also, by modeling the marginals and their correlations seperately,
our approach is cleaner, easy-to-understand, and
allows us to have more flexibility to model the uncertainty of data.
Our pilot experiment also aligns with our hypothesis:
when not performing the kernel density estimation part
for smoothing out the marginal distributions,
the performances dropped significantly when sparser
features are included.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The third advantage we observe is the power of modeling the covariance
of the random variables. Traditionally, in statistics,
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumptions among the instances
and the random variables are often used in various models,
such that the correlations among the instances or the variables are often ignored.
However, this might not be practical at all:
in image processing, the “cloud” pixel of a pixel showing the blue sky of a picture
are more likelihood to co-occur in the same picture;
in natural language processing, the word “mythical”
is more likely to co-occur with the word “unicorn”, rather than the word “popcorn”.
Therefore, by modeling the correlations among marginal CDFs,
the copula model has gained the insights on the dependency structures of the random variables,
and thus, the performance of the regression task is boosted.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In the future, we plan to apply the proposed approach to large datasets
where millions of features and millions of instances are involved.
Currently we have not experienced the difficulty when estimating
the Gaussian copula model, but parallel methods might be needed to speedup learning
when significantly more marginal CDFs are involved.
The second issue is about overfitting.
We see that when features are rather noisy,
we might need to investigate regularized copula models to avoid this.
Finally, we plan to extend the proposed approach to text classification
and structured prediction problems in NLP.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">8 </span>Conclusion</h2>

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In this work, we have demonstrated that
the more complex quarterly earnings calls can also be used to predict the measured volatility
of the stocks in the limited future.
We propose a novel semiparametric Gausian copula regression approach
that models the dependency structure of the language in the earnings calls.
Unlike traditional bag-of-features models that work discrete features from various signals,
we perform kernel density estimation to smooth out the distribution,
and use probability integral transform to work with CDFs that are uniform.
The copula model deals with marginal CDFs and the correlation among them separately,
in a cleaner manner that is also flexible to parameterize.
Focusing on the three financial crisis related datasets,
the proposed model significantly outperform the standard linear regression
method in statistics and strong discriminative support vector regression baselines.
By varying the size of the training data and the dimensionality of
the covariates, we have demonstrated that our proposed model
is relatively robust across different parameter settings.</p>
