   Entity clustering must determine when two named-entity mentions refer to the same entity.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Typical approaches use a pipeline architecture that clusters the mentions using fixed or learned measures of name and context similarity.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   In this paper, we propose a model for cross-document coreference resolution that achieves robustness by learning similarity from unlabeled data.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The generative process assumes that each entity mention arises from copying and optionally mutating an earlier name from a similar context.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Clustering the mentions into entities depends on recovering this copying tree jointly with estimating models of the mutation process and parent selection process.

   We present a block Gibbs sampler for posterior inference and an empirical evaluation on several datasets.
