   We study the problem of generating an English sentence given an underlying probabilistic grammar, a world and a communicative goal.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We model the generation problem as a Markov decision process with a suitably defined reward function that reflects the communicative goal.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We then use probabilistic planning to solve the MDP and generate a sentence that, with high probability, accomplishes the communicative goal.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We show empirically that our approach can generate complex sentences with a speed that generally matches or surpasses the state of the art.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Further, we show that our approach is anytime and can handle complex communicative goals, including negated goals.
