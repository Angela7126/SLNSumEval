   Chinese is an ancient hieroglyphic.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   It is inattentive to structure.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Therefore, segmenting and parsing Chinese are more difficult and less accurate.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In this paper, we propose an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method for Chinese relation extraction.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature, reducing errors caused by word segmentation.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   In order to utilize the structure information of a relation instance, we discuss how soft constraint can be used to capture the local dependency.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Both Omni-word feature and soft constraint make a better use of sentence information and minimize the influences caused by Chinese word segmentation and parsing.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   We test these methods on the ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   The results show a significant improvement in Chinese relation extraction, outperforming other methods in F-score by 10% in 6 relation types and 15% in 18 relation subtypes.
