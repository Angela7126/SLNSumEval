   We present a new approach to inducing the syntactic categories of words, combining their distributional and morphological properties in a joint nonparametric Bayesian model based on the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The prior distribution over word clusterings uses a log-linear model of morphological similarity; the likelihood function is the probability of generating vector word embeddings.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The weights of the morphology model are learned jointly while inducing part-of-speech clusters, encouraging them to cohere with the distributional features.
  </a>

   The resulting algorithm outperforms competitive alternatives on English POS induction.
