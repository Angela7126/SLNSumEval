   Discussion forums have evolved into a dependable source of knowledge to solve common problems.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   However, only a minority of the posts in discussion forums are solution posts.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Identifying solution posts from discussion forums, hence, is an important research problem.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In this paper, we present a technique for unsupervised solution post identification leveraging a so far unexplored textual feature, that of lexical correlations between problems and solutions.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We use translation models and language models to exploit lexical correlations and solution post character respectively.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Our technique is designed to not rely much on structural features such as post metadata since such features are often not uniformly available across forums.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Our clustering-based iterative solution identification approach based on the EM-formulation performs favorably in an empirical evaluation, beating the only unsupervised solution identification technique from literature by a very large margin.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   We also show that our unsupervised technique is competitive against methods that require supervision, outperforming one such technique comfortably.
