  <a href="#1" id="1">
   This paper aims at extracting new sentiment words from large-scale user-generated content.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We propose a fully unsupervised, purely data-driven framework for this purpose.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We design statistical measures respectively to quantify the utility of a lexical pattern and to measure the possibility of a word being a new word.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The method is almost free of linguistic resources (except POS tags), and requires no elaborated linguistic rules.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   We also demonstrate how new sentiment word will benefit sentiment analysis.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
