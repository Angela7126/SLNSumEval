   We develop a semantic parsing framework based on semantic similarity for open domain question answering (QA.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We focus on single-relation questions and decompose each question into an entity mention and a relation pattern.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Using convolutional neural network models, we measure the similarity of entity mentions with entities in the knowledge base (KB) and the similarity of relation patterns and relations in the KB.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We score relational triples in the KB using these measures and select the top scoring relational triple to answer the question.
  </a>

   When evaluated on an open-domain QA task, our method achieves higher precision across different recall points compared to the previous approach, and can improve F 1 by 7 points.
