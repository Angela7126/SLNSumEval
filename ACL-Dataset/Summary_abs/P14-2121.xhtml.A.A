   This paper presents the first computationally-derived scalar measurement of metaphoricity.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Each input sentence is given a value between 0 and 1 which represents how metaphoric that sentence is.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   This measure achieves a correlation of 0.450 (Pearson s R, p 0.01) with an experimental measure of metaphoricity involving human participants.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   While far from perfect, this scalar measure of metaphoricity allows different thresholds for metaphoricity so that metaphor identification can be fitted for specific tasks and datasets.

   When reduced to a binary classification evaluation using the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, the system achieves an F-Measure of 0.608, slightly lower than the comparable binary classification system s 0.638 and competitive with existing approaches.
