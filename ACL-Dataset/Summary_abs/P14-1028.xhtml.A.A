   Recently, neural network models for natural language processing tasks have been increasingly focused on for their ability to alleviate the burden of manual feature engineering.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model for Chinese word segmentation called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ).
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   By exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation, MMTNN has the ability to model complicated interactions between tags and context characters.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Furthermore, a new tensor factorization approach is proposed to speed up the model and avoid overfitting.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Experiments on the benchmark dataset show that our model achieves better performances than previous neural network models and that our model can achieve a competitive performance with minimal feature engineering.
  </a>

   Despite Chinese word segmentation being a specific case, MMTNN can be easily generalized and applied to other sequence labeling tasks.
