   Designing measures that capture various aspects of language ability is a central task in the design of systems for automatic scoring of spontaneous speech.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   In this study, we address a key aspect of language proficiency assessment syntactic complexity.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We propose a novel measure of syntactic complexity for spontaneous speech that shows optimum empirical performance on real world data in multiple ways.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   First, it is both robust and reliable , producing automatic scores that agree well with human rating compared to the state-of-the-art.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Second, the measure makes sense theoretically, both from algorithmic and native language acquisition points of view.
