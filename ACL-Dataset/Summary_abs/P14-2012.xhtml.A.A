   Relation extraction suffers from a performance loss when a model is applied to out-of-domain data.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   This has fostered the development of domain adaptation techniques for relation extraction.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   This paper evaluates word embeddings and clustering on adapting feature-based relation extraction systems.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We systematically explore various ways to apply word embeddings and show the best adaptation improvement by combining word cluster and word embedding information.
  </a>

   Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of regularization for the adaptability of relation extractors.
