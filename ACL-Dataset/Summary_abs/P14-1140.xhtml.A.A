   In this paper, we propose a novel recursive recurrent neural network (R 2 NN) to model the end-to-end decoding process for statistical machine translation.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   R 2 NN is a combination of recursive neural network and recurrent neural network, and in turn integrates their respective capabilities.
  </a>

   1) new information can be used to generate the next hidden state, like recurrent neural networks, so that language model and translation model can be integrated naturally; (2) a tree structure can be built, as recursive neural networks, so as to generate the translation candidates in a bottom up manner.
  </a>

   A semi-supervised training approach is proposed to train the parameters, and the phrase pair embedding is explored to model translation confidence directly.

   Experiments on a Chinese to English translation task show that our proposed R 2 NN can outperform the state-of-the-art baseline by about 1.5 points in BLEU.
