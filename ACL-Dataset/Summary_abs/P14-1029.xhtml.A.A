   Negation words, such as no and not , play a fundamental role in modifying sentiment of textual expressions.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We will refer to a negation word as the negator and the text span within the scope of the negator as the argument.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Commonly used heuristics to estimate the sentiment of negated expressions rely simply on the sentiment of argument (and not on the negator or the argument itself).
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We use a sentiment treebank to show that these existing heuristics are poor estimators of sentiment.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We then modify these heuristics to be dependent on the negators and show that this improves prediction.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Next, we evaluate a recently proposed composition model [] that relies on both the negator and the argument.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   This model learns the syntax and semantics of the negator s argument with a recursive neural network.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   We show that this approach performs better than those mentioned above.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   In addition, we explicitly incorporate the prior sentiment of the argument and observe that this information can help reduce fitting errors.
