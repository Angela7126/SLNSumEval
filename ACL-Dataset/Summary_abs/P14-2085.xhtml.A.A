   This paper describes a new approach to predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context, i.e.,, whether a verb is used in a stative or dynamic sense.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We identify two challenging cases of this problem when the verb is unseen in training data, and when the verb is ambiguous for aspectual class.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   A semi-supervised approach using linguistically-motivated features and a novel set of distributional features based on representative verb types allows us to predict classes accurately, even for unseen verbs.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Many frequent verbs can be either stative or dynamic in different contexts, which has not been modeled by previous work; we use contextual features to resolve this ambiguity.

   In addition, we introduce two new datasets of clauses marked for aspectual class.
