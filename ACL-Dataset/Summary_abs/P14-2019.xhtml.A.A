   In this paper, we report our preliminary efforts in building an English-Turkish parallel treebank corpus for statistical machine translation.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   In the corpus, we manually generated parallel trees for about 5,000 sentences from Penn Treebank.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   English sentences in our set have a maximum of 15 tokens, including punctuation.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We constrained the translated trees to the reordering of the children and the replacement of the leaf nodes with appropriate glosses.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We also report the tools that we built and used in our tree translation task.
