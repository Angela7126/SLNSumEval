   With the proliferation of social media sites, social streams have proven to contain the most up-to-date information on current events.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Therefore, it is crucial to extract events from the social streams such as tweets.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   However, it is not straightforward to adapt the existing event extraction systems since texts in social media are fragmented and noisy.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In this paper we propose a simple and yet effective Bayesian model, called Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract structured representation of events from social media.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   LEM is fully unsupervised and does not require annotated data for training.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   We evaluate LEM on a Twitter corpus.
  </a>

   Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 83% in F-measure, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by over 7%.
