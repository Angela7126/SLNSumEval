   We present a novel technique for semantic frame identification using distributed representations of predicates and their syntactic context; this technique leverages automatic syntactic parses and a generic set of word embeddings.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Given labeled data annotated with frame-semantic parses, we learn a model that projects the set of word representations for the syntactic context around a predicate to a low dimensional representation.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The latter is used for semantic frame identification; with a standard argument identification method inspired by prior work, we achieve state-of-the-art results on FrameNet-style frame-semantic analysis.

   Additionally, we report strong results on PropBank-style semantic role labeling in comparison to prior work.
