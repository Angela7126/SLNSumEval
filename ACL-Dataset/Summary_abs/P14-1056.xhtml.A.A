   Accurately segmenting a citation string into fields for authors, titles, etc is a challenging task because the output typically obeys various global constraints.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Previous work has shown that modeling soft constraints , where the model is encouraged, but not require to obey the constraints, can substantially improve segmentation performance.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   On the other hand, for imposing hard constraints , dual decomposition is a popular technique for efficient prediction given existing algorithms for unconstrained inference.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We extend dual decomposition to perform prediction subject to soft constraints.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Moreover, with a technique for performing inference given soft constraints, it is easy to automatically generate large families of constraints and learn their costs with a simple convex optimization problem during training.

   This allows us to obtain substantial gains in accuracy on a new, challenging citation extraction dataset.
