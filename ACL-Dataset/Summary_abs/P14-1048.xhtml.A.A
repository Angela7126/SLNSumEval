   Text-level discourse parsing remains a challenge.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The current state-of-the-art overall accuracy in relation assignment is 55.73%, achieved by Joty et al. 2013.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   However, their model has a high order of time complexity, and thus cannot be applied in practice.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In this work, we develop a much faster model whose time complexity is linear in the number of sentences.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Our model adopts a greedy bottom-up approach, with two linear-chain CRFs applied in cascade as local classifiers.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   To enhance the accuracy of the pipeline, we add additional constraints in the Viterbi decoding of the first CRF.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   In addition to efficiency, our parser also significantly outperforms the state of the art.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Moreover, our novel approach of post-editing, which modifies a fully-built tree by considering information from constituents on upper levels, can further improve the accuracy.
