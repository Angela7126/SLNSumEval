   Latent topics derived by topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are the result of hidden thematic structures which provide further insights into the data.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The automatic labelling of such topics derived from social media poses however new challenges since topics may characterise novel events happening in the real world.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Existing automatic topic labelling approaches which depend on external knowledge sources become less applicable here since relevant articles/concepts of the extracted topics may not exist in external sources.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In this paper we propose to address the problem of automatic labelling of latent topics learned from Twitter as a summarisation problem.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We introduce a framework which apply summarisation algorithms to generate topic labels.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   These algorithms are independent of external sources and only rely on the identification of dominant terms in documents related to the latent topic.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   We compare the efficiency of existing state of the art summarisation algorithms.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Our results suggest that summarisation algorithms generate better topic labels which capture event-related context compared to the top- n terms returned by LDA.
