   Emotion lexicons play a crucial role in sentiment analysis and opinion mining.

   In this paper, we propose a novel Emotion-aware LDA (EaLDA) model to build a domain-specific lexicon for predefined emotions that include anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The model uses a minimal set of domain-independent seed words as prior knowledge to discover a domain-specific lexicon, learning a fine-grained emotion lexicon much richer and adaptive to a specific domain.

   By comprehensive experiments, we show that our model can generate a high-quality fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon.
