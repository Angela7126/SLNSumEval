   Sentiment analysis in a multilingual world remains a challenging problem, because developing language-specific sentiment lexicons is an extremely resource-intensive process.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Such lexicons remain a scarce resource for most languages.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   In this paper, we address this lexicon gap by building high-quality sentiment lexicons for 136 major languages.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We integrate a variety of linguistic resources to produce an immense knowledge graph.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   By appropriately propagating from seed words, we construct sentiment lexicons for each component language of our graph.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Our lexicons have a polarity agreement of 95.7% with published lexicons, while achieving an overall coverage of 45.2%.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   We demonstrate the performance of our lexicons in an extrinsic analysis of 2,000 distinct historical figures Wikipedia articles on 30 languages.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Despite cultural difference and the intended neutrality of Wikipedia articles, our lexicons show an average sentiment correlation of 0.28 across all language pairs.
