   This study investigates on building a better Chinese word segmentation model for statistical machine translation.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   It aims at leveraging word boundary information, automatically learned by bilingual character-based alignments, to induce a preferable segmentation model.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We propose dealing with the induced word boundaries as soft constraints to bias the continuous learning of a supervised CRFs model, trained by the treebank data (labeled), on the bilingual data (unlabeled.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The induced word boundary information is encoded as a graph propagation constraint.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The constrained model induction is accomplished by using posterior regularization algorithm.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   The experiments on a Chinese-to-English machine translation task reveal that the proposed model can bring positive segmentation effects to translation quality.
