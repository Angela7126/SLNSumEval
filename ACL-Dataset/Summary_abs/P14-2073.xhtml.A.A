   Previous research has established several methods of online learning for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   However, streaming learning for LDA allowing only one pass over the data and constant storage complexity is not as well explored.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We use reservoir sampling to reduce the storage complexity of a previously-studied online algorithm, namely the particle filter, to constant.

   We then show that a simpler particle filter implementation performs just as well, and that the quality of the initialization dominates other factors of performance.
