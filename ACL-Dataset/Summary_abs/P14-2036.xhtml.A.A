   In this paper, we propose a novel model for enriching the content of microblogs by exploiting external knowledge, thus improving the data sparseness problem in short text classification.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We assume that microblogs share the same topics with external knowledge.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We first build an optimization model to infer the topics of microblogs by employing the topic-word distribution of the external knowledge.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Then the content of microblogs is further enriched by relevant words from external knowledge.
  </a>

   Experiments on microblog classification show that our approach is effective and outperforms traditional text classification methods.
