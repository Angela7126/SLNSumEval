   We propose a novel approach to cross-lingual model transfer based on feature representation projection.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   First, a compact feature representation relevant for the task in question is constructed for either language independently and then the mapping between the two representations is determined using parallel data.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The target instance can then be mapped into the source-side feature representation using the derived mapping and handled directly by the source-side model.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   This approach displays competitive performance on model transfer for semantic role labeling when compared to direct model transfer and annotation projection and suggests interesting directions for further research.
