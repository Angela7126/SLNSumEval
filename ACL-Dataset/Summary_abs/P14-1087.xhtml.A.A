   We study the use of temporal information in the form of timelines to enhance multi-document summarization.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We employ a fully automated temporal processing system to generate a timeline for each input document.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We derive three features from these timelines, and show that their use in supervised summarization lead to a significant 4.1% improvement in ROUGE performance over a state-of-the-art baseline.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In addition, we propose TimeMMR , a modification to Maximal Marginal Relevance that promotes temporal diversity by way of computing time span similarity, and show its utility in summarizing certain document sets.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We also propose a filtering metric to discard noisy timelines generated by our automatic processes, to purify the timeline input for summarization.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   By selectively using timelines guided by filtering, overall summarization performance is increased by a significant 5.9%.
