   We propose a novel abstractive query-based summarization system for conversations, where queries are defined as phrases reflecting a user information needs.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We rank and extract the utterances in a conversation based on the overall content and the phrasal query information.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We cluster the selected sentences based on their lexical similarity and aggregate the sentences in each cluster by means of a word graph model.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We propose a ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed graph as a query-based abstract sentence for each cluster.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   A resulting summary consists of abstractive sentences representing the phrasal query information and the overall content of the conversation.

  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Automatic and manual evaluation results over meeting, chat and email conversations show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and previous extractive models.
