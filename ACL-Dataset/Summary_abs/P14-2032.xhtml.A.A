   There are two dominant approaches to Chinese word segmentation word-based and character-based models, each with respective strengths.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Prior work has shown that gains in segmentation performance can be achieved from combining these two types of models; however, past efforts have not provided a practical technique to allow mainstream adoption.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We propose a method that effectively combines the strength of both segmentation schemes using an efficient dual-decomposition algorithm for joint inference.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Our method is simple and easy to implement.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Experiments on SIGHAN 2003 and 2005 evaluation datasets show that our method achieves the best reported results to date on 6 out of 7 datasets.
