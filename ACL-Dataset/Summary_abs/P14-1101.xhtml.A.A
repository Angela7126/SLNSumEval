   Learning phonetic categories is one of the first steps to learning a language, yet is hard to do using only distributional phonetic information.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Semantics could potentially be useful, since words with different meanings have distinct phonetics, but it is unclear how many word meanings are known to infants learning phonetic categories.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We show that attending to a weaker source of semantics, in the form of a distribution over topics in the current context, can lead to improvements in phonetic category learning.

   In our model, an extension of a previous model of joint word-form and phonetic category inference, the probability of word-forms is topic-dependent, enabling the model to find significantly better phonetic vowel categories and word-forms than a model with no semantic knowledge.
