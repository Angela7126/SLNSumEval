   Accurate scoring of syntactic structures such as head-modifier arcs in dependency parsing typically requires rich, high-dimensional feature representations.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   A small subset of such features is often selected manually.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   This is problematic when features lack clear linguistic meaning as in embeddings or when the information is blended across features.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In this paper, we use tensors to map high-dimensional feature vectors into low dimensional representations.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We explicitly maintain the parameters as a low-rank tensor to obtain low dimensional representations of words in their syntactic roles, and to leverage modularity in the tensor for easy training with online algorithms.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Our parser consistently outperforms the Turbo and MST parsers across 14 different languages.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   We also obtain the best published UAS results on 5 languages.
