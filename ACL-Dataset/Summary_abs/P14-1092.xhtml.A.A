   We propose a robust answer reranking model for non-factoid questions that integrates lexical semantics with discourse information, driven by two representations of discourse a shallow representation centered around discourse markers, and a deep one based on Rhetorical Structure Theory.

   We evaluate the proposed model on two corpora from different genres and domains one from Yahoo.

   We experimentally demonstrate that the discourse structure of non-factoid answers provides information that is complementary to lexical semantic similarity between question and answer, improving performance up to 24% (relative) over a state-of-the-art model that exploits lexical semantic similarity alone.

   We further demonstrate excellent domain transfer of discourse information, suggesting these discourse features have general utility to non-factoid question answering.
