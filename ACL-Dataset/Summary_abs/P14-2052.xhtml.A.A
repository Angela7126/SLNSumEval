   Many methods of text summarization combining sentence selection and sentence compression have recently been proposed.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Although the dependency between words has been used in most of these methods, the dependency between sentences, i.e.,, rhetorical structures, has not been exploited in such joint methods.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We used both dependency between words and dependency between sentences by constructing a nested tree, in which nodes in the document tree representing dependency between sentences were replaced by a sentence tree representing dependency between words.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We formulated a summarization task as a combinatorial optimization problem, in which the nested tree was trimmed without losing important content in the source document.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The results from an empirical evaluation revealed that our method based on the trimming of the nested tree significantly improved the summarization of texts.
