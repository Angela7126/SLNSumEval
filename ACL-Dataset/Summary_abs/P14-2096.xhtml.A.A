   Creating cross-language article links among different online encyclopedias is now an important task in the unification of multilingual knowledge bases.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   In this paper, we propose a cross-language article linking method using a mixed-language topic model and hypernym translation features based on an SVM model to link English Wikipedia and Chinese Baidu Baike, the most widely used Wiki-like encyclopedia in China.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   To evaluate our approach, we compile a data set from the top 500 Baidu Baike articles and their corresponding English Wiki articles.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The evaluation results show that our approach achieves 80.95% in MRR and 87.46% in recall.

   Our method does not heavily depend on linguistic characteristics and can be easily extended to generate cross-language article links among different online encyclopedias in other languages.
