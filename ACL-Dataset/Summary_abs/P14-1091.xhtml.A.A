   A typical knowledge-based question answering (KB-QA) system faces two challenges one is to transform natural language questions into their meaning representations (MRs); the other is to retrieve answers from knowledge bases (KBs) using generated MRs.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Unlike previous methods which treat them in a cascaded manner, we present a translation-based approach to solve these two tasks in one unified framework.

   We translate questions to answers based on CYK parsing.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Answers as translations of the span covered by each CYK cell are obtained by a question translation method, which first generates formal triple queries as MRs for the span based on question patterns and relation expressions, and then retrieves answers from a given KB based on triple queries generated.

   A linear model is defined over derivations, and minimum error rate training is used to tune feature weights based on a set of question-answer pairs.

   Compared to a KB-QA system using a state-of-the-art semantic parser, our method achieves better results.
