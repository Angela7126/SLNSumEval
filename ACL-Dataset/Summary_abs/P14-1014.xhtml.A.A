   In this paper 1 1 This work was done while the first author was visiting SUTD we address the problem of web-domain POS tagging using a two-phase approach.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The first phase learns representations that capture regularities underlying web text.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The representation is integrated as features into a neural network that serves as a scorer for an easy-first POS tagger.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Parameters of the neural network are trained using guided learning in the second phase.

   Experiment on the SANCL 2012 shared task show that our approach achieves 93.27 % average tagging accuracy, which is the best accuracy reported so far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers.
