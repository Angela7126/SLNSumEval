   Although the distributional hypothesis has been applied successfully in many natural language processing tasks, systems using distributional information have been limited to a single domain because the distribution of a word can vary between domains as the word s predominant meaning changes.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   However, if it were possible to predict how the distribution of a word changes from one domain to another, the predictions could be used to adapt a system trained in one domain to work in another.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We propose an unsupervised method to predict the distribution of a word in one domain, given its distribution in another domain.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We evaluate our method on two tasks cross-domain part-of-speech tagging and cross-domain sentiment classification.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   In both tasks, our method significantly outperforms competitive baselines and returns results that are statistically comparable to current state-of-the-art methods, while requiring no task-specific customisations.
