   A common task in qualitative data analysis is to characterize the usage of a linguistic entity by issuing queries over syntactic relations between words.

   Previous interfaces for searching over syntactic structures require programming-style queries.

   User interface research suggests that it is easier to recognize a pattern than to compose it from scratch; therefore, interfaces for non-experts should show previews of syntactic relations.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   What these previews should look like is an open question that we explored with a 400-participant Mechanical Turk experiment.

   We found that syntactic relations are recognized with 34% higher accuracy when contextual examples are shown than a baseline of naming the relations alone.

   This suggests that user interfaces should display contextual examples of syntactic relations to help users choose between different relations.
