  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Our motivation is to better understand implicit details about the writing process and knowledge flow in collaboratively created resources.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Based on properties of the involved edit and turn, we have defined constraints for corresponding edit-turn-pairs.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We manually annotated a corpus of 636 corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Furthermore, we show how our data can be used to automatically identify corresponding edit-turn-pairs.

   With the help of supervised machine learning, we achieve an accuracy of .87 for this task.
