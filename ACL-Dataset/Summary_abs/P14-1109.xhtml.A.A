   By performing probability integral transform , our approach moves beyond the standard count-based bag-of-words models in NLP, and improves previous work on text regression by incorporating the correlation among local features in the form of semiparametric Gaussian copula.

   In experiments, we show that our model significantly outperforms strong linear and non-linear discriminative baselines on three datasets under various settings.
