   We propose a supervised method of extracting event causalities like conduct slash-and-burn agriculture exacerbate desertification from the web using semantic relation (between nouns), context, and association features.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Experiments show that our method outperforms baselines that are based on state-of-the-art methods.

   We also propose methods of generating future scenarios like conduct slash-and-burn agriculture exacerbate desertification increase Asian dust (from China) asthma gets worse.

  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Experiments show that we can generate 50,000 scenarios with 68% precision.

   We also generated a scenario deforestation continues global warming worsens sea temperatures rise vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) , which is written in no document in our input web corpus crawled in 2007.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   But the vibrio risk due to global warming was observed in Baker-Austin et al. 2013.

   Thus, we predicted the future event sequence in a sense.
