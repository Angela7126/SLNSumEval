   Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) is a framework of natural language semantics with easy-to-process structures as well as strict semantics.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   In this paper, we equip the DCS framework with logical inference, by defining abstract denotations as an abstraction of the computing process of denotations in original DCS.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   An inference engine is built to achieve inference on abstract denotations.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Furthermore, we propose a way to generate on-the-fly knowledge in logical inference, by combining our framework with the idea of tree transformation.

   Experiments on FraCaS and PASCAL RTE datasets show promising results.
