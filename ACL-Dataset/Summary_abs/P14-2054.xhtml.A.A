   We propose two polynomial time inference algorithms to compress sentences under bigram and dependency-factored objectives.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The first algorithm is exact and requires O ( n 6 ) running time.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   It extends Eisner s cubic time parsing algorithm by using virtual dependency arcs to link deleted words.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Two signatures are added to each span, indicating the number of deleted words and the rightmost kept word within the span.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The second algorithm is a fast approximation of the first one.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   It relaxes the compression ratio constraint using Lagrangian relaxation, and thereby requires O ( n 4 ) running time.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Experimental results on the popular sentence compression corpus demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.
