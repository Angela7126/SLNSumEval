   However, the historical context-based projection method dedicated to this task is relatively insensitive to the sizes of each part of the comparable corpus.

   Within this context, we have carried out a study on the influence of unbalanced specialized comparable corpora on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction through different experiments.

   Moreover, we have introduced a regression model that boosts the observations of word co-occurrences used in the context-based projection method.

   Our results show that the use of unbalanced specialized comparable corpora induces a significant gain in the quality of extracted lexicons.
