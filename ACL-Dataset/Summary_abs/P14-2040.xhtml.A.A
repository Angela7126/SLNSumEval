   This paper presents a method for detecting words related to a topic (we call them topic words) over time in the stream of documents.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Topic words are widely distributed in the stream of documents, and sometimes they frequently appear in the documents, and sometimes not.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We propose a method to reinforce topic words with low frequencies by collecting documents from the corpus, and applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation [ 4 ] to these documents.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   For the results of LDA, we identified topic words by using Moving Average Convergence Divergence.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   In order to evaluate the method, we applied the results of topic detection to extractive multi-document summarization.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   The results showed that the method was effective for sentence selection in summarization.
