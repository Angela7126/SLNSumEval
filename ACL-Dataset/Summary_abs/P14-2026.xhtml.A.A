   This paper introduces a novel pre-ordering approach based on dependency parsing for Chinese-English SMT.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We present a set of dependency-based pre-ordering rules which improved the BLEU score by 1.61 on the NIST 2006 evaluation data.

   We also investigate the accuracy of the rule set by conducting human evaluations.
