   Semantic hierarchy construction aims to build structures of concepts linked by hypernym hyponym ( is-a ) relations.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   A major challenge for this task is the automatic discovery of such relations.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   This paper proposes a novel and effective method for the construction of semantic hierarchies based on word embeddings, which can be used to measure the semantic relationship between words.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We identify whether a candidate word pair has hypernym hyponym relation by using the word-embedding-based semantic projections between words and their hypernyms.

   Our result, an F-score of 73.74%, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Moreover, combining our method with a previous manually-built hierarchy extension method can further improve F-score to 80.29%.
