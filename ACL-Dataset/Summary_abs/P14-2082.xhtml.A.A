   Today s event ordering research is heavily dependent on the annotated corpora available to it.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The corpora influence shared evaluations and drive algorithm development.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Partly due to this dependence, most research focuses on partial orderings of a document s events.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   For instance, the TempEval competitions and the TimeBank only annotate small portions of the event graph.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   They focus on the most salient events or on specific types of event pairs (e.g.,, only events in the same sentence.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Deeper temporal reasoners struggle with this sparsity because the entire temporal picture is not represented.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   This paper proposes a new annotation process with a unique mechanism to force annotators to label connected graphs.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   It generates 10 times more relations per document than the TimeBank and the corpus is larger than all current corpora.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   We hope this new annotation framework will encourage research on new models, particularly global models with deep reasoning.
