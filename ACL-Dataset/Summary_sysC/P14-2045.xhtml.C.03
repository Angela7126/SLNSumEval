<a href="#0" id="0">We found that syntactic relations are recognized with 34% higher accuracy when contextual examples are shown than a baseline of naming the relations alone.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This suggests that user interfaces should display contextual examples of syntactic relations to help users choose between different relations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our results confirm that showing examples in the form of words or phrases significantly improves the accuracy with which grammatical relationships are recognized over the standard baseline of showing the relation name with blanks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These findings suggest that a query interface in which a user enters a word of interest and the system shows candidate grammatical relations augmented with examples from the text will be more successful than the baseline of simply naming the relation and showing gaps where the participating words appear.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In each task, they were shown a list of sentences containing a particular syntactic relationship between highlighted words.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Grammatical relations are identified more accurately when shown with examples of contextualizing words or phrases than without.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The baseline presentation (Figure 4 ) named the linguistic relation and showed a blank space with a pink background for the varying word in the relationship, the focus word highlighted in yellow and underlined, and any necessary additional words necessary to convey the relationship (such as “ of ” for the prepositional relationship “ of ” , the third option.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The words presentation showed the baseline design, and in addition beneath was the word “ Examples ” followed by a list of 4 example words that could fill in the pink blank slot (Figure 4.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Participants in conditions that showed examples ( phrases and words ) were significantly more accurate at identifying the relations than participants in the baseline condition.</a>
