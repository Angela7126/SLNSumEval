<a href="#0" id="0">We study the problem of generating an English sentence given an underlying probabilistic grammar, a world and a communicative goal.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We model the generation problem as a Markov decision process with a suitably defined reward function that reflects the communicative goal.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We then use probabilistic planning to solve the MDP and generate a sentence that, with high probability, accomplishes the communicative goal.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Many such NLG-as-planning systems use a pipeline architecture, working from their communicative goal through discourse planning and sentence generation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">STRUCT takes three inputs in order to generate a single sentence.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Following prior work [ 11 ] , we consider a series of sentence generation problems which require the planner to generate a sentence like “ The Adj 1 Adj 2 … Adj k dog chased the cat ” , where the string of adjectives is a string that distinguishes one dog (whose identity is specified in the problem description) from all other entities in the world.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We first evaluate STRUCT ’ s ability to accomplish multiple communicative goals when generating a single sentence.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We now evaluate STRUCT ’ s ability to generate sentences given negated communicative goals.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">STRUCT increases in generation time both as the number of sentences increases and as the number of objects per sentences increases.</a>
