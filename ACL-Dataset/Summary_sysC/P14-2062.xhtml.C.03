<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we investigate how well lay annotators can produce POS labels for Twitter data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We also show that these annotations lead to better POS tagging models than previous models learned from crowdsourced lexica [].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We take care in evaluating our models across different data sets to avoid biasing our evaluations to particular annotations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to evaluate how much each aggregation scheme influences tagging performance of the resulting model, we train separate models on each scheme â€™ s annotations and test on the same four data sets.</a>
