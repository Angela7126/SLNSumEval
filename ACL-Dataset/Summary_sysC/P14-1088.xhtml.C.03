<a href="#0" id="0">In this work we present a chance-corrected metric based on Krippendorff ’ s Α , adapted to the structure of syntactic annotations and applicable both to phrase structure and dependency annotation without any modifications.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The only work we know of using chance-corrected metrics is \citeN Rag:Dic13, who use MASI [] to measure agreement on dependency relations and head selection in multi-headed dependency syntax, and \citeN Bha:Sha12, who compute Cohen ’ s Κ [] on dependency relations in single-headed dependency syntax.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The idea of using edit distance as the basis for an inter-annotator agreement metric has previously been explored by \citeN Fournier13.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These metrics express agreement on a nominal coding task as the ratio Κ , Π = A o - A e / 1 - A e where A o is the observed agreement and A e the expected agreement according to some model of “ random ” annotation.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Let the function LAS ⁢ ( t 1 , t 2 ) be the number of tokens with the same head and label in the two trees t 1 and t 2 , T ⁢ ( i ) the set of trees possible for an item i ∈ I , and tokens the number of tokens in the corpus.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Instead, we propose to use an agreement measure based on Krippendorff ’ s Α [] and tree edit distance.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We propose three different distance functions for the agreement computation the unmodified tree edit distance function, denoted Δ p ⁢ l ⁢ a ⁢ i ⁢ n , a second function Δ d ⁢ i ⁢ f ⁢ f ⁢ ( x , y ) = TED ⁢ ( x , y ) - abs ⁢ x.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For example the only difference between the two leftmost trees in Figure 2 is a modifier, but Δ p ⁢ l ⁢ a ⁢ i ⁢ n gives them distance 4 and Δ d ⁢ i ⁢ f ⁢ f 0.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the previous section, we proposed three different agreement metrics Α p ⁢ l ⁢ a ⁢ i ⁢ n , Α d ⁢ i ⁢ f ⁢ f and Α n ⁢ o ⁢ r ⁢ m , each involving different trade-offs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Therefore we will also evaluate our metrics on real-world inter-annotator agreement data sets.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let LAS ⁢ ( t 1 , t 2 ) be the fraction of tokens with identical head and label in the trees t 1 and t 2 ; the pairwise labelled accuracy LAS p ⁢ ( X ) of a set of annotations X as described in section 1.2 is.</a>
