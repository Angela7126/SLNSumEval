<a href="#1" id="1">Our proposed semiparametric copula regression model takes a different perspective.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then we describe the proposed semiparametric Gaussian copula text regression model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this work, we apply the parametric Gaussian copula to model the correlations among the text features and the label.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The algorithmic implementation of our semiparametric Gaussian copula text regression model is shown in Algorithm 3.3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the first experiment, we compare the proposed semiparametric Gaussian copula regression model to three baselines on three datasets with all features.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">On the post-2009 dataset, none of results from the linear and non-linear SVM models can match up with the linear regression model, but our proposed copula model still improves over all baselines by a large margin.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, we investigate the robustness of the proposed semiparametric Gaussian copula regression model by varying the amount of features in the covariate space.</a>
