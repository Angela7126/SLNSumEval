<a href="#0" id="0">Moving context out of the grammar and onto surface features can greatly simplify the structural component of the parser because so many deep syntactic cues have surface reflexes, our system can still parse accurately with context-free backbones as minimal as X-bar grammars.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this work, we instead try to minimize the structural complexity of the grammar by moving as much context as possible onto local surface features.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our parser uses a minimal PCFG backbone grammar to ensure a basic level of structural well-formedness, but relies mostly on features of surface spans to drive accuracy.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One advantage of a system that relies on surface features and a simple grammar is that it is portable not only across languages but also across tasks to an extent.</a>
