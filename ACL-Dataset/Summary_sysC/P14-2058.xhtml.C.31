<a href="#0" id="0">The effectiveness of the keyword method (KM) is a well-established fact [] found that using KM to teach French made learning easier and faster than conventional methods compared the effectiveness of three learning methods including the semantic mapping, rote memorization (i.e.,, memorization by pure repetition, with no mnemonic aid) and keyword on beginner learners of a second language.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Their results show that using KM leads to better learning of second language vocabulary for beginners.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Similar results have been reported by and.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Besides all the experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of KM, it is worthwhile to mention about the computational efforts to automate the mechanism.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In [] we proposed an automatic vocabulary teaching system which combines NLP and IR techniques to automatically generate memory tips for vocabulary acquisition.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The system exploits orthographic and phonetic similarity metrics to find the best L2 keywords for each target L1 word.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Sentences containing the keywords and the translation of the target word are retrieved from the Web, but we did not carry out an evaluation of the quality or the coverage of the retrieved sentences.</a>
