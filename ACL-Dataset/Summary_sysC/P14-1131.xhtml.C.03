<a href="#0" id="0">We present CoSimRank , a graph-theoretic similarity measure that is efficient because it can compute a single node similarity without having to compute the similarities of the entire graph.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In Section 4 , we compare CoSimRank and SimRank.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">CoSimRank can either be interpreted as an efficient version of SimRank or as a version of Personalized PageRank for similarity measurement.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If d k , then the time complexity of CoSimRank is 𝒪⁢ ( k 2 ⁢ n.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In summary, CoSimRank and SimRank have similar space and time complexities for computing all n 2 similarities.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We propose CoSimRank as an efficient algorithm for computing the similarity of nodes in a graph.</a>
