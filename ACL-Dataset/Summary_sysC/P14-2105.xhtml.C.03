<a href="#1" id="1">2013 ) , we train two semantic similarity models one links a mention from the question to an entity in the KB and the other maps a relation pattern to a relation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The answer to the question can thus be derived by finding the relation – entity triple r ⁢ ( e 1 , e 2 ) in the KB and returning the entity not mentioned in the question.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A single-relation question is defined as a question composed of an entity mention and a binary relation description, where the answer to this question would be an entity that has the relation with the given entity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The mapping between the pattern and the relation in the KB, as well as the mapping between the mention and the entity are determined by corresponding semantic similarity models.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We train two CNN semantic models from sets of pattern – relation and mention – entity pairs, respectively.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">CNNSM p ⁢ m is the full system and consists of two semantic similarity models for pattern – relation and mention – entity.</a>
