<a href="#0" id="0">Given the data, the model must assign each vowel token to a vowel category, w i ‚Å¢ j = c.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Both the LD and the TLD models do this using intermediate lexemes, ‚Ñì , which contain vowel category assignments, v ‚Ñì‚Å¢ j = c , as well as a frame f ‚Ñì.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If a word token is assigned to a lexeme, x i = ‚Ñì , the vowels within the word are assigned to that lexeme ‚Äô s vowel categories, w i ‚Å¢ j = v ‚Ñì‚Å¢ j = c.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">4 4 The notation is overloaded w i ‚Å¢ j refers both to the vowel formants and the vowel category assignments, and x i refers to both the token identity and its assignment to a lexeme.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The word and lexeme frames must match, f i = f ‚Ñì.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Following previous models of vowel learning ( 8 ; 50 ; 26 ; 9 ) we assume that vowel tokens are drawn from a Gaussian mixture model.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model (IGMM) ( 35 ) includes a DP prior, as described above, in which the base distribution H C generates multivariate Gaussians drawn from a Normal Inverse-Wishart prior.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The above model generates a category assignment c i ‚Å¢ j for each vowel token w i ‚Å¢ j.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">This is the baseline IGMM model, which clusters vowel tokens using bottom-up distributional information only; the LD model adds top-down information by assigning categories in the lexicon, rather than on the token level.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the LD model, vowel phones appear within words drawn from the lexicon.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Each such lexeme is represented as a frame plus a list of vowel categories ùíó‚Ñì.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Lexeme assignments for each token are drawn from a DP with a lexicon-generating base distribution H L.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The category for each vowel token in the word is determined by the lexeme; the formant values are drawn from the corresponding Gaussian as in the IGMM.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Z h ‚Å¢ i.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">X h ‚Å¢ i.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">F h ‚Å¢ i.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">W h ‚Å¢ i ‚Å¢ j.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">Each vowel in the lexicon must be assigned to a category in the IGMM.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">The posterior probability of a category assignment is composed of the DP prior over categories and the likelihood of the observed vowels belonging to that category.</a>
