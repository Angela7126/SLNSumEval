<a href="#0" id="0">This is achieved by means of a simple neural network trained to project image-extracted feature vectors to text-based vectors through a hidden layer that can be interpreted as a cross-modal semantic space.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first test the effectiveness of our cross-modal semantic space on the so-called zero-shot learning task [ 40 ] , which has recently been explored in the machine learning community [ 18 , 49 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The fast mapping setting can be seen as a special case of the zero-shot task.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Whereas for the latter our system assumes that all concepts have rich linguistic representations (i.e.,, representations estimated from a large corpus), in the case of the former, new concepts are assumed to be encounted in a limited linguistic context and therefore lacking rich linguistic representations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is operationalized by constructing the text-based vector for these concepts from a context of just a few occurrences.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For ESP, given the size and amount of noise in this dataset, we build vectors for visual concepts , by normalizing and summing the BoVW vectors of all the images that have the relevant concept as a tag.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that relevant literature [ 41 ] has emphasized the importance of learners self-generating multiple views when faced with new objects.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, our multiple-image assumption should not be considered as problematic in the current setup.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The analysis demonstrates that, although prior knowledge about categories was not explicitly used to train the network, the latter induced an organization of concepts into superordinate categories in which the hidden layer acts as a cross-modal concept categorization/organization system.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">When the induced projection function maps an object onto the linguistic space, the derived text vector will inherit a mixture of textual features from the concepts that activated the same hidden unit as the object.</a>
