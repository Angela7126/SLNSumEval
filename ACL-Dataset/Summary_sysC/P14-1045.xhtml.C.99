<a href="#0" id="0">Intrinsic evaluations try to measure the resource itself with respect to some human standard or judgment, for instance by comparing a distributional resource with respect to an existing synonym dictionary or similarity judgment produced by human subjects [].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">They are not suitable for the evaluation of the whole range of semantic relatedness that is exhibited by distributional similarities, which exceeds the limits of classical lexical relations, even though researchers have tried to collect equivalent resources manually, to be used as a gold standard [].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessarily standard lexical relations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is not easy to decide if the non-relevant pairs are just noise, or context-dependent associations that were not present in the actual text considered (for polysemy reasons for instance), or just low-level associations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">An important aspect is thus to guarantee that there is a correlation between the similarity score (Lin ’ s score here), and the evaluated relevance of the neighbour pairs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The filtering approach we propose seems to yield good results, by augmenting the similarity built on the whole corpus with signals from the local contexts and documents where related lexical items appear together.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We differ from all these evaluation procedures as we do not focus on an essential view of the relatedness of two lexical items, but evaluate the link in a context where the relevance of the link is in question, an “ existential ” view of semantic relatedness.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As for improving distributional thesauri, outside of numerous alternate approaches to the construction, there is a body of work focusing on improving an existing resource, for instance reweighting context features once an initial thesaurus is built [] , or post-processing the resource to filter bad neighbours or re-ranking neighbours of a given target [].</a>
