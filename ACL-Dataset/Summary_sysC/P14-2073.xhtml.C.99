<a href="#0" id="0">The results for these experiments, depicted in Figure 2 , indicate that the size of the initialization sample improves mean NMI and reduces variance, and that the variance of the particle filter itself is dominated by the variance of the initial model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We observed previously that variance in the Gibbs initialization of the model contributes significantly to variance of the overall algorithm, as measured by NMI.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">With this in mind, we consider whether we can reduce variance in the initialization by tuning the initial model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus we perform a set of experiments in which we perform Gibbs initialization 20 times on the initialization set, setting the particle filter â€™ s initial model to the model out of these 20 with the highest in-sample NMI.</a>
