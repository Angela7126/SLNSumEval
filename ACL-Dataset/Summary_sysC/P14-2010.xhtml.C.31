<a href="#0" id="0">As in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator to assign class labels to a set of topics inferred on the unlabeled training documents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We use the labeled topics to find probability distribution of each training document over the class labels.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We create a set of artificial words corresponding to a class label and add (or sprinkle) them to the document.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The number of such artificial terms is proportional to the probability of generating the document by the class label.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In our text classification algorithm, we first infer a set of topics on the given unlabeled document corpus.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We then ask a human annotator to assign one or more class labels to the topics based on their most probable words.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We use these labeled topics to create a new LDA model as follows.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If the topic assigned to the word w at the position n in document d is t, then we replace it by the class label assigned to the topic t.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">If more than one class labels are assigned to the topic t, then we randomly select one of the class labels assigned to the topic t.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">If the annotator is unable to label a topic then we randomly select a class label from the set of all class labels.</a>
