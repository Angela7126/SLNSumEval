<a href="#0" id="0">We rank and extract the utterances in a conversation based on the overall content and the phrasal query information.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A resulting summary consists of abstractive sentences representing the phrasal query information and the overall content of the conversation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a by-product of our approach, we also propose an extractive summarization model based on phrasal queries to select the summary-worthy sentences in the conversation based on query terms and signature terms [ 17 ].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">2) We propose a novel ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed word graph by taking the query content, overall information content and grammaticality (i.e.,, fluency) of the sentence into consideration.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this way, the title of each summary can be counted as a phrasal query and the corresponding summary is considered as the query-based abstract of the associated chat log including only the information most relevant to the title.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This means our systems can effectively aggregate the extracted sentences and generate abstract sentences based on the query content.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The absolute improvement of 10% in precision for ROUGE-1 in our abstractive model over our extractive model (our pipeline) further confirms the effectiveness of our ranking method in generating the abstract sentences considering the query related information.</a>
