<a href="#0" id="0">We show that this method works better than using only type-based features, especially for verbs with ambiguous aspectual class.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our work differs from prior work in that we treat the problem as a three-way classification task, predicting dynamic , stative or both as the aspectual class of a verb in context.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We replicate their method using publicly available software, create a similar but larger corpus, 1 1 Direct comparison on their data is not possible; feature values for the verbs studied are available, but full texts and the English Slot Grammar parser [ 20 ] are not and show that it is indeed possible to predict the aspectual class of unseen verbs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The experiments presented in this section aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature sets described in the previous section, focusing on the challenging cases of verb types unseen in the training data and highly ambiguous verbs.</a>
