<a href="#0" id="0">We can see that the best results are obtained by the S ⁢ o ⁢ u ⁢ r ⁢ c ⁢ e p ⁢ r ⁢ e ⁢ d approach for both comparable corpora.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We can also notice that predicting the target side and both sides of the comparable corpora degrades the results.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is not surprising that predicting the target side only leads to lower results, since it is well known that a better characterization of a word to translate (given from the source side) leads to better results.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We can deduce from Table 5 that source prediction is the most appropriate configuration to improve the quality of extracted lexicons.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This configuration which simulates the use of unbalanced corpora leads us to think that using prediction with unbalanced comparable corpora should also increase the performance of the standard approach.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This assumption is evaluated in the next Subsection.</a>
