<a href="#0" id="0">The method is trained on unlabelled video data (unsupervised feature learning) and using these features, it is trained to discriminate between six sign languages (supervised learning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given that sign languages are under-resourced, unsupervised feature learning techniques are the right tools and our results indicate that this is realistic for sign language identification.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While some work exists on sign language recognition 1 1 There is a difference between sign language recognition and identification.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, to present a method to identify sign languages using features learned by unsupervised techniques [ 12 , 4 ].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given samples of sign language videos (unknown sign language with one signer per video), our system performs the following steps to learn a feature representation (note that these video samples are separate from the video samples that are later used for classifier learning or testing.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our experimental data consist of videos of 30 signers equally divided between six sign languages.</a>
