<a href="#0" id="0">In our model, an extension of a previous model of joint word-form and phonetic category inference, the probability of word-forms is topic-dependent, enabling the model to find significantly better phonetic vowel categories and word-forms than a model with no semantic knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Both the LD and TLD models are computational-level models of phonetic (specifically, vowel) categorization where phones (vowels) are presented to the model in the context of words.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given the data, the model must assign each vowel token to a vowel category, w i ‚Å¢ j = c.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Both the LD and the TLD models do this using intermediate lexemes, ‚Ñì , which contain vowel category assignments, v ‚Ñì‚Å¢ j = c , as well as a frame f ‚Ñì.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">If a word token is assigned to a lexeme, x i = ‚Ñì , the vowels within the word are assigned to that lexeme ‚Äô s vowel categories, w i ‚Å¢ j = v ‚Ñì‚Å¢ j = c.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this section we describe more formally the generative process for the LD model ( 11 ) , a joint Bayesian model over phonetic categories and a lexicon, before describing the TLD extension in the following section.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The above model generates a category assignment c i ‚Å¢ j for each vowel token w i ‚Å¢ j.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This is the baseline IGMM model, which clusters vowel tokens using bottom-up distributional information only; the LD model adds top-down information by assigning categories in the lexicon, rather than on the token level.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the LD model, vowel phones appear within words drawn from the lexicon.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Each such lexeme is represented as a frame plus a list of vowel categories ùíó‚Ñì.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We use Gibbs sampling to infer three sets of variables in the TLD model assignments to vowel categories in the lexemes, assignments of tokens to topics, and assignments of tokens to tables (from which the assignment to lexemes can be read off.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We use ùíò‚Ñì‚Å¢ j to denote the set of vowel formants at position j in words that have been assigned to lexeme ‚Ñì.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The third factor, the likelihood of the vowel formants ùíò h ‚Å¢ i in the categories given by the lexeme ùíó l , is of the same form as the likelihood of vowel categories when resampling lexeme vowel assignments.</a>
