<a href="#0" id="0">We propose leveraging the bilingual knowledge to form learning constraints that guide a supervised segmentation model toward a better solution for SMT.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Rather than playing the “ hard ” uses of the bilingual segmentation knowledge, i.e.,, directly merging “ char-to-word ” alignments to words as supervisions, this study extracts word boundary information of characters from the alignments as soft constraints to regularize a CRFs model ’ s learning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The type-level word boundary distributions, induced by the character-based alignment (VES-NO-GP), and the graph propagation (VES-GP-PL), are regarded as virtual evidences to bias CRFs model ’ s learning on the unlabeled data.</a>
