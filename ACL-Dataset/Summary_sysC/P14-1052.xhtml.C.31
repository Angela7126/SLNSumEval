<a href="#0" id="0">We study the problem of generating an English sentence given an underlying probabilistic grammar, a world and a communicative goal.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We model the generation problem as a Markov decision process with a suitably defined reward function that reflects the communicative goal.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We then use probabilistic planning to solve the MDP and generate a sentence that, with high probability, accomplishes the communicative goal.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We show empirically that our approach can generate complex sentences with a speed that generally matches or surpasses the state of the art.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Further, we show that our approach is anytime and can handle complex communicative goals, including negated goals.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Nested subclauses.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Next, we evaluate STRUCT ’ s ability to generate sentences with nested subclauses.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">An example of such a sentence is “ The dog which ate the treat chased the cat ” This is a difficult sentence to generate for several reasons.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The first, and clearest, is that there are words in the sentence which do not help to increase the score assigned to the partial sentence.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Notably, we must adjoin the word “ which ” to “ the dog ” during the portion of generation where the sentence reads “ the dog chased the cat ”.</a>
