<a href="#0" id="0">In this study we examine how the use of discourse devices to organize information in a sentence — and the mismatch in their usage across languages — influence machine translation (MT) quality.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Discourse structure has largely been considered irrelevant to MT, mostly due to the assumption that discourse analysis is needed to interpret multi-sentential text while statistical MT systems are trained to translate a single sentence in one language into a single sentence in another.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Obviously, the mismatch in implicit/explicit expression of discourse relation is related to the first problem we studied, i.e.,, if the source segment is translated into one or multiple sentences in English, since discourse relations between adjacent sentences are more often implicit (than intra-sentence ones.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For this reason we performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test for the translation quality of segments with discourse mismatch conditioned on whether the segment was 1-1 or 1-many.</a>
