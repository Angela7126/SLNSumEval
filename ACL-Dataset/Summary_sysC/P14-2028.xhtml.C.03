<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we have improved the noisy channel approach by iterative stochastic search for the best correction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To detect and correct spelling errors, the state of the art spelling correction systems use the noisy channel approach [ 6 , 8 , 1 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Iterative spelling correction with E iterations uses standard noisy-channel to correct the query q repeatedly E times.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Posterior is defined by Equation 6 for the baseline and simple iterative methods and by Equations 3 and 6 for the proposed method.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Next, three spelling correction methods were tested noisy channel, iterative correction and our method (stochastic iterative correction.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">On the ” hard ” dataset the performance of the noisy channel and the iterative methods is inferior to our proposed method, see Figure 1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Noisy channel and iterative methods ’ frontiers are considerably inferior to the proposed method on ” hard ” dataset, which means that our method works better.</a>
