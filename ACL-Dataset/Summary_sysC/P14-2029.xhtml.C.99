<a href="#0" id="0">Much of the previous research on predicting grammaticality has focused on identifying (and possibly correcting) specific types of grammatical errors that are typically made by English language learners, such as prepositions [ 19 ] , articles [ 11 ] , and collocations [ 7 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Regarding sentence-level grammaticality, there has been much work on rating the grammaticality of machine translation outputs [ 10 , 14 ] , such as the MT Quality Estimation Shared Tasks [ 2 , ยง6] , but relatively little on evaluating the grammaticality of naturally occurring text.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, the system computes the average log-probability and number of out-of-vocabulary words from a language model trained on a collection of essays written by non-native English speakers 7 7 This did not overlap with the data described in ยง 2 and was a subset of the data released by Blanchard et al.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To create further baselines for comparison, we selected the following features that represent ways one might approximate grammaticality if a comprehensive model was unavailable whether the link parser can fully parse the sentence ( complete_link ), the Gigaword language model score ( gigaword_avglogprob ), and the number of misspelled tokens ( num_misspelled.</a>
