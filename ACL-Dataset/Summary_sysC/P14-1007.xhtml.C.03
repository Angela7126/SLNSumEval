<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we revisit Shared Task 1 from the 2012 * SEM Conference: the automated analysis of negation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Example ( 1 ), where ⟨⟩ marks the cue and { } the in-scope elements, illustrates the annotations, including how negation inside a noun phrase can scope over discontinuous parts of the sentence.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, the MRS crawling operations ‘ paint ’ a subset of the MRS graph as in-scope for a given negation cue.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our MRS crawling algorithm was defined by looking at the annotated data rather than the annotation guidelines for the Shared Task [ 7 ].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For negated verbs, the guidelines state that ‘‘ If the negated verb is the main verb in the sentence, the entire sentence is in scope ’’ [ 7 , 17].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since in this case, the negation cue will not be a quantifier in the MRS, there will be no functor crawling to the verb ’ s EP.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By disallowing the addition of EPs to the scope if they share the label of the negation cue but are not one of its arguments, we block the head noun ’ s EP (and any EPs only reachable from it) in cases of relative clauses where the head verb inside the relative clause is negated.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The guidelines state that a negation cue inside of the complement of a subordinating conjunction (e.g., if ) has scope only over the subordinate clause (ibid., p.18 and p.26.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We evaluated the performance of our system using the Shared Task development and evaluation data (respectively CDD and CDE in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Of the 173 negation cue instances in CDD, Crawler by itself makes 94 scope predictions that exactly match the gold standard.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Furthermore, even a system using syntactic structure to model scope would be faced with a more complicated task than our crawling rules.</a>
