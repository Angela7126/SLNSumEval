<a href="#0" id="0">Recently, neural network models for natural language processing tasks have been increasingly focused on for their ability to alleviate the burden of manual feature engineering.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model for Chinese word segmentation called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation, MMTNN has the ability to model complicated interactions between tags and context characters.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, a new tensor factorization approach is proposed to speed up the model and avoid overfitting.</a>
