<a href="#0" id="0">We present a novel approach for automatic report generation from time-series data, in the context of student feedback generation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our proposed methodology treats content selection as a multi-label (ML) classification problem, which takes as input time-series data and outputs a set of templates, while capturing the dependencies between selected templates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that this method generates output closer to the feedback that lecturers actually generated, achieving 3.5% higher accuracy and 15% higher F-score than multiple simple classifiers that keep a history of selected templates.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, we compare a ML classifier with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach in simulation and using ratings from real student users.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that the different methods have different benefits, with ML being more accurate for predicting what was seen in the training data, whereas RL is more exploratory and slightly preferred by the students.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this work, we concentrate on content selection which is the task of choosing what to say, i.e., what information is to be included in a report [].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Content selection decisions based on trends in time-series data determine the selection of the useful and important variables, which we refer to here as factors , that should be conveyed in a summary.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The decisions of factor selection can be influenced by other factors that their values are correlated with; can be based on the appearance or absence of other factors in the summary; and can be based on the factors ’ behaviour over time.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Moreover, some factors may have to be discussed together in order to achieve some communicative goal, for instance, a teacher might want to refer to student ’ s marks as a motivation for increasing the number of hours studied.</a>
