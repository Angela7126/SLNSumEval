<a href="#0" id="0">The recently available Stanford Sentiment Treebank [] renders manually annotated, real-valued sentiment scores for all phrases in parse trees.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A typical model falling into this category is the reversing hypothesis discussed in Section 2 , where a negator simply reverses the sentiment score s ⁢ ( w → ) to be - s ⁢ ( w → ) ; i.e.,, f ⁢ ( s ⁢ ( w → ) ) = - s ⁢ ( w → ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The non-uniform distribution in Figure 1 has showed certain correlations between the sentiment values of s ⁢ ( w n , w → ) and s ⁢ ( w → ) , and such information has been leveraged in the models discussed in Section 3.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We intend to devise a model that implements Equation 4.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It bridges between the models we have discussed above that use either s ⁢ ( w → ) or r ⁢ ( w → ).</a>
