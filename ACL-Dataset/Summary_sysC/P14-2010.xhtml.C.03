<a href="#0" id="0">[] used LDA topics as features in text classification, but they use labeled documents while learning a classifier sLDA [] , DiscLDA [] and MedLDA [] are few extensions of LDA which model both class labels and words in the documents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These labeled topics are used to create a new topic model such that in the new model topics are better aligned to class labels.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator to assign class labels to a set of topics inferred on the unlabeled training documents.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We use the labeled topics to find probability distribution of each training document over the class labels.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We then infer a set of topics on the sprinkled training documents.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In sprinkling, a set of artificial words are appended to a training document which are specific to the class label of the document.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We then ask a human annotator to assign one or more class labels to the topics based on their most probable words.</a>
