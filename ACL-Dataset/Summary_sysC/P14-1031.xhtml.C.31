<a href="#0" id="0">We develop a rich set of context-aware posterior constraints for sentence-level sentiment analysis by exploiting lexical and discourse knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Specifically, we construct the lexical constraints by extracting sentiment-bearing patterns within sentences and construct the discourse-level constraints by extracting discourse relations that indicate sentiment coherence or sentiment changes both within and across sentences.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each constraint can be formulated as equality between the expectation of a constraint function value and a desired value set by prior knowledge.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The equality is not strictly enforced (due to the regularization in the PR objective 2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore all the constraints are applied as soft constraints.</a>
