<a href="#0" id="0">Consequently, we define the task of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships, with illustrating examples in Table 1 , as follows.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The input includes a Text and a Hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Two terms in the Hypothesis, predicate and argument , are marked, where a predicate-argument relationship between them is explicit in the Hypothesis syntactic structure.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Two terms in the Text, candidate-predicate and candidate-argument , aligned to the Hypothesis predicate and argument, are marked as well.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, no predicate-argument relationship between them is expressed syntactically.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This section describes a semi-automatic method for extracting candidate instances of implied predicate-argument relationship from an RTE dataset.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This extraction process directly follows our task formalization.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Given a Text Hypothesis pair, we locate a predicate-argument relationship in the Hypothesis, where both the predicate and the argument appear also in the Text, while the relationship between them is not expressed in its syntactic structure.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This process is performed automatically, based on syntactic parsing (see below.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Then, a human reader annotates each instance as “ Yes ”– meaning that the implied relationship indeed holds in the Text, or “ No ” otherwise.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">More concretely, a is often an explicit argument of another predicate p ′.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">For example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship “ derailment of train ” , which might indicate the implied relationship “ crash of train ”.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Hence p = “ crash ” , a = “ train ” and p ′ = “ derailment ”.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The Co-occurring predicate feature estimates the probability that a document would contain a as an argument of p , given that a appears elsewhere in that document as an argument of p ′ , based on explicit predicate-argument relationships in a large corpus.</a>
