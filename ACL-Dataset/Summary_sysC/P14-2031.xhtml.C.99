<a href="#0" id="0">To capture a fine-grained picture of changes to Wikipedia article pages, we rely on the notion of edits defined in our previous work [ 6 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The context of an edit is defined as one preceding and one following paragraph of the edited paragraph.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each edit-turn-pair could be labeled as “ corresponding ” , “ non-corresponding ” or “ can ’ t tell ”.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To select good turkers and to block spammers, we carried out a pilot study on a small portion of manually confirmed corresponding and non-corresponding pairs, and required turkers to pass a qualification test.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To understand the mistakes of the classifier, we manually assessed error patterns within the model of the Random Forest classifier.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Some of the false positives (i.e., non-corresponding pairs classified as corresponding) were caused by pairs where the revision (as judged by its comment or the edit context) is related to the turn text, however the specific edit in this pair is not.</a>
