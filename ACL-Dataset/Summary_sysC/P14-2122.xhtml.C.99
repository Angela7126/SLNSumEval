<a href="#0" id="0">Monolingual UWS approaches of explicitly modeling the probabilities of words through Dirichlet process (DP) models or Pitman-Yor process (PYP) models have achieved high accuracy, but their bilingual counterparts have only been carried out on small corpora such as basic travel expression corpus (BTEC) due to the computational complexity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These variables are large in number and it is not clear how to apply VB to UWS, and as far the authors aware there is no previous work related to the application of VB to monolingual UWS.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, we have not explored VB methods in this paper, but we do show that our method is superior to the existing methods.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">P ( ℱ k k ′ℱ , ℳ ) is the marginal probability of all the possible F ∈ℱ that contain ℱ k k ′ as a word, which can be calculated efficiently through dynamic programming (the process is similar to the foreward-backward algorithm in training a hidden Markov model (HMM) [].</a>
