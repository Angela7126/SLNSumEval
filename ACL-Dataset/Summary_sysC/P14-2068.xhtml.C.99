<a href="#0" id="0">This dataset was annotated by Mechanical Turk workers who gave ratings for the factuality of the scoped claims in each Twitter message.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This enables us to build a predictive model of the factuality annotations, with the goal of determining the full set of relevant factors, including the predicate, the source, the journalist, and the content of the claim itself.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While these findings must be interpreted with caution, they suggest that readers — at least, Mechanical Turk workers — use relatively little independent judgment to assess the validity of quoted text that they encounter on Twitter.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The cues that give the highest factuality coefficients are learn and admit , which are labeled as predicates of knowledge.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These cues carry a substantial amount of framing, as they purport to describe the private mental state of the source.</a>
