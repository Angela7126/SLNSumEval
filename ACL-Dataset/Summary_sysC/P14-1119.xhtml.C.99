<a href="#1" id="1">Unlike supervised keyphraseness, Wikipedia-based keyphraseness can be computed without using documents annotated with keyphrases and can work even if there is a mismatch between the training domain and the test domain.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While empirical results show that KeyCluster performs better than both TextRank and Hulth ’ s [ 20 ] supervised system, KeyCluster has a potential drawback by extracting keyphrases from each topic cluster, it essentially gives each topic equal importance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While the use of language models to identify phrases cannot be considered a major strength of this approach (because heuristics can identify phrases fairly reliably), the use of a background corpus to identify candidates that are unique to the foreground ’ s domain is a unique aspect of this approach.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To score the output of a keyphrase extraction system, the typical approach, which is also adopted by the SemEval-2010 shared task on keyphrase extraction, is (1) to create a mapping between the keyphrases in the gold standard and those in the system output using exact match , and then (2) score the output using evaluation metrics such as precision (P), recall (R), and F-score (F.</a>
