<a href="#0" id="0">The test revealed that there is a significant difference in translation quality between 1-1 and 1-many segments for Chinese but not for Arabic.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Here we study the influence of explicit discourse relations on machine translation quality and their interaction with 1-1 and 1-many segments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We compare the translation quality obtained on segments with reference translation containing no discourse connective, exactly one discourse connective and more than one discourse connective.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The ANOVA indicates that the number of connectives is not a significant factor for Arabic translation, but significantly impacts Chinese translation quality.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Here we compare the translation quality of segments which contain ambiguous discourse connectives in the reference translation to those that do not.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The finding that discourse connective ambiguity is associated with change in translation quality for Chinese but not for Arabic is rather interesting.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The relation sense makes a significant difference in translation quality for Chinese but not for Arabic.</a>
