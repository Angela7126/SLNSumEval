<a href="#0" id="0">Automatically detecting verbal irony (roughly, sarcasm) is a challenging task because ironists say something other than – and often opposite to – what they actually mean.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Discerning ironic intent exclusively from the words and syntax comprising texts (e.g.,, tweets, forum posts) is therefore not always possible additional contextual information about the speaker and/or the topic at hand is often necessary.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We introduce a new corpus that provides empirical evidence for this claim.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We show that annotators frequently require context to make judgements concerning ironic intent, and that machine learning approaches tend to misclassify those same comments for which annotators required additional context.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We show that the misclassifications (with respect to whether comments contain irony or not) made by a standard text classification model significantly correlate with those comments for which human annotators requested additional context.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This provides evidence that bag-of-words approaches are insufficient for the general task of irony detection more context is necessary.</a>
