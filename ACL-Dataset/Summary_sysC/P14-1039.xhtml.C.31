<a href="#0" id="0">We investigate whether parsers can be used for self-monitoring in surface realization in order to avoid egregious errors involving “ vicious ” ambiguities, namely those where the intended interpretation fails to be considerably more likely than alternative ones.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using parse accuracy in a simple reranking strategy for self-monitoring, we find that with a state-of-the-art averaged perceptron realization ranking model, BLEU scores cannot be improved with any of the well-known Treebank parsers we tested, since these parsers too often make errors that human readers would be unlikely to make.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, by using an SVM ranker to combine the realizer ’ s model score together with features from multiple parsers, including ones designed to make the ranker more robust to parsing mistakes, we show that significant increases in BLEU scores can be achieved.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, via a targeted manual analysis, we demonstrate that the SVM reranker frequently manages to avoid vicious ambiguities, while its ranking errors tend to affect fluency much more often than adequacy.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our simple reranking strategy for self-monitoring is to rerank the realizer ’ s n -best list by parse accuracy, preserving the original order in case of ties.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this way, if there is a realization in the n -best list that can be parsed more accurately than the top-ranked realization — even if the intended interpretation cannot be recovered with 100% accuracy — it will become the preferred output of the combined realization-with-self-monitoring system.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">With this simple reranking strategy and each of three different Treebank parsers, we find that it is possible to improve BLEU scores on Penn Treebank development data with White Rajkumar ’ s [ 28 , 36 ] baseline generative model, but not with their averaged perceptron model.</a>
