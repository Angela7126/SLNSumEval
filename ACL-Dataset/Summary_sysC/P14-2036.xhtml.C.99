<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we propose a novel model for enriching the content of microblogs by exploiting external knowledge, thus improving the data sparseness problem in short text classification.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We assume that microblogs share the same topics with external knowledge.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We first build an optimization model to infer the topics of microblogs by employing the topic-word distribution of the external knowledge.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Then the content of microblogs is further enriched by relevant words from external knowledge.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Compared with our method, the topic model based methods mentioned above remain in finding latent space representation of short text and ignore that relevant words from external knowledge are informative as well.</a>
