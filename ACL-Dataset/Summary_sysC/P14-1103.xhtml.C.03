<a href="#1" id="1">We test the model by learning the markedness constraints driving Wolof vowel harmony [].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The model must learn the markedness constraints * \textipa I and Harmony , as well as the weights for all four constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In paradigms where each markedness constraint distinguishes candidates, the learned constraints match the standard constraints.</a>
