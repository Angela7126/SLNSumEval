<a href="#0" id="0">We quantify the lexical subjectivity of adjectives using a corpus-based method, and show for the first time that it correlates with noun concreteness in large corpora.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we show how concreteness and subjectivity can be applied together to produce performance improvements on two classification problems distinguishing literal and non-literal adjective-noun pairs [ 27 ] , and classifying the modification type exhibited by such pairs [ 5 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Further, we show for the first time that adjective subjectivity correlates with noun concreteness in large corpora.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In contrast, here we present six corpus-based features designed to quantify the lexical subjectivity of adjectives.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The features Comparability and Modifiability are identified as predictors of subjectivity by Wiebe ( 2000.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">1) Subjective / objective adjectives are more likely to modify abstract / concrete nouns respectively.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">2) Subjectivity and concreteness can predict aspects of how adjective and noun concepts combine.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their performance as predictors in a logistic regression classifying the 3,250 adjectives labelled as subjective or not in the Wilson et al.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We first tested the relationship between concreteness and subjectivity with a correlation analysis over noun concepts.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For each noun n we defined its subjectivity profile as the mean of the subjectivity vectors of its modifying adjectives.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Specifically, objective adjectives are more likely to modify concrete nouns and subjective adjectives are more likely to modify abstract nouns.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Models were trained with concreteness features ( CONC and ExpCONC ), subjectivity features ( SUBJ and SUBJpfl ) and the combination of both types ( Combined.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Notably, our combined model improves on the concreteness-only model, confirming that the interaction of concreteness and subjectivity provides additional information pertinent to meaning composition.</a>
