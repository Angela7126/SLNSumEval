<a href="#0" id="0">The basic idea is to represent both queries and documents as “ bags of concepts ” , where the concepts are identified based on the information from the knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This method has been shown to be more effective than traditional term-based representation in the medical record retrieval because of its ability to handle the ambiguity in the medical terminology.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, this method also suffers the limitation that its effectiveness depends on the accuracy of the concept mapping results.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Existing studies computed the relevance scores at either visit-level, where all the medical records of a visit are merged into a visit document [ 5 , 15 ] , or record-level, where we can first compute the relevance score of individual records and then aggregate their scores as the relevance score of a visit [ 15 , 30 , 12 ].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we focus on the visit-level relevance because of its simplicity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In particular, given a patient ’ s visit, all the medical records generated from this visit are merged as a document.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The multiple concepts generated from the same aspect are related, which is inconsistent with the independence assumption made in the existing retrieval functions [ 18 ].</a>
