<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, to address the limitation caused by the inaccurate concept mapping results, we propose to regularize the weighting strategies in the concept-based representation methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Specifically, by applying the axiomatic approaches [ 7 ] , we analyze the retrieval functions with concept-based representation and find that they may violate some reasonable retrieval constraints.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We then propose two concept-based weighting regularization methods so that the regularized retrieval functions would satisfy the retrieval constraints and achieve better retrieval performance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Experimental results over two TREC collections show that both proposed concept-based weighting regularization methods can improve the retrieval performance, and their performance is comparable with the best systems of the TREC Medical Records tracks [ 25 , 24 ].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap could arbitrarily inflate the weights of some query aspects.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For example, as shown in Figure 1 , query aspect “ children ” is mapped to 2 concepts while “ dental caries ” is mapped to 3 concepts.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In the existing retrieval functions, term occurrences are important relevance signals.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, when converting the text to concepts representation using MetaMap, the occurrences of the concepts are determined by not only the original term occurrences, a good indicator of relevance, but also the number of mapped concepts, which is determined by MetaMap and has nothing to do with the relevance status.</a>
