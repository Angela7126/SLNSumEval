<a href="#0" id="0">We consider emotion analysis as an interesting and challenging problem domain of this study, and conduct comprehensive experiments on Twitter data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We employ Amazon â€™ s Mechanical Turk (AMT) to label the emotions of Twitter data, and apply the proposed methods to the AMT dataset with the goals of improving the annotation quality at low cost, as well as learning accurate emotion classifiers.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A large number of studies have explored noise elimination techniques [ 1 , 22 , 25 , 13 , 5 ] , which identifies and removes mislabeled examples from the dataset as a pre-processing step before building classifiers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">One widely used approach [ 1 , 22 ] is to create an ensemble classifier that combines the outputs of multiple classifiers by either majority vote or consensus, and an instance is tagged as mislabeled and removed from the training set if it is classified into a different class than its training label by the ensemble classifier.</a>
