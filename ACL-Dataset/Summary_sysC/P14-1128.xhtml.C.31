<a href="#0" id="0">This study investigates on building a better Chinese word segmentation model for statistical machine translation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">It aims at leveraging word boundary information, automatically learned by bilingual character-based alignments, to induce a preferable segmentation model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We propose dealing with the induced word boundaries as soft constraints to bias the continuous learning of a supervised CRFs model, trained by the treebank data (labeled), on the bilingual data (unlabeled.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The induced word boundary information is encoded as a graph propagation constraint.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The constrained model induction is accomplished by using posterior regularization algorithm.</a>
