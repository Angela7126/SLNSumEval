<a href="#0" id="0">The authors mainly report the frequency patterns of certain words that they found to be candidates for change; however a detailed cause analysis as to why and how a particular word underwent a sense change has not been demonstrated.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If a word undergoes sense change, this can be detected by comparing the sense clusters obtained from two different time periods by the algorithm outlined above.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">1 ≤ k ≤ m , 1 ≤ l ≤ n denotes the fraction of words in a newer sense cluster s j ⁢ l , that were also present in an older sense cluster s i ⁢ k.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">K = m + 1 , 1 ≤ l ≤ n denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s j ⁢ l , that were not present in any of the m clusters in t ⁢ v i.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">1 ≤ k ≤ m , l = n + 1 denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s i ⁢ k , that did not show up in any of the n clusters in t ⁢ v j.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, the matrix I captures all the four possible scenarios for sense change.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Since we can not expect a perfect split, birth etc., we used certain threshold values to detect if a candidate word is undergoing sense change via one of these four cases.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In Figure 1 , as an example, we illustrate the birth of a new sense for the word ‘ compiler ’.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We sort the candidate list obtained in Stage 2 as per their occurrence in the first time period.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then, we remove the top 20 ⁢ % and the bottom 20 ⁢ % words from this list.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">An element of the table shows the number of candidate words obtained by comparing the corresponding source and target time periods.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Columns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term ‘ birth cluster ’ for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">New slang words come up every now and then, and this plays an integral part in the phenomena of sense change.</a>
