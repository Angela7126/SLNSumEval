<a href="#0" id="0">We show that annotators frequently require context to make judgements concerning ironic intent, and that machine learning approaches tend to misclassify those same comments for which annotators required additional context.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each sentence in every comment in this corpus has been labeled by three independent annotators as having been intended by the author ironically or not.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Reddit is a good corpus for the irony detection task in part because it provides a natural practical realization of the otherwise ill-defined context for comments.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">And indeed, all three annotators requested additional context for this comment.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In other words, annotators request context significantly more frequently for those comments that (are ultimately deemed to) contain an ironic sentence.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We show that the misclassifications (with respect to whether comments contain irony or not) made by a standard text classification model significantly correlate with those comments for which human annotators requested additional context.</a>
