<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we report our preliminary efforts in building an English-Turkish parallel treebank corpus for statistical machine translation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the corpus, we manually generated parallel trees for about 5,000 sentences from Penn Treebank.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">English sentences in our set have a maximum of 15 tokens, including punctuation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We constrained the translated trees to the reordering of the children and the replacement of the leaf nodes with appropriate glosses.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also report the tools that we built and used in our tree translation task.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this study, we report our preliminary efforts in constructing an English-Turkish parallel treebank corpus for statistical machine translation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our approach converts English parse trees into equivalent Turkish parse trees by applying several transformation heuristics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The main components of our strategy are (i) tree permutation, where we permute the children of a node; and (ii) leaf replacement, where we replace English word token at a leaf node.</a>
