<a href="#1" id="1">This paper addresses a typical sub-task in textual inference scenarios, of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships which are not expressed explicitly through syntactic structure.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This paper targets such types of implied relationships in textual inference scenarios.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consequently, we define the task of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships, with illustrating examples in Table 1 , as follows.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Two terms in the Hypothesis, predicate and argument , are marked, where a predicate-argument relationship between them is explicit in the Hypothesis syntactic structure.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The most notable work targeting implied predicate-argument relationships is the 2010 SemEval task of Linking Events and Their Participants in Discourse [ 15 ].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Comparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, textual inference deals with non-core arguments as well (see example 1 in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Another case is when an implied predicate-argument relationship holds even though the corresponding role is already filled by another argument, hence not an NI.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Given a Text Hypothesis pair, we locate a predicate-argument relationship in the Hypothesis, where both the predicate and the argument appear also in the Text, while the relationship between them is not expressed in its syntactic structure.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">On the contrary, our statistical features follow the intuition that explicit predicate-argument relationships in the discourse provide plausible indication that an implied relationship holds as well.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship “ derailment of train ” , which might indicate the implied relationship “ crash of train ”.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The Co-occurring predicate feature estimates the probability that a document would contain a as an argument of p , given that a appears elsewhere in that document as an argument of p ′ , based on explicit predicate-argument relationships in a large corpus.</a>
