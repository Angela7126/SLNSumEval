<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a three-step semi-supervised training approach to optimizing the parameters of R 2 NN, which includes recursive auto-encoding for unsupervised pre-training, supervised local training based on the derivation trees of forced decoding, and supervised global training using early update strategy.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, some global information , which cannot be generated by the child representations, is crucial for SMT performance, such as language model score and distortion model score.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">So as to integrate such global information, and also keep the ability to generate tree structure, we combine the recurrent neural network and the recursive neural network to be a recursive recurrent neural network (R 2 NN.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As shown in Figure 3 , based on the recursive network, we add three input vectors x [ l , m ] for child node [ l , m ] , x [ m , n ] for child node [ m , n ] , and x [ l , n ] for parent node [ l , n ].</a>
