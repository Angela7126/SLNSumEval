<a href="#0" id="0">We often want to compute the similarity of nodes in two different graphs with a known node-node correspondence; this is the scenario we are faced with in the lexicon extraction task (see Section 6.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A variant of SimRank for this task was presented by Dorow et al.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">2009.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We will now present an equivalent method for CoSimRank.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We denote the number of nodes in the two graphs U and V by.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">U and.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">V respectively.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We compute PPR vectors p ∈ℝ.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">U and q ∈ℝ.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">V for each graph.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Let S ( 0 ) ∈ℝ.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">V be the known node-node correspondences.</a>
