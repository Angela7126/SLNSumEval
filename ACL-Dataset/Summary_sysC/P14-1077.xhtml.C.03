<a href="#0" id="0">In contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation ’ s arguments, we derive two kinds of clues from an existing KB, which are further utilized to discover the disagreements among local candidate predictions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For a tuple t , we obtain its candidate relation set by combining the candidate relations of all its mentions, and represent it as R t.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For a candidate relation r ∈ R t and a tuple t , we define M t r as all t ’ s mentions whose candidate relations contain r.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Given two relations r 1 and r 2 , we query the KB for all tuples bearing the relation r 1 or r 2.</a>
