<a href="#0" id="0">While prior works addressed such relationships as an extension to semantic role labeling, our work investigates them in the context of textual inference scenarios.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, no predicate-argument relationship between them is expressed syntactically.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To address this task, we provide a large and freely available annotated dataset, and propose methods for coping with it.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While the results reported so far on that annotation task were relatively low, we suggest that the task itself may be more complicated than what is actually required in textual inference scenarios.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">On the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The Co-occurring predicate feature estimates the probability that a document would contain a as an argument of p , given that a appears elsewhere in that document as an argument of p ′ , based on explicit predicate-argument relationships in a large corpus.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Similarly, the Co-occurring argument feature captures cases where p has another explicit argument, a ′.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Since our task and dataset are novel, there is no direct baseline with which we can compare this result.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As a reference point we mention the majority class proportion, and also report a configuration in which only features adopted from prior works (G C and S F) are utilized.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This comparison shows that the contribution of our new features (3%) is meaningful, which is also statistically significant with p 0.01 using Bootstrap Resampling test [ 11 ].</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The high results show that this task is feasible, and its solutions can be adopted as a component in textual inference systems.</a>
