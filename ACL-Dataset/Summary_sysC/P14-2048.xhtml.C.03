<a href="#0" id="0">We show further that the accuracy with which a learned classifier can detect text as machine translated is strongly correlated with the translation quality of the machine translation system that generated it.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In fact, the correlation is strong enough that we propose that this accuracy measure itself can be used as a measure of MT system quality, obviating the need for a reference corpus, as for example is necessary for BLEU [].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While Arase and Zhou [] considered MT detection at sentence level, as we do in this paper, they did not study the correlation between the translation quality of the machine translated text and the ability to detect it.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The relationship between the detection results for each MT system and the BLEU score for that system, resulting in R 2 = 0.774 , is shown in Figure 2.</a>
