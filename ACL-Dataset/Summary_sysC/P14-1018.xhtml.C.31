<a href="#0" id="0">The order of the social circle – the number of neighbors per user of interest.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">N r d ⁢ e ⁢ g ⁢ ( v i ) , n = { 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 }.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To check whether our static models are cognizant of low-resource prediction settings we compare the performance of the user model from Eq.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">1 and the neighborhood model from Eq.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Following the streaming nature of social media, we see the scarce available resource as the number of requests allowed per day to the Twitter API.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Here we abstract this to a model assumption where we receive one tweet t k at a time and aim to maximize classification performance with as few tweets per user as possible.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">8 8 The separate issue is that many authors simply don ’ t tweet very often.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For instance, 85.3% of all Twitter users post less than one update per day as reported at http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Thus, their communications are scare even if we could get all of them without rate limiting from Twitter API.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">User-Neighbor Model with Dynamic Updates relies on both neighbor N r communications including friend, follower, retweet, user mention and user tweets t 1 ( v i ) , … , t k ( N r ) following the order they arrive over time Τ ; here we dynamically update the posterior probability p ( R ∣ t 1 ( v i ) , … , t k ( N r ) ).</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We first answer whether communications from user-local neighborhoods can help predict political preference for the user.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">To explore the contribution of different neighborhood types we learn static user and neighbor models on G c ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ d , G g ⁢ e ⁢ o and G Z ⁢ L ⁢ R graphs.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We also examine the ability of our static models to predict user political preferences in low-resource setting e.g.,, 5 tweets.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Figures 6 and 6 demonstrate dynamic user model prediction results averaged over users from G c ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ d and G Z ⁢ L ⁢ R graphs.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Each figure outlines changes in sequential average probability estimates p Μ ( R ∣ T ) for each individual self-authored tweet t k as defined in Eq.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">The average probability estimates p Μ ( R ∣ T ) are reported for every 5 tweets in a stream T = ( t 1 , …⁢ t k ) as ∑ P n ( R ∣ t k ) n , where n is the total number of users with the same attribute R or D.</a>
<a href="#16" id="16">We represent p Μ ( R ∣ T ) as a box and whisker plot with the median, lower and upper quantiles to show the variance; the length of whiskers indicate lower and upper extreme values.</a>
<a href="#17" id="17">The convergence rate for the average posterior probability estimates P Μ ( R.</a>
<a href="#18" id="18">T ) depending on the number of tweets is similar to the user model results presented in Figure 6.</a>
<a href="#19" id="19">However, for G g ⁢ e ⁢ o the variance for P Μ ( R.</a>
<a href="#20" id="20">T ) is higher for Democratic users; for G Z ⁢ L ⁢ R P Μ ( R.</a>
