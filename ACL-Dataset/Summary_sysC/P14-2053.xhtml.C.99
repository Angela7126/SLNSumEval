<a href="#1" id="1">Additionally, patterns indicate the semantic arguments that provide the answer to the question, required fields, and filter condition fields.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As these patterns are matched, they will be rejected as candidates for generation for a particular sentence if the required arguments are absent or if filter conditions are present.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The patterns are designed to match only the arguments used as part of the question or the answer, in order to prevent over generation of questions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The system inserted the correct forms of release and do , and ignored the phrase As this occurs since it is not part of the semantic argument.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This task utilized a file (Biology the body) with 56 source sentences from which our system generated 102 questions.</a>
