<a href="#0" id="0">Given this sparsity, we i) leverage content from the local neighborhood of a user; (ii) evaluate batch models as a function of size and the amount of messages in various types of neighborhoods; and (iii) estimate the amount of time and tweets required for a dynamic model to predict user preferences.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When updating models over time based on Twitter, we find that political preference can be often be predicted using roughly 100 tweets, depending on the context of user selection, where this could mean hours, or weeks, based on the author ’ s tweeting frequency.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Resources like Twitter 1 1 http://www.demographicspro.com/ or Facebook 2 2 http://www.wolframalpha.com/facebook/ become extremely valuable for studying the underlying properties of such informal communications because of its volume, dynamic nature, and diverse population [ 18 , 33 ].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The existing batch models for predicting latent user attributes rely on thousands of tweets per author [ 31 , 7 , 27 , 5 , 42 , 21 ].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, most Twitter users are less prolific than those examined in these works, and thus do not produce the thousands of tweets required to obtain their levels of accuracy e.g.,, the median number of tweets produced by a random Twitter user per day is 10.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Sharing restrictions and rate limits on Twitter data collection only allowed us to recreate a semblance of ZLR data 6 6 This inability to perfectly replicate prior work based on Twitter is a recognized problem throughout the community of computational social science, arising from the data policies of Twitter itself, it is not specific to this work – 193 Democratic and 178 Republican users with 1K tweets per user, and 20 neighbors of four types including follower, friends, user mention and retweet with 200 tweets per neighbor for each user of interest.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Baseline User Model As input we are given a set of vertices representing users of interest v i ∈ V along with feature vectors f →⁢ ( v i ) derived from content authored by the user of interest.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The model makes predictions of a latent user attribute e.g.,, Republican under a model assumption of sequentially arriving, independent and identically distributed observations T = ( t 1 , … , t k ) 9 9 Given the dynamic character of online discourse it will clearly be of interest in the future to consider models that go beyond the iid assumption.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Finally, similarly to the results for the user model given in Figure 3 , increasing the number of tweets per neighbor from 5 to 200 leads to a significant gain in performance for all neighborhood types.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">T ) depending on the number of tweets is similar to the user model results presented in Figure 6.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Figures 7 c and 7 d show the amount of time required for a joint user-neighbor model to infer political preferences estimated for users in G c ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ d and G Z ⁢ L ⁢ R.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">T ) convergence in terms of the number of tweets and, especially, in the amount of time needed for user and user-neighbor models further confirms that neighborhood content is useful for political preference prediction.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">[ 7 ] rely on identifying strong partisan clusters of Democratic and Republican users in a Twitter network based on retweet and user mention degree of connectivity, and then combine this clustering information with the follower and friend neighborhood size features.</a>
