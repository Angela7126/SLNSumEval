<a href="#0" id="0">In order to address the problems described above, we explore a technique based on a sliding alignment window, shown in Algorithm 3.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We start with alignment with a fixed chunk size.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">After aligning the first chunk, we use the information derived from the alignment to determine where the next chunk should begin within each transcription.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We use a single point in the aligned output as the starting point for the next chunk, and determine the corresponding starting position within each original transcription.</a>
