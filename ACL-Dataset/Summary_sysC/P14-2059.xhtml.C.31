<a href="#0" id="0">Wouldn ’ t it be helpful if your text editor automatically suggested papers that are relevant to your research.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Wouldn ’ t it be even better if those suggestions were contextually relevant.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper we name a system that would accomplish this a context-based citation recommendation ( cbcr ) system.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We specifically present Citation Resolution, a method for the evaluation of cbcr systems which exclusively uses readily-available scientific articles.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Exploiting the human judgements that are already implicit in available resources, we avoid purpose-specific annotation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We apply this evaluation to three sets of methods for representing a document, based on a) the contents of the document, b) the surrounding contexts of citations to the document found in other documents, and c) a mixture of the two.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This captures a very strong relevance judgement about the relation between a particular citation context in the document and a particular cited reference document.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This task differs somewhat from standard Information Retrieval, in that we are not trying to retrieve a document from a larger collection outside the source document, but trying to resolve the correct reference for a given citation context from an existing list of documents, that is, from the bibliography that has been manually curated by the authors.</a>
