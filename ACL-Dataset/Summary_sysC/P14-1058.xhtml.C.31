<a href="#1" id="1">At test time, for each word w that appears in a target domain test sentence, we measure the similarity, sim ⁢ ( \mat ⁢ M ⁢ u → \cS ( i ) , w → \cT ) , and select the most similar r words u ( i ) in the source domain labeled sentences as the distributional features for w , with their values set to sim ⁢ ( \mat ⁢ M ⁢ u → \cS ( i ) , w → \cT.</a>
