<a href="#0" id="0">Task 1 at the First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics ( * SEM 2012; \citeNP Mor:Bla:12) provided a fresh, principled annotation of negation and called for systems to analyze negation — detecting cues (affixes, words, or phrases that express negation), resolving their scopes (which parts of a sentence are actually negated), and identifying the negated event or property.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As with the logical-forms representations we use, the DRS logical forms do not include function words as predicates in the semantics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From these underspecified representations of possible scopal configurations, a scope resolution component can spell out the full range of fully-connected logical forms [ 4 ] , but it turns out that such enumeration is not relevant here the notion of scope encoded in the Shared Task annotations is not concerned with the relative scope of quantifiers and negation, such as the two possible readings of ( 3 ) represented informally below.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">5 5 In other words, a possible semantic interpretation of the (string-based) Shared Task annotation guidelines and data is in terms of a quantifier-free approach to meaning representation, or in terms of one where quantifier scope need not be made explicit (as once suggested by, among others, \citeNP Alshawi:92.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, the analysis engine does not always provide the desired analysis, largely because of idiosyncrasies of the genre (e.g., vocatives appearing mid-sentence) that are either not handled by the grammar or not well modeled in the parse selection component.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In addition, as noted above, there are a handful of negation cues we do not yet handle.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Thus, we also tested fall-back configurations which use scope predictions based on MRS in some cases, and scope predictions from the system of \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12 in others.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We reviewed the 79 negation instances where Crawler made a wrong prediction in terms of exact scope match, categorizing the source of failure into five broad error types.</a>
