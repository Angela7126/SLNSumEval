<a href="#0" id="0">Starting from very few seed words (for example, just one seed word), we can extract lexical patterns that have strong statistical association with the seed words; the extracted lexical patterns can be further used in finding more new words, and the most probable new words can be added into the seed word set for the next iteration; and the process can be run iteratively until a stop condition is met.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The algorithm works as follows starting from very few seed words (for example, a word in Table 1 ), the algorithm can find lexical patterns that have strong statistical association with the seed words in which the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is used to quantify the degree of association.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our algorithm is in spirit to double propagation [ 15 ] , however, the differences are apparent in that firstly, we use very lightweight linguistic information (except POS tags); secondly, our major contributions are to propose statistical measures to address the following key issues first, to measure the utility of lexical patterns; second, to measure the possibility of a candidate word being a new word.</a>
