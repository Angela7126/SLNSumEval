<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a novel abstractive query-based summarization system for conversations, where queries are defined as phrases reflecting a user information needs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We rank and extract the utterances in a conversation based on the overall content and the phrasal query information.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We cluster the selected sentences based on their lexical similarity and aggregate the sentences in each cluster by means of a word graph model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We propose a ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed graph as a query-based abstract sentence for each cluster.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A resulting summary consists of abstractive sentences representing the phrasal query information and the overall content of the conversation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Automatic and manual evaluation results over meeting, chat and email conversations show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and previous extractive models.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">1) To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first abstractive system that generates summaries based on usersâ phrasal queries, instead of well-formed questions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">As a by-product of our approach, we also propose an extractive summarization model based on phrasal queries to select the summary-worthy sentences in the conversation based on query terms and signature terms [ 17 ].</a>
