<a href="#0" id="0">In contrast, our Proposed method predicts the distribution of a word in the target domain, given its distribution in the source domain, thereby explicitly translating the source domain reviews to the target.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Because the dimensionality of the source and target domain feature spaces is equal to k , the complexity of the least square regression problem increases with k.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, larger k values result in overfitting to the train data and classification accuracy is reduced on the target test data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As an example of the distribution prediction method, in Table 3 we show the top 3 similar distributional features u in the books (source) domain, predicted for the electronics (target) domain word w = 𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 , by different similarity measures.</a>
