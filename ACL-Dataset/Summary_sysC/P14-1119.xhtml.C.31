<a href="#0" id="0">Wikipedia-based keyphraseness is computed as a candidate ’ s document frequency multiplied by the ratio of the number of Wikipedia articles where the candidate appears as a link to the number of articles where it appears [ 37 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Another unsupervised approach to keyphrase extraction involves grouping the candidate keyphrases in a document into topics , such that each topic is composed of all and only those candidate keyphrases that are related to that topic [ 13 , 33 , 32 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There are several motivations behind this topic-based clustering approach.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">First, a keyphrase should ideally be relevant to one or more main topic(s) discussed in a document [ 32 , 34 ].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Second, the extracted keyphrases should be comprehensive in the sense that they should cover all the main topics in a document [ 33 , 32 , 34 ].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Below we examine three representative systems that adopt this approach.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Although a few researchers have presented a sample of their systems ’ output and the corresponding gold keyphrases to show the differences between them [ 56 , 42 , 37 ] , a systematic analysis of the major types of errors made by state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction systems is missing.</a>
