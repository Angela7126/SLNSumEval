<a href="#0" id="0">These cognitive dimensions together influence how word meanings combine, and we exploit this fact to achieve performance improvements on the semantic classification of adjective-noun pairs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, recent work has highlighted the application of subjectivity analysis to lexical semantics, for instance to the tasks of disambiguating words according to their usage or sense [ 28 , 2 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we show how concreteness and subjectivity can be applied together to produce performance improvements on two classification problems distinguishing literal and non-literal adjective-noun pairs [ 27 ] , and classifying the modification type exhibited by such pairs [ 5 ].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Together with the practical applications outlined in Section 1, these facts indicate the potential value of concreteness for models aiming to replicate human performance in language processing tasks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">While automatic methods have been proposed for the quantification of lexical concreteness, they each rely on dictionaries or similar hand-coded resources [ 15 , 27 ].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">1985 ) theorizes that subjective adjectives tend to develop derived adverbial forms, whereas more objective adjectives do not.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We thus define adverbiability as the frequency of derived adverbial forms relative to the frequency of their base form, e.g.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Many adjectives also function as nouns ( sweet cake vs boiled sweet.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Unlike nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjective, and the number of adjectives in texts correlates with human judgements of their subjectivity [ 12 ].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We therefore extract the frequency with which concepts are tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the assumption that ‘ pure ’ adjectives are on average more subjective than nominal-style adjectives.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Notably, our combined model improves on the concreteness-only model, confirming that the interaction of concreteness and subjectivity provides additional information pertinent to meaning composition.</a>
