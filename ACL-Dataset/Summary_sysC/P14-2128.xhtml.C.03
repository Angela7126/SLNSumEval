<a href="#0" id="0">Modern statistical dependency parsers assign lexical heads to punctuations as well as words.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this section, we conduct a set of experiments to show the influence of punctuations on dependency parsing accuracies.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Before parsing starts and after the preprocessing step for paired punctuations, our method employs a second preprocessing step to attach non-paired punctuations to their left neighbouring words.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our first experiment is to investigate the effect of processing paired punctuations on parsing accuracy.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Results are listed in the fourth column of Table 4, which shows that parsing accuracies can be further improved by also processing non-paired punctuations.</a>
