<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we propose an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method for Chinese relation extraction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Chinese relation extraction also faces a weak performance having F-score about 66.6% in 18 subtypes [].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Propose a novel Omni-word feature for Chinese relation extraction.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Entity Type and Subtype , Head Noun , Position Feature , POS Tag and Omni-word Feature.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">On the other hand, the Omni-word feature denoting all the possible words in the relation mention may generate features as.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">On the other hand, the feature based method usually uses the combined feature to capture such structure information [].</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">To use the Omni-word feature, we segment each relation mention by two entity mentions.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In the following experiments, focusing on Chinese relation extraction, we will analyze the performance of candidate feature sets and study the influence of the constraint conditions.</a>
