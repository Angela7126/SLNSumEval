<a href="#0" id="0">The focus of this study is the design and performance analysis of a measure of the syntactic complexity of non-native English responses for use in automatic scoring systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In addition, including our proposed measure of syntactic complexity in an automatic scoring model results in a statistically significant performance gain over the state-of-the-art.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The measure of syntactic complexity of a response, c ⁢ o ⁢ s 4 , is its similarity to the highest score class.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">What is the effect of including the proposed measure of syntactic complexity in the state-of-the-art automatic scoring model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Additionally, we compare the performance of an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency that includes the measures of syntactic complexity from each of the two models being compared and analyze the gains with respect to the state-of-the-art.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency.</a>
