<a href="#0" id="0">Specifically, the joint inference framework operates on the output of a sentence level relation extractor as input, derives 5 types of constraints from an existing KB to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation ’ s arguments, and jointly resolve the disagreements among candidate predictions.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These can be considered as the latent type information of the relations ’ arguments, which is learnt from various data sources.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation ’ s arguments, we derive two kinds of clues from an existing KB, which are further utilized to discover the disagreements among local candidate predictions.</a>
