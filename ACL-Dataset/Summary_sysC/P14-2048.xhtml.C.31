<a href="#0" id="0">As can be seen in the above experiments, there is a strong correlation between the BLEU score and the MT detection accuracy of our method.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In fact, results are linearly and negatively correlated with BLEU, as can be seen both on commercial systems and our in-house SMT systems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also wish to consider the relationship between detection accuracy and a human quality estimation score.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To do this, we use the French-English data from the 8th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation - WMT13 ’ [] , containing outputs from 13 different MT systems and their human evaluations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We conduct the same classification experiment as above, with features based on function words and POS tags, and SMO-based SVM as the classifier.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We first use 3000 reference sentences from the WMT13 ’ English reference translations, against the matching 3000 output sentences from one MT system at a time, resulting in 6000 sentence instances per experiment.</a>
