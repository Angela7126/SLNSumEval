<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we estimate the correlation of human judgements with five automatic evaluation measures on two image description data sets.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The images were retrieved from Flickr, the reference descriptions were collected from Mechanical Turk, and the human judgements were collected from expert annotators as follows each image in the test data was paired with the highest scoring sentence(s) retrieved from all possible test sentences by the tri5sem model in Hodosh et al.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the Flickr8k data set, all evaluation measures can be classified as either weakly correlated or moderately correlated with human judgements and all results are significant ter is only weakly correlated with human judgements but could prove useful in comparing the types of differences between models.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An analysis of the distribution of ter scores in Figure 2 (a) shows that differences in candidate and reference length are prevalent in the image description task.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Figure 3 shows two images from the test collection of the Flickr8K data set with a low Meteor score and a maximum human judgement of semantic correctness.</a>
