<a href="#1" id="1">In the current work we propose using reservoir sampling in the rejuvenation step to reduce the storage complexity of the particle filter to O ⁢ ( 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">2009 ) , we show that rejuvenation does not benefit the particle filter ’ s performance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The particle filter studied empirically by Canini et al.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We evaluate our particle filter on three datasets studied in Canini et al.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The results for these experiments, depicted in Figure 2 , indicate that the size of the initialization sample improves mean NMI and reduces variance, and that the variance of the particle filter itself is dominated by the variance of the initial model.</a>
