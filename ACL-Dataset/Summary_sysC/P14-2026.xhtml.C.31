<a href="#0" id="0">In statistical machine translation (SMT), syntax-based pre-ordering of the source language is an effective method for dealing with language pairs where there are great differences in their respective word orders.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This paper introduces a novel pre-ordering approach based on dependency parsing for Chinese-English SMT.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We present a set of dependency-based pre-ordering rules which improved the BLEU score by 1.61 on the NIST 2006 evaluation data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We also investigate the accuracy of the rule set by conducting human evaluations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We conducted our dependency-based pre-ordering experiments on the Berkeley Parser and the Mate Parser [ 2010 ] , which were shown to be the two best parsers for Stanford typed dependencies [ 2012 ].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">First, we converted the constituent parse trees in the results of the Berkeley Parser into dependency parse trees by employing a tool in the Stanford Parser [ 2003 ].</a>
