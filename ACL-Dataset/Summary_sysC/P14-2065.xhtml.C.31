<a href="#0" id="0">Importantly, the semantics listed here is not just for the verb spray but applies to all verbs from the Spray Class whenever they appear in that syntactic frame – that is, VerbNet assumes the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Note that each task is designed to elicit judgments about entailments – things that must be true rather than are merely likely to be true.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If John greeted Bill, they might have come into contact (e.g.,, by shaking hands), but perhaps they did not.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Previous work suggests that it is the semantic entailments that matter, particularly for explaining the syntactic behavior of verbs [ 10 ].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We next investigated whether our results support the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic entailments.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Even a single verb may have different semantic entailments when placed in different syntactic frames.</a>
