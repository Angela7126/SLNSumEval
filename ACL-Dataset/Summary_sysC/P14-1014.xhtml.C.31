<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper 1 1 This work was done while the first author was visiting SUTD we address the problem of web-domain POS tagging using a two-phase approach.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The first phase learns representations that capture regularities underlying web text.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The representation is integrated as features into a neural network that serves as a scorer for an easy-first POS tagger.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Parameters of the neural network are trained using guided learning in the second phase.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Experiment on the SANCL 2012 shared task show that our approach achieves 93.27 ‚Å¢ % average tagging accuracy, which is the best accuracy reported so far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The web-feature module, shown in the lower left part of Figure 1, consists of a input layer and two hidden layers.</a>
