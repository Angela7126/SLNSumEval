<a href="#0" id="0">We show that it is possible to reliably discriminate whether a syntactic construction is meant literally or metaphorically using lexical semantic features of the words that participate in the construction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our model is constructed using English resources, and we obtain state-of-the-art performance relative to previous work in this language.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the case of SVO relations, we use software and datasets from Tsvetkov et al.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">2013.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">These datasets, denoted as an svo -baseline, consist of 98 English and 149 Russian sentences.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We train SVO metaphor detection tools on SVO relations extracted from TroFi sentences and evaluate them on the svo -baseline dataset.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also use the same thresholds for classifier posterior probabilities as Tsvetkov et al.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">2013.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Our approach is different from that of Tsvetkov et al.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">2013 ) in that it uses additional features (vector space word representations) and a different classification method (we use random forests while Tsvetkov et al.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">2013 ) use logistic regression.</a>
