<a href="#1" id="1">When translating into a segmented language, an extra step is required to desegment the output; previous studies have desegmented the 1-best output from the decoder.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we expand our translation options by desegmenting n -best lists or lattices.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our novel lattice desegmentation algorithm effectively combines both segmented and desegmented views of the target language for a large subspace of possible translation outputs, which allows for inclusion of features related to the desegmentation process, as well as an unsegmented language model (LM.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We investigate this technique in the context of English-to-Arabic and English-to-Finnish translation, showing significant improvements in translation quality over desegmentation of 1-best decoder outputs.</a>
