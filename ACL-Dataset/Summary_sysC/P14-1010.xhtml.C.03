<a href="#0" id="0">Our novel lattice desegmentation algorithm effectively combines both segmented and desegmented views of the target language for a large subspace of possible translation outputs, which allows for inclusion of features related to the desegmentation process, as well as an unsegmented language model (LM.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Work on target language morphological segmentation for SMT can be divided into three subproblems segmentation, desegmentation and integration.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">They introduce an additional desegmentation technique that augments the table-based approach with an unsegmented language model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This trivially allows for an unsegmented language model and never makes desegmentation errors.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The one-best desegmentation approach segments the target language at training time and then desegments the one-best output in post-processing.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our second baseline is 1-best Deseg , where we train on segmented target text and desegment the decoder â€™ s 1-best output.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For English-to-Arabic, 1-best desegmentation results in a 0.7 BLEU point improvement over training on unsegmented Arabic.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For English-to-Finnish, the Unsup L-match segmentation with 1-best desegmentation does not improve over the unsegmented baseline.</a>
