<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for inducing verb classes that is aware of verb polysemy.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By taking this step-wise approach, we can not only induce verb classes with frequency information from a massive amount of verb uses in a scalable manner, but also deal with verb polysemy.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Induce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering predicate-argument structures for each verb extracted from automatic parses as shown in the lower part of Figure 1 , and.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Induce verb classes by clustering the induced semantic frames across verbs as shown in the upper part of Figure 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To induce verb classes across verbs, we apply clustering to the induced verb-specific semantic frames.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We can use exactly the same clustering method as described in Section 3.2.3 by using semantic frames for multiple verbs as an input instead of initial frames for a single verb.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This is because an initial frame has the same structure as a semantic frame, which is produced by merging initial frames.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We regard each output cluster as a verb class this time.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">To output a single class for each verb by using our proposed method, we skip the induction of verb-specific semantic frames and instead create a single frame for each verb by merging all predicate-argument structures of the verb.</a>
