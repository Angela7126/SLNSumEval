<a href="#0" id="0">This paper presents the first results on parsing the Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English (PPCMBE), a million-word historical treebank with an annotation style similar to that of the Penn Treebank (PTB.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We describe key features of the PPCMBE annotation style that differ from the PTB, and present some experiments with tree transformations to better compare the results to the PTB.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First steps in parser analysis focus on problematic structures created by the parser.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As discussed in Section 2.2.2 , noun modifiers are sisters to the noun, instead of being adjoined, as in the PTB.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In sum, the parser results show that the PPCMBE can be parsed at a level approaching that of the PTB.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We are not proposing that the current version be replaced by the Reduced + NPs + VPs version, on the grounds that the latter gets the highest score.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our goal was to determine whether the parsing results fell in the same general range as for the PTB by roughly compensating for the difference in annotation style.</a>
