<a href="#0" id="0">Concretely, we assume that concepts, denoted for convenience by word labels, are represented in linguistic terms by vectors in a text-based distributional semantic space (see Section 4.3.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Objects corresponding to concepts are represented in visual terms by vectors in an image-based semantic space (Section 4.2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For a subset of concepts (e.g.,, a set of animals, a set of vehicles), we possess information related to both their linguistic and visual representations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">During training, this cross-modal vocabulary is used to induce a projection function (Section 4.4 ), which – intuitively – represents a mapping between visual and linguistic dimensions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, this function, given a visual vector, returns its corresponding linguistic representation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">At test time, the system is presented with a previously unseen object (e.g.,, wampimuk.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The process of learning to map objects to the their word label is implemented by training a projection function f proj v → w from the visual onto the linguistic semantic space.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For the learning, we use a set of N s seen concepts for which we have both image-based visual representations 𝐕 s ∈ℝ N s × d v and text-based linguistic representations 𝐖 s ∈ℝ N s × d w.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The projection function is subject to an objective that aims at minimizing some cost function between the induced text-based representations 𝐖 ^ s ∈ℝ N s × d w and the gold ones 𝐖 s.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The induced f proj v → w is then applied to the image-based representations 𝐕 u ∈ℝ N u × d v of N u unseen objects to transform them into text-based representations 𝐖 ^ u ∈ℝ N u × d w.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We implement 4 alternative learning algorithms for inducing the cross-modal projection function f proj v → w.</a>
