<a href="#1" id="1">However, there usually also exists hypernym – hyponym relations among these hypernyms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we aim to identify hypernym – hyponym relations using word embeddings, which have been shown to preserve good properties for capturing semantic relationship between words.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">That is, all word pairs ( x , y ) in the training data are first clustered into several groups, where word pairs in each group are expected to exhibit similar hypernym – hyponym relations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We obtain 15,247 word pairs of hypernym – hyponym relations (9,288 for direct relations and 5,959 for indirect relations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We extract hypernym – hyponym relations in the Baidubaike corpus, which is also used to train word embeddings (Section 4.1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We are greatly interested in the practical performance of the proposed method on the hypernym – hyponym relations outside of CilinE.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our method based on word embeddings can discover more hypernym – hyponym relations than the previous methods can.</a>
