<a href="#0" id="0">Words undergo various changes when entering new languages.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Based on the assumption that these linguistic changes follow certain rules, we propose a method for automatically detecting pairs of cognates employing an orthographic alignment method which proved relevant for sequence alignment in computational biology.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms in order to infer rules for linguistic changes undergone by words when entering new languages and to discriminate between cognates and non-cognates.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a list of known cognates, our approach does not require any other linguistic information.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, it can be customized to integrate historical information regarding language evolution.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this paper, we propose a method for automatically determining pairs of cognates across languages.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The proposed method requires a list of known cognates and, for languages for which additional linguistic information is available, it can be customized to integrate historical information regarding the evolution of the language.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The rest of the paper is organized as follows in Section 2 we present and analyze alternative methods and related work in this area.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In Section 3 we introduce our approach for detection of cognates using orthographic alignment.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In Section 4 we describe the experiments we conduct and we report and analyze the results, together with a comparison with previous methods.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Finally, in Section 5 we draw the conclusions of our study and describe our plans for extending the method.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Words undergo various changes when entering new languages.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We assume that rules for adapting foreign words to the orthographic system of the target languages might not have been very well defined in their period of early development, but they may have since become complex and probably language-specific.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Detecting pairs of cognates based on etymology is useful and reliable, but, for resource-poor languages, methods which require less linguistic knowledge might be necessary.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">According to Gusfield ( 1997 ) , an edit transcript (representing the conversion of one string to another) and an alignment are mathematically equivalent ways of describing relationships between strings.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Therefore, because the edit distance was widely used in this research area and produced good results, we are encouraged to employ orthographic alignment for identifying pairs of cognates, not only to compute similarity scores, as was previously done, but to use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms.</a>
