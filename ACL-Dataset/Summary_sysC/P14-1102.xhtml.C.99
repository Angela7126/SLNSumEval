<a href="#0" id="0">Analyses of filler-gap dependencies usually involve complex syntactic rules or heuristics; however recent results suggest that filler-gap comprehension begins earlier than seemingly simpler constructions such as ditransitives or passives.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, this work models filler-gap acquisition as a byproduct of learning word orderings (e.g., SVO vs OSV), which must be done at a very young age anyway in order to extract meaning from language.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Specifically, this model, trained on part-of-speech tags, represents the preferred locations of semantic roles relative to a verb as Gaussian mixtures over real numbers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This approach learns role assignment in filler-gap constructions in a manner consistent with current developmental findings and is extremely robust to initialization variance.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Additionally, this model is shown to be able to account for a characteristic error made by learners during this period ( A and B gorped interpreted as A gorped B.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The phenomenon of filler-gap, where the argument of a predicate appears outside its canonical position in the phrase structure (e.g., [the apple] i that the boy ate t i or [what] i did the boy eat t i ), has long been an object of study for syntacticians [] due to its apparent processing complexity.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This approach to filler-gap comprehension is supported by findings that show people do not actually link fillers to gap positions but instead link the filler to a verb with missing arguments [] Further, the model presented here is also shown to initially reflect an idiosyncratic role assignment error observed in development (e.g., A and B kradded interpreted as A kradded B ; Gertner and Fisher, 2012 ), though after training, the model is able to avoid the error.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">However, previous computational models of grammar induction [] , including infant grammar induction [] , have not addressed filler-gap comprehension.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">4 4 As one reviewer notes, and subsequent work show that filler-gap phenomena can be formally captured by mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms; these have the virtue of scaling up to adult grammar, but due to their complexity, do not seem to have been described as models of early acquisition.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The model presented here learns a single, non-recursive ordering for the semantic roles in each sentence relative to the verb since several studies have suggested that early child grammars may consist of simple linear grammars that are dictated by semantic roles [].</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To handle recursion, this work assumes that children treat the final verb in each sentence as the main verb (implicitly assuming sentence segmentation), which ideally assigns roles to each of the nouns in the sentence.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Due to the findings of , this work adopts a ‘ syntactic bootstrapping ’ theory of acquisition [] , where structural properties (e.g., number of nouns) inform the learner about semantic properties of a predicate (e.g., how many semantic roles it confers.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">Further, similar to real children (see Figure 1 ) the model presented in this paper develops beyond this error by the end of its training, 12 12 It is important to note that the unique argument constraint prevents the current model from actually getting the correct, conjoined-subject parse, but it no longer exhibits agent-first bias, an important step for acquiring passives, which occurs between 3 and 4 years [] whereas the BabySRL models still make this error after training.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The fact that intransitive sentences are more common than transitive sentences in both the Eve and Adam sections of the BabySRL corpus suggests that learners should be more likely to assign correct roles in an intransitive setting, which is not reflected in the BabySRL results.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The overall reason for the different results between the current work and BabySRL is that BabySRL relies on positional features that measure the relative position of two individual elements (e.g., where a given noun is relative to the verb.</a>
