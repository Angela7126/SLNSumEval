<a href="#0" id="0">We show that this method generates output closer to the feedback that lecturers actually generated, achieving 3.5% higher accuracy and 15% higher F-score than multiple simple classifiers that keep a history of selected templates.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Firstly, they change over time, and secondly they can be dependent on or independent of each other.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, when generating feedback, we need to take into account all variables simultaneously in order to capture potential dependencies and provide more effective and useful feedback that is relevant to the students.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, some factors may have to be discussed together in order to achieve some communicative goal, for instance, a teacher might want to refer to student â€™ s marks as a motivation for increasing the number of hours studied.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We frame content selection as a simple classification task given a set of time-series data, decide for each template whether it should be included in a summary or not.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Collective content selection [] is similar to our proposed method in that it is a classification task that predicts the templates from the same instance simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The difference between the two methods lies in that the collective content selection requires the consideration of an individual preference score (which is defined as the preference of the entity to be selected or omitted, and it is based on the values of entity attributes and is computed using a boosting algorithm) and the identification of links between the entities with similar labels.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, our domain for feedback generation is motivated by previous studies [] who show that text summaries are more effective in decision making than graphs therefore it is advantageous to provide a summary over showing users the raw data graphically.</a>
