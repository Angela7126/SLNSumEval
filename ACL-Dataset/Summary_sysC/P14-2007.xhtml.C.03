<a href="#0" id="0">Our proposed metric is called Sentiment Annotation Complexity (SAC.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">With regard to this, we introduce a metric called sentiment annotation complexity (SAC.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To the best of our knowledge, there is no general approach to “ measure ” how complex a piece of text is, in terms of sentiment annotation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The complexity in sentiment annotation stems from an interplay of the two and we expect SAC to capture the combined complexity of both the sub-processes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, we describe how complexity may be introduced in sentiment annotation in different classical layers of NLP.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The simplest form of sentiment annotation complexity is at the lexical level.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The next level of sentiment annotation complexity arises due to syntactic complexity.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">This indicates that although IAA is easy to compute, it does not determine sentiment annotation complexity of text in itself.</a>
