<a href="#0" id="0">We describe key features of the PPCMBE annotation style that differ from the PTB, and present some experiments with tree transformations to better compare the results to the PTB.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Some first steps at analysis of the parsing results indicate aspects of the annotation style that are difficult for the parser, and also show that the parser is creating structures that are not present in the training material.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The PPCMBE uses a part-of-speech (POS) tag set containing 248 POS tags, in contrast to the 45 tags used by the PTB.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We call the version of the corpus with the reduced tag set the “ Reduced ” version.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">They are added only to roughly compensate for the difference in annotation styles between the PPCMBE and the PTB.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Consider first the results for the Dev section with the parser using the gold tags.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In general, the PPCMBE is affected by the lack of gold tags more than the PTB.</a>
