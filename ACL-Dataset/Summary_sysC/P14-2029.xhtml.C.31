<a href="#1" id="1">There is an extra category ( “ Other ” ) for sentences that do not fit this criterion.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">It has no grammatical errors, but may contain very minor typographical and/or collocation errors, as in Example ( 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We also trained and evaluated on binarized versions of the ordinal GUG labels a sentence was labeled 1 if the average judgment was at least 3.5 (i.e.,, would round to 4), and 0 otherwise.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Evaluating on a binary scale allows us to measure how well the system distinguishes grammatical sentences from ungrammatical ones.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">For some applications, this two-way distinction may be more relevant than the more fine-grained 1 – 4 scale.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To train our system on binarized data, we replaced the ℓ 2 -regularized linear regression model with an ℓ 2 -regularized logistic regression and used Kendall ’ s Τ rank correlation between the predicted probabilities of the positive class and the binary gold standard labels as the grid search metric (§ 3.1 ) instead of Pearson ’ s r.</a>
