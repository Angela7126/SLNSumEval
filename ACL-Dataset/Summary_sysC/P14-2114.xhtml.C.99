<a href="#0" id="0">We can treat an event as a latent variable and model the generation of an event as a joint distribution of its individual event elements.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We thus propose a Latent Event Model (LEM) which can automatically detect events from social media without the use of labeled data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It should be noted that for some events, one or more elements in their corresponding tuples might be absent as their related information is not available in tweets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As illustrated in Figure 1 , our proposed framework consists of three main steps, pre-processing, event extraction based on the LEM model and post-processing.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After the pre-processing step, non-location entities y , locations l , dates d and candidate keywords of the tweets are collected as the input to the LEM model for event extraction.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets.</a>
