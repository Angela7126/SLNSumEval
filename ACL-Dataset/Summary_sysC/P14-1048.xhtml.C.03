<a href="#1" id="1">Now we describe the local models we use to make decisions for a given pair of adjacent discourse constituents in the bottom-up tree-building.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The linear-chain CRF contains a first layer of all discourse constituents U j ’ s in the sentence on level i , and a second layer of relation nodes R j ’ s to represent the relation between a pair of discourse constituents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Like M i ⁢ n ⁢ t ⁢ r ⁢ a r ⁢ e ⁢ l , the first layer consists of adjacent discourse units, and the relation nodes on the second layer model the relation of each constituent separately.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The total time to generate sentence-level discourse trees for n sentences is Σ k = 1 n ⁢ O ⁢ ( m k 2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">By including a constant number k of discourse units in each chain, and considering a constant number l of such chains for computing each adjacent pair of discourse constituents ( k = 4 for M m ⁢ u ⁢ l ⁢ t ⁢ i s ⁢ t ⁢ r ⁢ u ⁢ c ⁢ t and k = 3 for M m ⁢ u ⁢ l ⁢ t ⁢ i r ⁢ e ⁢ l ; l = 3 ), we have an overall time complexity of O ⁢ ( n.</a>
