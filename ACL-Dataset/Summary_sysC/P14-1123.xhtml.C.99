<a href="#0" id="0">These high error rates at the recognition stage negatively affect the subsequent stages of the speech scoring system in general, and in particular, during a deep syntactic analysis, which operates on a long sequence of words as its context.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As a result, measures of grammatical complexity that are closely tied to a correct syntactic analysis are rendered unreliable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In our case, however, with only access to the overall proficiency scores, we use scores of language proficiency as those of grammatical skill.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A criterion for evaluating the performance of the scoring model is the extent to which the automatic scores of overall proficiency agree with the human scores.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As in prior studies, here too the level of agreement is evaluated by means of the weighted kappa measure as well as unrounded and rounded Pearson â€™ s correlations between machine and human scores (since the output of the regression model can either be rounded or regarded as is.</a>
