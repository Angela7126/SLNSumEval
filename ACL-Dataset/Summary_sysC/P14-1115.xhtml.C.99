<a href="#0" id="0">2) We propose a novel ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed word graph by taking the query content, overall information content and grammaticality (i.e.,, fluency) of the sentence into consideration.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We follow the same practice as [ 19 ] to build an entailment graph for all selected sentences to identify relevant sentences and eliminate the redundant (in terms of meaning) and less informative ones.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this phase, our goal is to generate understandable informative abstract sentences that capture the content of the source sentences and represents the information needs defined by queries.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The purpose of such a model is three-fold i) to cover the content of query information optimally; ii) to generate a more readable and grammatical sentence; and iii) to favor strong connections between the concepts.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, the final ranking score of path P is calculated over the normalized scores as.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Considering the fact that the abstract sentences are automatically generated and the original sentences are human-written, the grammaticality score and the percentage of fully grammatical sentences generated by our system, with higher ROUGE or quality scores in comparison with other methods, demonstrates that our system is an effective phrasal query abstraction framework for both spoken and written conversations.</a>
