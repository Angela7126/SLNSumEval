<a href="#0" id="0">In predominant sense acquisition, the task is to learn, for each target lemma, the most frequently occurring word sense in a particular domain or corpus, relative to a predefined sense inventory.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The WSI system provides us with a topic allocation per usage of a given word, from which we can derive a distribution of topics over usages and a predominant topic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to map this onto the predominant sense , we need to have some way of aligning a topic with a sense.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We design our topic – sense alignment methodology with portability in mind — it should be applicable to any sense inventory.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As such, our alignment methodology assumes only that we have access to a conventional sense gloss or definition for each sense, and does not rely on ontological/structural knowledge (e.g., the \smaller WordNet hierarchy.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We first test the proposed method over the tasks of predominant sense learning and sense distribution induction, using the \smaller WordNet -tagged dataset of , which is made up of 3 collections of documents a domain-neutral corpus ( BNC ), and two domain-specific corpora ( SPORTS and FINANCE.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For each domain, annotators were asked to sense-annotate a random selection of sentences for each of 40 target nouns, based on \smaller WordNet v1.7.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In both Twitter and ukWaC , we observed frequent occurrences of usages of our target nouns which didn ’ t map onto a pre-existing \smaller Macmillan sense.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A natural question to ask is whether our method can be used to predict word senses that are missing from our sense inventory, and identify usages associated with each such missing sense.</a>
