<a href="#1" id="1">Each basic correction proceeds as described in Section 2.1 a small number of hypotheses h 1 , … , h K is generated for the query q , hypotheses are scored, and scores are recomputed into normalized posterior probabilities (see Equation 5.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, if posterior probability of the best hypothesis was lower than threshold Α , then the original query q was used as the spell-checker output.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Posterior is defined by Equation 6 for the baseline and simple iterative methods and by Equations 3 and 6 for the proposed method.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">On the ” hard ” dataset the performance of the noisy channel and the iterative methods is inferior to our proposed method, see Figure 1.</a>
