<a href="#0" id="0">We experimentally demonstrate that the discourse structure of non-factoid answers provides information that is complementary to lexical semantic similarity between question and answer, improving performance up to 24% (relative) over a state-of-the-art model that exploits lexical semantic similarity alone.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Driven by this observation, our main hypothesis is that the discourse structure of NF answers provides complementary information to state-of-the-art QA models that measure the similarity (either lexical and/or semantic) between question and answer.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">[ 22 ] recently addressed the problem of answer sentence selection and demonstrated that LS models, including recurrent neural network language models (RNNLM), have a higher contribution to overall performance than exploiting syntactic analysis.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The ensemble model without LS (third line) has a nearly identical P@1 score as the equivalent in-domain model (line 13 in Table 1), while slightly surpassing in-domain MRR performance.</a>
