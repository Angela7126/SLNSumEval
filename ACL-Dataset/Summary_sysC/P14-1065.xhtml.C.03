<a href="#0" id="0">Rather than proposing a single new metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, and thus should be taken into account in the development of future richer evaluation metrics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use DTs generated by a publicly-available discourse parser [] ; then, we show that they can help improve a number of MT evaluation metrics at the segment- and at the system-level in the context of the WMT11 and the WMT12 metrics shared tasks [].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this work, instead of proposing a new metric, we focus on enriching current MT evaluation metrics with discourse information.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this study, we evaluate to what extent existing evaluation metrics can benefit from additional discourse information.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To do so, we contrast different MT evaluation metrics with and without discourse information.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Asiya [] is a suite for MT evaluation that provides a large set of metrics that use different levels of linguistic information.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this section, we explore how discourse information can be used to improve machine translation evaluation metrics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Below we present the evaluation results at the system- and segment-level, using our two basic metrics on discourse trees (Section 3.1 ), which are referred to as DR and DR- lex.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Group III contains other important evaluation metrics, which were not considered in the WMT12 metrics task.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The combinations with DR and DR- lex that improve over the original metrics are shown in bold , and those that degrade are in italic.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Furthermore, when combined with individual metrics in group II, DR- lex is able to improve consistently over each one of them.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We can see that the tuned combinations with DR- lex improve over most of the individual metrics in groups II and III.</a>
