<a href="#0" id="0">A major difference, however, is that instead of using hard, overlap counts between the two sets of words from the gloss and the context, this probabilistic treatment can implicitly model the distributional similarity among the elements e i and f j (and consequently between the sets 𝐞 and 𝐟 ) over a wider range of contexts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The result is a “ softer ” proxy of association than the binary view of overlaps in existing Lesk variants.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The foregoing discussion offers a second motivation for applying Bayes ’ s rule on the second expression in Equation ( 1 it is easier to estimate p ( e i f j ) than p ( f j e i ) , since the vocabulary for the lexical knowledge features ( f j ) is usually more limited than that of the contexts ( e i ) and hence estimation of the former suffices on a smaller amount of data than that of the latter.</a>
