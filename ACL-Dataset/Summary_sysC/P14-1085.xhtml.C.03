<a href="#0" id="0">Input to a hierarchical summarization system is a set of related documents D and a budget b for each summary within the hierarchy (in bytes, words, or sentences.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A hierarchical summary H of a document collection D is a set of summaries X organized into a hierarchy.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">After the sentences are clustered, we have a structure for the hierarchical summary that dictates the number of summaries and the number of sentences in each summary.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Intuitively, each cluster summary in the hierarchical summary should convey the most salient information in that cluster.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A hierarchical summary that is only salient and nonredundant may still not be suitable if the sentences within a cluster summary are disconnected or if the parent sentence for a summary does not relate to the child summary.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Thus, a hierarchical summary must also have intra-cluster coherence and parent-to-child coherence.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The parent sentence must have positive evidence of coherence with the sentences in its child summary.</a>
