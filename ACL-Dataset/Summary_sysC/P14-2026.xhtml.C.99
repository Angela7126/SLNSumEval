<a href="#0" id="0">There are two widely-used dependency systems â€“ Stanford typed dependencies and CoNLL typed dependencies.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For Chinese, there are 45 types of grammatical relations for Stanford typed dependencies [ 2009 ] and 25 for CoNLL typed dependencies.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">If the reordering produced a Chinese phrase that had a closer word order to that of the English one, this structure would be a candidate pre-ordering rule.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Conduct primary experiments which used the same training set and development set as the experiments described in Section 3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, both of them substantially decreased the total times about 60% (or 1,600,000) for pre-ordering rule applications on the training set, compared with WR07.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In our opinion, the reason for the great decrease was that the dependency parse trees were more concise than the constituent parse trees in describing sentences and they could also describe the reordering at the sentence level in a finer way.</a>
