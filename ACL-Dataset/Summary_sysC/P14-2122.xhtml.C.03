<a href="#0" id="0">This paper proposes an efficient unified PYP-based monolingual and bilingual UWS method.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, bilingual approaches that model word probabilities suffer from computational complexity.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">[] proposed a bilingual method by adding alignment into the generative model, but was only able to test it on small-scale BTEC data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This section describes our unified monolingual and bilingual UWS scheme.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Monolingual and bilingual WS can be formulated as follows, respectively.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The monolingual model â„³ is.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The bilingual model is.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We now look in more detail at the complexity of the expectation calculation in monolingual and bilingual models.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Two monolingual corpora and two bilingual corpora are used (Table 2.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">It was set to 3 for the monolingual unigram model, and 2 for the bilingual unigram model, which provided slightly higher BLEU scores on the development set than the other settings.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The proposed method with monolingual bigram model performed poorly on the Chinese monolingual segmentation task; thus, it was not tested.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The time cost of the bilingual models is about 5 times that of the monolingual model, which is consistent with the complexity analysis in Section 3.</a>
