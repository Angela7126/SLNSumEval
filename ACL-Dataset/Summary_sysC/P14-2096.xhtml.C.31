<a href="#0" id="0">Creating cross-language article links among different online encyclopedias is now an important task in the unification of multilingual knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we propose a cross-language article linking method using a mixed-language topic model and hypernym translation features based on an SVM model to link English Wikipedia and Chinese Baidu Baike, the most widely used Wiki-like encyclopedia in China.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To evaluate our approach, we compile a data set from the top 500 Baidu Baike articles and their corresponding English Wiki articles.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The evaluation results show that our approach achieves 80.95% in MRR and 87.46% in recall.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our method does not heavily depend on linguistic characteristics and can be easily extended to generate cross-language article links among different online encyclopedias in other languages.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this paper, we propose a method comprising title and hypernym translation and mixed-language topic model methods to select and link related articles between the English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike online encyclopedias.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We also compile a suitable dataset from the above two encyclopedias to evaluate the linking accuracy of our method.</a>
