<a href="#0" id="0">In case of positive feedback, the predicted translation can be treated as reference translation for a structured learning update.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Instead of and in addition to learning from human reference translations, response-based learning allows to convert multiple system translations into references.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show in an error analysis that this improvement can be attributed to using structural and lexical variants of reference translations as positive examples in response-based learning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 4 shows examples where the translation predicted by response-based learning ( Rebol ) differs from the gold standard reference translation, but yet leads to positive feedback via a parse that returns the correct answer from the database.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Lexical and structural variants of reference translations can be used to boost model parameters towards translations with positive feedback, while the same translations might be considered as negative examples in standard structured learning.</a>
