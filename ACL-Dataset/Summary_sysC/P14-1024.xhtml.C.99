<a href="#0" id="0">Lakoff and Johnson ( 1980 ) characterize metaphor as reasoning about one thing in terms of another, i.e.,, a metaphor is a type of conceptual mapping , where words or phrases are applied to objects and actions in ways that do not permit a literal interpretation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">1) we develop a new state-of-the-art English metaphor detection system that uses conceptual semantic features, such as a degree of abstractness and semantic supersenses; 2 2 https://github.com/ytsvetko/metaphor (2) we create new metaphor-annotated corpora for Russian and English; 3 3 http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/metaphor/datasets.zip (3) using a paradigm of model transfer [ 21 , 41 , 15 ] , we provide support for the hypothesis that metaphors are conceptual (rather than lexical) in nature by showing that our English-trained model can detect metaphors in Spanish, Farsi, and Russian.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Current work builds on this study, and incorporates new syntactic relations as metaphor candidates, adds several new feature sets and different, more reliable datasets for evaluating results.</a>
