<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we propose a cross-language article linking method using a mixed-language topic model and hypernym translation features based on an SVM model to link English Wikipedia and Chinese Baidu Baike, the most widely used Wiki-like encyclopedia in China.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In query translation, we translate the title of every English article into Chinese and then use these translated titles as queries to retrieve articles from the Chinese encyclopedia.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The title of each English article is translated into Chinese and represented as a vector.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For pairs that have both English and Chinese articles, the Chinese article title is regarded as the translation of the English one.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Next, we check if there is a Chinese article in Baidu Baike with exactly the same title as the one in Chinese Wikipedia.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Because of the large difference in title lengths, the value of the title similarity feature between the English article “ Nero ” and the corresponding Chinese article is low.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For example, for the English article “ Jensen Ackles ” , our approach generates a link to the Chinese article “ Jensen ” in Baidu Baike.</a>
