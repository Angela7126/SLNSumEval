<a href="#0" id="0">We go beyond traditional feature vectors by employing structural models ( STRUCT ), which encode each comment into a shallow syntactic tree.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These trees are input to tree kernel functions for generating structural features.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our structures are specifically adapted to the noisy user-generated texts and encode important aspects of the comments, e.g.,, words from the sentiment lexicons, product concepts and negation words, which specifically targets the sentiment and comment type classification tasks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Type classification.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">One of the challenging aspects of sentiment analysis of YouTube data is that the comments may express the sentiment not only towards the product shown in the video, but also the video itself, i.e.,, users may post positive comments to the video while being generally negative about the product and vice versa.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Hence, it is of crucial importance to distinguish between these two types of comments.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Additionally, many comments are irrelevant for both the product and the video ( off-topic ) or may even contain spam.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Given that the main goal of sentiment analysis is to select sentiment-bearing comments and identify their polarity, distinguishing between off-topic and spam categories is not critical.</a>
