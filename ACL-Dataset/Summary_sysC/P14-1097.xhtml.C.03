<a href="#0" id="0">Our method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Induce both semantic frames and verb classes from a massive amount of verb uses by a scalable method.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">He did not evaluate the resulting frames as verb classes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To do that, we induce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering verb uses.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, we induce verb classes by clustering these verb-specific semantic frames across verbs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Induce verb classes by clustering the induced semantic frames across verbs as shown in the upper part of Figure 1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We induce verb-specific semantic frames from verb uses based on the method of Kawahara et al.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">To induce verb classes across verbs, we apply clustering to the induced verb-specific semantic frames.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">We can use exactly the same clustering method as described in Section 3.2.3 by using semantic frames for multiple verbs as an input instead of initial frames for a single verb.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For a baseline, we use verb-specific semantic frames without clustering across verbs ( “ S-NIL ” and “ SW-NIL ” ), where these frames are considered to be verb classes but not shared across verbs.</a>
