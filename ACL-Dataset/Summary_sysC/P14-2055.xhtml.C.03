<a href="#0" id="0">We present a model based on Bayesian surprise which provides an intuitive way to identify surprising information from a summarization input with respect to a background corpus.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this work, we compare our system to topic word based ones since the latter is also a general method to find surprising new words in a set of input documents but is not a bayesian approach.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We first compute a surprise value for each word type in the summarization input.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Here we describe the input sets and background corpus used for the two summarization tasks and define the prior distribution for each.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In practice for both tasks, a new summarization input can have words unseen in the background.</a>
