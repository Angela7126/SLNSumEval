<a href="#0" id="0">The ANOVA indicates that the number of connectives is not a significant factor for Arabic translation, but significantly impacts Chinese translation quality.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A closer inspection using Wilcoxon rank sum tests reveals that the difference in translation quality is statistically significant only between the groups of segments with no connective vs those with more than one connective.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A number of discourse connectives are ambiguous with respect to the discourse relation they convey.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, while can signal either comparison or temporal relations and since can signal either contingency or temporal.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In translation this becomes a problem when the ambiguity is present in one language but not in the other.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In such cases the sense in source ought to be disambiguated before translation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Here we compare the translation quality of segments which contain ambiguous discourse connectives in the reference translation to those that do not.</a>
