<a href="#0" id="0">Two sense clusters s i ⁢ z 1 and s i ⁢ z 2 in t ⁢ v i join to make a single cluster s j ⁢ p in t ⁢ v j.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">1 ≤ k ≤ m , 1 ≤ l ≤ n denotes the fraction of words in a newer sense cluster s j ⁢ l , that were also present in an older sense cluster s i ⁢ k.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">K = m + 1 , 1 ≤ l ≤ n denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s j ⁢ l , that were not present in any of the m clusters in t ⁢ v i.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">1 ≤ k ≤ m , l = n + 1 denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s i ⁢ k , that did not show up in any of the n clusters in t ⁢ v j.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 3 shows the evaluation results for a few candidate words, flagged due to birth.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Columns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term ‘ birth cluster ’ for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For a candidate word flagged as birth, we first find out the set of all WordNet synset ids for its CW clusters in the source time period (1909-1953 in this case.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Let S i ⁢ n ⁢ i ⁢ t denote the union of these synset ids.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We then find WordNet synset id for its birth-cluster, say s n ⁢ e ⁢ w.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Then, if s n ⁢ e ⁢ w ∉ S i ⁢ n ⁢ i ⁢ t , it implies that this is a new sense that was not present in the source clusters and we call it a ‘ success ’ as per WordNet.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">For the join case, we find WordNet synset ids s 1 and s 2 for the clusters obtained in the source time period and s n ⁢ e ⁢ w for the join cluster in the target time period.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">If s 1 ≠ s 2 and s n ⁢ e ⁢ w is either s 1 or s 2 , we call it a ‘ success ’.</a>
