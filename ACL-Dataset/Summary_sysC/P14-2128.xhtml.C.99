<a href="#0" id="0">Moreover, experimental results showed that parsing accuracy of content words drops on sentences which contain higher ratios of punctuations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">One reason for this result is that projective dependency parsers satisfy the “ no crossing links ” constraint, and errors in punctuations may prevent correct word-word dependencies from being created (see section 2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can see that although all the parsers achieve above 90 ⁢ % UAS on words, the UAS on punctuations are mostly below 85 ⁢ %.</a>
