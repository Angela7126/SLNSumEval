<a href="#0" id="0">Note that the connotation inference algorithm, as given in Algorithm 3.2 , remains exactly the same for all the graphs described above.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The only difference is the set of parameters used; while G Word w/ Pred-Arg and G Word w/ Overlay contain one and two edge types, respectively and only use compatibilities ( t 1 ) and ( t 2 ) , G Word uses all four as given in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The G Word+Sense w/ SynSim graphs use an additional compatibility matrix for the synset similarity edges of type t 5 , which is the same as the one used for t 1 , i.e.,, similar synsets are likely to have the same connotation label.</a>
