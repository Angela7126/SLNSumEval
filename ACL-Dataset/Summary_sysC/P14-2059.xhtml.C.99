<a href="#0" id="0">We apply this evaluation to three sets of methods for representing a document, based on a) the contents of the document, b) the surrounding contexts of citations to the document found in other documents, and c) a mixture of the two.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If the system is able to take into account the context in which the citation occurs — for example, that papers relevant to our example above are not only about text generation systems, but specifically mention applying coherence theories — then this would be much more informative.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">So we define a context-based citation recommendation ( cbcr ) system as one that assists the author of a draft document by suggesting other documents with content that is relevant to a particular context in the draft.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the case where multiple citations share the same context, that is, they are made in direct succession (e.g., “… compared with previous approaches (Author (2005), Author and Author (2007)) ” ), the first n elements of the list of suggested documents all count as the first element.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our ultimate goal is matching claims and comparing methods, which would likely benefit from an analysis of the full contents of the document and not just previous citations of it, so in future work we also intend to use the context from the successful external results as training data for a summarisation stage.</a>
