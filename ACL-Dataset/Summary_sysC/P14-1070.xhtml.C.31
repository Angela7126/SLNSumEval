<a href="#0" id="0">The architectures we investigated vary depending on whether the MWE status of sequences of tokens is predicted via dependency parsing or via an external tool (described in section 5 ), and this dichotomy applies both to structured MWEs and flat MWEs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">More precisely, we consider the following alternative for irregular MWEs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">IRREG-BY-PARSER the MWE status, flat topology and POS are all predicted via dependency parsing, using representations for training and parsing, with all information for irregular MWEs encoded in topology and labels (as for in vain in Figure 2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Parsing i) MWE analysis with classification of MWEs into regular or irregular, (ii) merge of predicted irregular MWEs, (iii) tagging and morphological prediction, (iv) parsing.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The evaluation on “ structured representation ” can be interpreted as an evaluation of the parsing task plus the recognition of irregular MWEs only both LAS and UAS are measured independently of errors on regular MWE status (note the UAS is exactly the same than in the “ labeled ” case.</a>
