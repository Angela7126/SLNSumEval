<a href="#1" id="1">Compared to the previous work, ( i )  we use a different discourse representation (RST), ( ii )  we compare discourse parses using all-subtree kernels [] , ( iii )  we evaluate on much larger datasets, for several language pairs and for multiple metrics, and ( iv )  we do demonstrate better correlation with human judgments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The organizers relied on a random selection of systems, and a large number of comparisons between pairs of them, to make comparisons across systems feasible [].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As a result, for each source sentence, only relative rankings were available.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As in the WMT12 experimental setup, we use these rankings to calculate correlation with human judgments at the sentence-level, i.e., Kendall ’ s Tau; see [] for details.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, over all metrics and all language pairs, DR- lex is able to obtain an average improvement in correlation of +.035, which is remarkably higher than that of DR.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus, we can conclude that at the system-level, adding discourse information to a metric, even using the simplest of the combination schemes, is a good idea for most of the metrics, and can help to significantly improve the correlation with human judgments.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Conversely, ties and incomplete discourse analysis were not a problem at the system-level, where evidence from all 3,003 test sentences is aggregated, and allows to rank systems more precisely.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Due to the low score of DR as an individual metric, it fails to yield improvements when uniformly combined with other metrics.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">This is remarkable given that DR has a strong negative Tau as an individual metric at the sentence-level.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">This suggests that both DR and DR- lex contain information that is complementary to that of the individual metrics that we experimented with.</a>
