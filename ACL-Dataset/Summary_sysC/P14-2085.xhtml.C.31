<a href="#0" id="0">This paper describes a new approach to predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context, i.e.,, whether a verb is used in a stative or dynamic sense.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We identify two challenging cases of this problem when the verb is unseen in training data, and when the verb is ambiguous for aspectual class.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A semi-supervised approach using linguistically-motivated features and a novel set of distributional features based on representative verb types allows us to predict classes accurately, even for unseen verbs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Many frequent verbs can be either stative or dynamic in different contexts, which has not been modeled by previous work; we use contextual features to resolve this ambiguity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In addition, we introduce two new datasets of clauses marked for aspectual class.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In contrast to Siegel and McKeown ( 2000 ) , we do not conduct the task of predicting aspectual class solely at the type level, as such an approach ignores the minority class of ambiguous verbs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Instead we predict the aspectual class of verbs in the context of their arguments and modifiers.</a>
