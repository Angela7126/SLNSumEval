<a href="#0" id="0">Even with simple probability estimates such as maximum likelihood, the model gains significant improvement over the Lesk algorithm on word sense disambiguation tasks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To address this limitation, a Naive Bayes model (NBM) is proposed in this study as a novel, probabilistic treatment of overlap in gloss-based WSD.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, we opt for the “ simplified Lesk ” () , where inventory senses are assessed by gloss-context overlap rather than gloss-gloss overlap.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Among Lesk variants, extended the gloss of both inventory senses and the context words to include words in their related synsets in WordNet.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">An extension by differentiated context word senses and extended shorter glosses with related glosses in WordNet measured overlap by concept similarity () between each inventory sense and the context words.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Model performance is evaluated in terms of WSD accuracy using Equation ( 2 ) as the scoring function.</a>
