<a href="#0" id="0">2) We propose a robust method to transform single-relation questions into formal triple queries as their MRs, which trades off between transformation accuracy and recall using question patterns and relation expressions respectively.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Formally, given a knowledge base 𝒦⁢ℬ and an NL question 𝒬 , our KB-QA method generates a set of formal triples-answer pairs { ⟨𝒟 , 𝒜⟩ } as derivations, which are scored and ranked by the distribution P ( ⟨𝒟 , 𝒜⟩𝒦ℬ , 𝒬 ) defined as follows.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">1) Question answering and semantic parsing are performed in an joint way under a unified framework; (2) A robust method is proposed to map NL questions to their formal triple queries, which trades off the mapping quality by using question patterns and relation expressions in a cascaded way; and (3) We use domain independent feature set which allowing us to use a relatively small number of question-answer pairs to tune model parameters.</a>
