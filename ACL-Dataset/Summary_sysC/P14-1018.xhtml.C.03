<a href="#0" id="0">Each vertex is attributed with a feature vector f →⁢ ( v i ) which encodes communications e.g.,, tweets available for a given user.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Notably, users from different social circles can be shared across the users of the same or different classes e.g.,, a user v j can be in both follower circle v j ∈ N f ⁢ ( v i ) , v i ∈ D and retweet circle v j ∈ N w ⁢ ( v k ) , v k ∈ R.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This dataset consists of 200 Republican and 200 Democratic users associated with 925 tweets on average per user.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The model dynamically updates posterior probability estimates p ( a ( v i ) = R t k ) for a given user v i as an additional evidence t k is acquired, as defined in a general form below for any latent attribute a ⁢ ( v i ) ∈ A given the tweets T of user v i.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To explore the contribution of different neighborhood types we learn static user and neighbor models on G c ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ d , G g ⁢ e ⁢ o and G Z ⁢ L ⁢ R graphs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For that purpose, we take a random partition containing 100 users of G c ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ d graph and perform four independent classification experiments – two runs using 5 and two runs using 100 tweets per user.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, similarly to the results for the user model given in Figure 3 , increasing the number of tweets per neighbor from 5 to 200 leads to a significant gain in performance for all neighborhood types.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Figures 6 and 6 demonstrate dynamic user model prediction results averaged over users from G c ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ d and G Z ⁢ L ⁢ R graphs.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The average probability estimates p Μ ( R ∣ T ) are reported for every 5 tweets in a stream T = ( t 1 , …⁢ t k ) as ∑ P n ( R ∣ t k ) n , where n is the total number of users with the same attribute R or D.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Figure 7 a and 7 b illustrate the amount of time required for the user model to infer political preferences estimated for 1,031 users in G c ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ d and 371 users in G Z ⁢ L ⁢ R.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We estimate dynamic posterior updates from a joint stream of user and neighbor communications in G g ⁢ e ⁢ o , G c ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ d and G Z ⁢ L ⁢ R graphs.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Then instead of waiting for the next user tweet we rely on any neighbor tweets that appear until the user produces the next tweet t 1 ⁢ ( v i.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">T ) depending on the number of tweets is similar to the user model results presented in Figure 6.</a>
