<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a method of summarizing a single document that utilizes dependency between sentences obtained from rhetorical structures and dependency between words obtained from a dependency parser.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have explained our method with an example in Figure 1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">First, we represent a document as a nested tree , which is composed of two types of tree structures a document tree and a sentence tree.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The document tree is a tree that has sentences as nodes and head modifier relationships between sentences obtained by RST as edges.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The sentence tree is a tree that has words as nodes and head modifier relationships between words obtained by the dependency parser as edges.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We can build the nested tree by regarding each node of the document tree as a sentence tree.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, we formulate the problem of single document summarization as that of combinatorial optimization, which is based on the trimming of the nested tree.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Our method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Extracting a subtree from the dependency tree of words is one approach to sentence compression [ 21 , 19 , 17 , 10 ].</a>
