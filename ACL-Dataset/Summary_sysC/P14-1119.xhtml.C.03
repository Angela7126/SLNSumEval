<a href="#0" id="0">An observation commonly exploited in keyphrase extraction from scientific articles and news articles is that keyphrases typically appear not only at the beginning [ 56 ] but also at the end [ 37 ] of a document.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Another observation commonly exploited in keyphrase extraction from scientific articles and news articles is that the keyphrases in a document are typically related to each other [ 51 , 38 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The goal is to train a classifier on documents annotated with keyphrases to determine whether a candidate phrase is a keyphrase.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Each node of the graph corresponds to a candidate keyphrase from the document and an edge connects two related candidates.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Another unsupervised approach to keyphrase extraction involves grouping the candidate keyphrases in a document into topics , such that each topic is composed of all and only those candidate keyphrases that are related to that topic [ 13 , 33 , 32 ].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Overgeneration errors occur when a system correctly predicts a candidate as a keyphrase because it contains a word that appears frequently in the associated document, but at the same time erroneously outputs other candidates as keyphrases because they contain the same word.</a>
