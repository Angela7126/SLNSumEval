<a href="#1" id="1">However, we know of no prior work on how to display grammatical relations so that they can be easily recognized.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One current presentation (not used with auto-suggest) is to name the relation and show blanks where the words that satisfy it would appear as in X is the subject of Y [ 14 ] ; we used this as the baseline presentation in our experiments because it employs the relation definitions found in the Stanford Dependency Parser ’ s manual [ 4 ].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Following the principle of recognition over recall, we hypothesized that showing contextualized usage examples would make the relations more recognizable.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our results confirm that showing examples in the form of words or phrases significantly improves the accuracy with which grammatical relationships are recognized over the standard baseline of showing the relation name with blanks.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our findings also showed that clausal relationships, which span longer distances in sentences, benefited significantly more from example phrases than either of the other treatments.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The choices were displayed in 3 different ways (Figure 4.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The baseline presentation (Figure 4 ) named the linguistic relation and showed a blank space with a pink background for the varying word in the relationship, the focus word highlighted in yellow and underlined, and any necessary additional words necessary to convey the relationship (such as “ of ” for the prepositional relationship “ of ” , the third option.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The words presentation showed the baseline design, and in addition beneath was the word “ Examples ” followed by a list of 4 example words that could fill in the pink blank slot (Figure 4.</a>
