<a href="#0" id="0">Following up on recent work on establishing a mapping between vector-based semantic embeddings of words and the visual representations of the corresponding objects from natural images, we first present a simple approach to cross-modal vector-based semantics for the task of zero-shot learning , in which an image of a previously unseen object is mapped to a linguistic representation denoting its word.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this setting, we assume that our system possesses linguistic and visual information for a set of concepts in the form of text-based representations of words and image-based vectors of the corresponding objects, used for vision-to-language-mapping training.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">2013 ) use linear regression to transform vector-based image representations onto vectors representing the same concepts in linguistic semantic space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Objects corresponding to concepts are represented in visual terms by vectors in an image-based semantic space (Section 4.2.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The process of learning to map objects to the their word label is implemented by training a projection function f proj v ‚Üí w from the visual onto the linguistic semantic space.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For the learning, we use a set of N s seen concepts for which we have both image-based visual representations ùêï s ‚àà‚Ñù N s √ó d v and text-based linguistic representations ùêñ s ‚àà‚Ñù N s √ó d w.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The 71 seen concepts correspond to 42,600 distinct visual vectors and are used to induce the projection function.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The zero-shot framework leads us to frame fast mapping as the task of projecting visual representations of new objects onto language space for retrieving their word labels ( v ‚Üí w.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We implement this second setup ( w ‚Üí v ) by training the projection function f proj w ‚Üí v which maps linguistic vectors to visual ones.</a>
