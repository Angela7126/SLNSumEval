<a href="#0" id="0">One of the advantages conferred by the quantification of semantic similarity is that lexical items can be precisely considered in relation to each other, and by aggregating the similarity information for all items in the distribution, we can produce a visual representation of the structure of the semantic domain of the construction in order to observe how verbs in that domain are related to each other, and to immediately identify the regions of the semantic space that are densely populated (with tight clusters of verbs), and those that are more sparsely populated (fewer and/or more scattered verbs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This result illustrates the role of type frequency in syntactic productivity a measure of density that is supported by a higher number of types makes better prediction than a measure supported by fewer types.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This means that productivity not only hinges on how the existing semantic space relates to the novel item, it also occurs more reliably when this relation is attested by more items.</a>
