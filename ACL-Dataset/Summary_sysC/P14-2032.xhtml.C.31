<a href="#1" id="1">Our dual decomposition method outperforms both the word-based and character-based baselines consistently across all four subsets in both F 1 and oov recall (R oov.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our method demonstrates a robustness across domains and segmentation standards regardless of which baseline model was stronger.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Of particular note is DD â€™ s is much more robust in R oov , where the two baselines swing a lot.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This is an important property for downstream applications such as entity recognition.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The DD algorithm is also more consistent, which would likely lead to improvements in applications such as machine translation [ 3 ].</a>
