<a href="#0" id="0">To extract possible candidates, two similarity calculation methods are carried out title matching and title similarity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In our title matching method, we formulate candidate selection as an English-Chinese cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) problem [ 8 ] , in which every English articleâs title is treated as a query and all the articles in the Chinese encyclopedia are treated as the documents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the title similarity method, every Chinese article title is represented as a vector, and each distinct character in all these titles is a dimension of all vectors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The title of each English article is translated into Chinese and represented as a vector.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then, cosine similarity between this vector and the vector of each Chinese title is measured as title similarity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The second stage of our approach is to score each viable candidate using a supervised learning method, and then sort all candidates in order of score from high to low as final output.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In order to generate the gold standard evaluation sets of correct English and Chinese article pairs, we automatically collect English-Chinese inter-language links from Wikipedia.</a>
