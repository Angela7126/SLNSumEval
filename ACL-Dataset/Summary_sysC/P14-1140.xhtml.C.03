<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we propose a novel recursive recurrent neural network (R 2 NN) to model the end-to-end decoding process for statistical machine translation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A semi-supervised training approach is proposed to train the parameters, and the phrase pair embedding is explored to model translation confidence directly.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Word embedding is used as the input to learn translation confidence score, which is combined with commonly used features in the conventional log-linear model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">So as to model the translation confidence for a translation phrase pair, we initialize the phrase pair embedding by leveraging the sparse features and recurrent neural network.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, we split the phrase pair embedding into two parts to model the translation confidence directly translation confidence with sparse features and translation confidence with recurrent neural network.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We first get two translation confidence vectors separately using sparse features and recurrent neural network, and then concatenate them to be the phrase pair embedding.</a>
