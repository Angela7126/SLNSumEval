<a href="#0" id="0">In order to perform prediction subject to various global constraints, we may need to augment the problem ( 1 ) with additional constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Dual Decomposition is a popular method for performing MAP inference in this scenario, since it leverages known algorithms for MAP in the base problem where these extra constraints have not been added [ 11 , 20 , 18 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this case, the MAP problem can be formulated as a structured linear model similar to equation ( 1 ), for which we have a MAP algorithm, but where we have imposed some additional constraints A ⁢ y ≤ b that no longer allow us to use the algorithm.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We consider all constraints of the forms z ⁢ ( i , j ) ≤ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 and z ⁢ ( i , j ) ≥ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We then use the development set to learn the penalties for the soft constraints, using the perceptron algorithm described in section 3.1.</a>
