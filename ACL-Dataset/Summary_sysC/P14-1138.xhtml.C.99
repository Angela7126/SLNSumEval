<a href="#1" id="1">For example, the HMM model identifies the Viterbi alignment using the Viterbi algorithm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As an instance of discriminative models, we describe an FFNN-based word alignment model [ 40 ] , which is our baseline.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The Viterbi alignment is determined using the Viterbi algorithm, similar to the FFNN-based model, where the model is sequentially applied from f 1 to f J 5 5 Strictly speaking, we cannot apply the dynamic programming forward-backward algorithm (i.e.,, the Viterbi algorithm) due to the long alignment history of y i.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, the Viterbi alignment is computed approximately using heuristic beam search.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To employ more discriminative negative samples, our implementation samples each word of 𝒆 - from a set of the target words that co-occur with f i ∈𝒇 + whose probability is above a threshold C under the IBM Model 1 incorporating l 0 prior [ 37 ].</a>
