<a href="#0" id="0">Taking inspiration from recent work in sentiment analysis that successfully models the compositional aspect of language, we apply a recursive neural network ( RNN ) framework to the task of identifying the political position evinced by a sentence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">With this new dataset we show that rnn s not only label sentences well but also improve further when given additional phrase-level annotations rnn s are quantitatively more effective than existing methods that use syntactic and semantic features separately, and we also illustrate how our model correctly identifies ideological bias in complex syntactic constructions.</a>
