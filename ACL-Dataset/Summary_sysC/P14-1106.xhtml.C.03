<a href="#1" id="1">Given the two adjacent roles ùëÖ i and ùëÖ i + 1 in a PAS pas , Table 2 shows the features that are used in the semantic leftmost and rightmost reordering models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For models with syntactic reordering, we add two new features (i.e.,, one for the leftmost reordering model and the other for the rightmost reordering model) into the log-linear translation model in Eq.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the semantic reordering models, we also add two new features into the log-linear translation model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The syntactic reordering models outperform the semantic reordering models on both the baseline and MR08 systems.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally, we integrate both the syntactic and semantic reordering models into the final system.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The syntactic reordering models outperform the semantic reordering models, and the gain achieved by the semantic reordering models is limited in the presence of the MR08 syntactic features.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Table 8 shows the syntactic and semantic reordering feature weights.</a>
