<a href="#0" id="0">For both datasets, each negative set N c is constructed as ∪ c ′∈ C ∖ { c } V c ′ B , i.e.,, from the items related in BabelNet to all other concepts in C.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">By constructing N c directly from the knowledge base, play actions may be validated based on recognition of true negatives, removing the heavy burden for ever manually creating a gold standard test set.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Non-video Game with a Purpose To measure the impact of the video game itself on the annotation process, we developed a non-video game with a purpose, referred to as SuchGame.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Players perform a single action in SuchGame after being shown a concept c and its textual definition, a player answers whether an item is related to the concept.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The images used by TKT provide concrete examples of a concept, which can be easily compared with the game ’ s current concept; in addition, TKT allows players to inspect items as long as a player prefers.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For both games, players were equally likely to select novel items, suggesting the games can serve a useful purpose of adding these missing relations in automatically constructed knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">First, both games intentionally uniformly sample between V and N to increase player engagement, 4 4 Earlier versions that used mostly items from V proved less engaging due to players frequently performing the same action, e.g.,, saving most humans or collecting most pictures which generates a larger number of annotations for items in N than are produced by crowdsourcing.</a>
