<a href="#0" id="0">The limiting factor is scale with many thousands of verbs and over a hundred commonly-discussed semantic features and syntactic frames, it is not feasible for a single researcher, or even team of researchers, to check which verbs appear in which syntactic frames and carry which semantic entailments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Previous research has shown that humans find it easier to reason about real-world scenarios than make abstract judgments [ 3 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, for each feature (e.g.,, movement ), we converted the metalinguistic judgment ( “ Does this verb entail movement on the part of some entity ” ) into a real-world problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We next investigated whether our results support the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic entailments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Even a single verb may have different semantic entailments when placed in different syntactic frames.</a>
