<a href="#0" id="0">This paper presents an approach to query construction to detect multilingual dictionaries for predetermined language combinations on the web, based on the identification of terms which are likely to occur in bilingual dictionaries but not in general web documents.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Below, we describe our methodology for query construction based on these elements in greater detail.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The only assumption on the method is that we have access to a selection of dictionaries D (mono- or multilingual) and a corpus of conventional (non-dictionary) documents C , and knowledge of the language(s) contained in each dictionary and document.</a>
