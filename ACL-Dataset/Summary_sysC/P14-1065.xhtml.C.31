<a href="#0" id="0">We present experiments in using discourse structure for improving machine translation evaluation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all-subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, we show that these measures can help improve a number of existing machine translation evaluation metrics both at the segment- and at the system-level.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Rather than proposing a single new metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, and thus should be taken into account in the development of future richer evaluation metrics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, rather than proposing yet another MT evaluation metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to many existing evaluation metrics, and thus should not be ignored.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use DTs generated by a publicly-available discourse parser [] ; then, we show that they can help improve a number of MT evaluation metrics at the segment- and at the system-level in the context of the WMT11 and the WMT12 metrics shared tasks [].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this section, we explore how discourse information can be used to improve machine translation evaluation metrics.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Below we present the evaluation results at the system- and segment-level, using our two basic metrics on discourse trees (Section 3.1 ), which are referred to as DR and DR- lex.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The results are shown in Table 4.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">As in previous sections we present the average results over all four language pairs.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">We can see that the tuned combinations with DR- lex improve over most of the individual metrics in groups II and III.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Interestingly, the tuned combinations that include the much weaker metric DR now improve over 12 out of 13 of the individual metrics in groups II and III, and only slightly degrades the score of the 13th one ( spede07pP.</a>
