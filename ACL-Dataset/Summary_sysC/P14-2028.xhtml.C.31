<a href="#0" id="0">Hypotheses generator is based on A* beam search in a trie of words, and yields K hypotheses h k , for which the noisy channel scores P dist ( h k → q 1 ) P LM ( h k ) are highest possible.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hypotheses generator has high K-best recall (see Section 4.2 ) — in 91.8% cases the correct hypothesis is found when K = 30 , which confirms the assumption about covering almost all posterior probability mass (see Equation 2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On the ” hard ” dataset the performance of the noisy channel and the iterative methods is inferior to our proposed method, see Figure 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We tested all three methods on the ” common ” dataset as well to evaluate if our handling of hard cases affects the performance of our approach on the common cases of spelling error.</a>
