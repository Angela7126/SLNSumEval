<a href="#0" id="0">2013 ) , it is not feasible to use a long chain to represent all constituents, due to the fact that it takes O ⁢ ( T ⁢ M 2 ) time to perform the forward-backward exact inference on a chain with T units and an output vocabulary size of M , thus the overall complexity for all possible sequences in their model is O ⁢ ( M 2 ⁢ n 3 ) 2 2 The time complexity will be reduced to O ⁢ ( M 2 ⁢ n 2 ) , if we use the same chain for all constituents as in our M i ⁢ n ⁢ t ⁢ r ⁢ a s ⁢ t ⁢ r ⁢ u ⁢ c ⁢ t.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Starting from the EDUs on the bottom level, we need to perform inference for one chain on each level during the bottom-up tree-building, and thus the total time complexity is Σ i = 1 m k ⁢ O ⁢ ( m k - i ) = O ⁢ ( m k 2 ).</a>
