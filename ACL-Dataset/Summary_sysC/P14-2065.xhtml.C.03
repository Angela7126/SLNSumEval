<a href="#0" id="0">That is, all verbs in the same class appear in the same set of syntactic frames.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Importantly, the semantics listed here is not just for the verb spray but applies to all verbs from the Spray Class whenever they appear in that syntactic frame â€“ that is, VerbNet assumes the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">That is, ideally there would be some database of semantic judgments for a comprehensive set of verbs from each syntactic class.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As such, this task provides a lower bound for how much semantic consistency one might expect within a syntactic verb class.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic entailments.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Even a single verb may have different semantic entailments when placed in different syntactic frames.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We then considered how many verbs in each class had the same annotation in any given syntactic frame.</a>
