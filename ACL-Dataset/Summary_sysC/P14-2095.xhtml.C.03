<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a novel approach to cross-lingual model transfer based on feature representation projection.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The approach proposed here, which we will refer to as feature representation projection ( FRP ), constitutes an alternative to direct model transfer and annotation projection and can be seen as a compromise between the two.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Instead of designing this representation manually, however, we create compact monolingual feature representations for source and target languages separately and automatically estimate the mapping between the two from parallel data.</a>
