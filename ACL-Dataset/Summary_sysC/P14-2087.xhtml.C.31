<a href="#1" id="1">In contrast to string matching, the probabilistic nature of our model offers a “ softer ” measurement of gloss-context association, resulting in a novel approach to unsupervised WSD with state-of-the-art performance in more than one WSD benchmark (Section 4.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In one of their simplest forms, e i ’ s correspond to co-occurring words in the instance of w , and f j ’ s consist of the gloss words of sense s.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Consequently, p ( 𝐟𝐞 ) is essentially measuring the association between context words of w and definition texts of s , i.e.,, the gloss-context association in the simplified Lesk algorithm.</a>
