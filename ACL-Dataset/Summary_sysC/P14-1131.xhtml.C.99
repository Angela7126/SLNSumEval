<a href="#0" id="0">SimRank is based on the simple intuition that nodes in a graph should be considered as similar to the extent that their neighbors are similar.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Unfortunately, SimRank has time complexity 𝒪⁢ ( n 3 ) (where n is the number of nodes in the graph) and therefore does not scale to the large graphs that are typical of NLP.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Whereas SimRank sets each of these entries back to one at each iteration, CoSimRank adds one.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We are not including this method in our experiments, but we will give the equation here, as traditional document similarity measures (e.g.,, cosine similarity) perform poorly on this task although there also are known alternatives with good results [ 30 ].</a>
