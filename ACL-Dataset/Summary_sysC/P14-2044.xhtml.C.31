<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper we present a new approach for inducing part-of-speech (POS) classes, combining morphological and distributional information in a non-parametric Bayesian generative model based on the distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP; Blei and Frazier, 2011.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In the ddCRP, each data point (word type) selects another point to “ follow ” ; this chain of following links corresponds to a partition of the data points into clusters.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The probability of word w 1 following w 2 depends on two factors.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">1) the distributional similarity between all words in the proposed partition containing w 1 and w 2 , which is encoded using a Gaussian likelihood function over the word embeddings; and 2) the morphological similarity between w 1 and w 2 , which acts as a prior distribution on the induced clustering.</a>
