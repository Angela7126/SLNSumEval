<a href="#1" id="1">Node have ( Tom has an animal that Mary loves F 4 = 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞∩ ( 𝐓𝐨𝐦𝚂𝚄𝙱𝙹 × ( F 3 ) 𝙾𝙱𝙹 ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Where 𝒯Τ i is the subtree of 𝒯 rooted at Τ i , and R Σ is the set of possible semantic roles for content word w ⁢ ( Σ ) (e.g., R 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞 = { 𝚂𝚄𝙱𝙹 , 𝙾𝙱𝙹 } ), and W R Σ∖ r i is the product of W which has dimension R Σ∖ r i (e.g., W { 𝚂𝚄𝙱𝙹 , 𝙾𝙱𝙹 } ∖𝚂𝚄𝙱𝙹 = W 𝙾𝙱𝙹.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">After the abstract denotation [[ 𝒯 ]] is calculated, the statement representing the meaning of the sentence is defined as [[ 𝒯 ]] ≠∅.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For example, the statement of “ students read books ” is 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝∩ ( 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝚂𝚄𝙱𝙹 × 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤𝙾𝙱𝙹 ) ≠∅ , and the statement of “ Mary loves every dog ” is q ⊂𝙾𝙱𝙹⁢ ( Π𝙾𝙱𝙹⁢ ( F 2 ) , 𝐝𝐨𝐠 ) ≠∅ , which is logically equivalent to 𝐝𝐨𝐠⊂Π𝙾𝙱𝙹⁢ ( F 2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">10 10 See Footnote 2,3.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Tom has a dog F 6 = 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞∩ ( 𝐓𝐨𝐦𝚂𝚄𝙱𝙹 × 𝐝𝐨𝐠𝙾𝙱𝙹.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Objects that Tom has F 7 = Π𝙾𝙱𝙹⁢ ( 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞∩ ( 𝐓𝐨𝐦𝚂𝚄𝙱𝙹 × W 𝙾𝙱𝙹 ) ).</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We can use the lexical knowledge 𝐝𝐨𝐠⊂𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐥 , the statements of T (i.e., 𝐝𝐨𝐠⊂Π𝙾𝙱𝙹⁢ ( F 2 ) and F 6 ≠∅ ), and the axioms in Table 3 , 11 11 Algebraic identities, such as Π𝙾𝙱𝙹⁢ ( F 4 ) = F 3 ∩ F 7 and Π𝙾𝙱𝙹⁢ ( F 6 ) = 𝐝𝐨𝐠∩ F 7 , are also axioms to prove the statement of H (i.e., F 4 ≠∅ ) (Figure 3.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For example, the abstract denotation of germ 𝙰𝚁𝙶⁢ ( 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 ) in Figure 1 is defined as Π𝙰𝚁𝙶⁢ ( 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤∩Π𝙾𝙱𝙹⁢ ( 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝∩ ( 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝚂𝚄𝙱𝙹 × 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤𝙾𝙱𝙹 ) ) ) , meaning “ books read by students ”.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Similarly, denotation of germ 𝙾𝙱𝙹⁢ ( 𝐛𝐥𝐚𝐦𝐞 ) in T of Figure 5 indicates the object of “ blame ” as in the sentence “ Tropical storm Debby is blamed for death ” , which is a tropical storm , is Debby , etc.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">Technically, each germ in a DCS tree indicates a variable when the DCS tree is translated to a FOL formula, and the abstract denotation of the germ corresponds to the set of consistent values [] of that variable.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The logical clue to align germs is if there exists an abstract denotation, other than W , that is a superset of both abstract denotations of two germs, then the two germs can be aligned.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">Accepted aligned paths are converted into statements, which are used as new knowledge.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">The conversion is done by first performing a DCS tree transformation according to the aligned paths, and then declare a subsumption relation between the denotations of aligned germs.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">For example, to apply the aligned path pair generated in Figure 5 , we use it to transform T into a new tree T ’ (Figure 6 ), and then the aligned germs, OBJ ( blame ) in T and SUBJ ( cause ) in T ’ , will generate the on-the-fly knowledge.</a>
