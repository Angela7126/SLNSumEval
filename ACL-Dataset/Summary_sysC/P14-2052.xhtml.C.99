<a href="#0" id="0">First, we represent a document as a nested tree , which is composed of two types of tree structures a document tree and a sentence tree.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The document tree is a tree that has sentences as nodes and head modifier relationships between sentences obtained by RST as edges.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The sentence tree is a tree that has words as nodes and head modifier relationships between words obtained by the dependency parser as edges.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We can build the nested tree by regarding each node of the document tree as a sentence tree.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, we formulate the problem of single document summarization as that of combinatorial optimization, which is based on the trimming of the nested tree.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Figure 4 has two example sentences for which both methods selected a subtree as part of a summary.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The { ⋅ } indicates the parser ’ s root word.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The [ ⋅ ] indicates the word that the system selected as the root of the subtree.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Subtree selection selected a root in both examples that differed from the parser ’ s root.</a>
