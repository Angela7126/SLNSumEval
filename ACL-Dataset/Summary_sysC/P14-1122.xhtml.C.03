<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a cost-effective method of validating and extending knowledge bases using video games with a purpose.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Two video games were created to validate concept-concept and concept-image relations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we propose validating and extending semantic knowledge bases using video games with a purpose.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Here, the annotation tasks are transformed into elements of a video game where players accomplish their jobs by virtue of playing the game, rather than by performing a more traditional annotation task.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In contrast, we introduce two video games with graphical 2D gameplay that is similar to what game players are familiar with.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The fun nature of the games provides an intrinsic motivation for players to keep playing, which can increase the quality of their work and lower the cost per annotation.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Second, we demonstrate that converting games with a purpose into more traditional video games creates an increased player incentive such that players annotate for free, thereby significantly lowering annotation costs below that of crowdsourcing.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Two games with a purpose have incorporated video game-like mechanics for annotation.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">However, players must distinguish pictures of the tower â€™ s concept from unrelated pictures.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">For both games, players were equally likely to select novel items, suggesting the games can serve a useful purpose of adding these missing relations in automatically constructed knowledge bases.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Last, while crowdsourcing has seen different quality and volume from workers in paid and unpaid settings [ 28 ] , in contrast, our games produced approximately-equivalent results from players in both settings.</a>
