<a href="#0" id="0">We used both dependency between words and dependency between sentences by constructing a nested tree, in which nodes in the document tree representing dependency between sentences were replaced by a sentence tree representing dependency between words.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We can build the nested tree by regarding each node of the document tree as a sentence tree.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In particular, we extract a rooted document subtree from the document tree, and sentence subtrees from sentence trees in the document tree.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We denote by r i ⁢ j the variable that is one if word i ⁢ j is selected as a root of an extracting sentence subtree.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Constraint ( 5 ) guarantees that each selected sentence subtree has at least Θ words.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Constraint ( 10 ) guarantees that the parser ’ s root node will only be selected when the system extracts a rooted sentence subtree.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We counted the number of sentences in the source document that each method used to generate a summary 5 5 Note that the number for the EDU method is not equal to selected textual units because a sentence in the source document may contain multiple EDUs.</a>
