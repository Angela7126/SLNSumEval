<a href="#0" id="0">We develop a rich set of context-aware posterior constraints for sentence-level sentiment analysis by exploiting lexical and discourse knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Specifically, we construct the lexical constraints by extracting sentiment-bearing patterns within sentences and construct the discourse-level constraints by extracting discourse relations that indicate sentiment coherence or sentiment changes both within and across sentences.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This confirms that encoding lexical and discourse knowledge as posterior constraints allows the feature-based model to gain additional learning power for sentence-level sentiment prediction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When combining discourse constraints with features from different sentences, the PR model becomes more powerful in disambiguating sentiment.</a>
