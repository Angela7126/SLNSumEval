<a href="#0" id="0">This paper describes a new approach to predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context, i.e.,, whether a verb is used in a stative or dynamic sense.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We identify two challenging cases of this problem when the verb is unseen in training data, and when the verb is ambiguous for aspectual class.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While most verbs have one predominant interpretation, others are more flexible for aspectual class and can occur as either stative ( 1 ) or dynamic ( 1 ) depending on the context.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our work differs from prior work in that we treat the problem as a three-way classification task, predicting dynamic , stative or both as the aspectual class of a verb in context.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context ( stative , dynamic , both ), we assume a supervised learning setting and explore features mined from a large background corpus, distributional features, and instance-based features.</a>
