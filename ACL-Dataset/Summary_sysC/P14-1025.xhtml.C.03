<a href="#0" id="0">Such an approach requires knowledge of predominant senses; however, word sense distributions — and predominant senses too — vary from corpus to corpus.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Because of domain differences and the skewed nature of word sense distributions, it is often the case that some senses in a sense inventory will not be attested in a given corpus.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We further propose a method for applying our sense distribution acquisition system to the task of finding unattested senses — i.e.,, senses that are in the sense inventory but not attested in a given corpus.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Corpus instances of a word can also correspond to senses that are not present in a given sense inventory.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Much of this work has been focused on ranking word senses to find the predominant sense in a given corpus [ 16 ] , which is a very powerful heuristic approach to wsd.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We interpret each topic as a sense of the target lemma.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The predominant sense and distribution across senses for each target lemma was obtained by aggregating over the sense annotations.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The authors evaluated their method in terms of wsd accuracy over a given corpus, based on assigning all instances of a target word with the predominant sense learned from that corpus.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A natural question to ask is whether our method can be used to predict word senses that are missing from our sense inventory, and identify usages associated with each such missing sense.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Note that we do not consider high-frequency senses with frequency higher than 0.6, as it is rare for a medium- to high-frequency word to take on a novel sense which is then the predominant sense in a given corpus.</a>
