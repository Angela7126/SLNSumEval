<a href="#0" id="0">Driven by this observation, our main hypothesis is that the discourse structure of NF answers provides complementary information to state-of-the-art QA models that measure the similarity (either lexical and/or semantic) between question and answer.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The values of the discourse features are the mean of the similarity scores (e.g.,, cosine similarity using tf.idf weighting) of the two marker arguments and the corresponding question.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Second, these features model the intensity of the match between the text surrounding the discourse structure and the question text using both the assigned argument labels and the feature values.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">That this absolute performance increase is nearly identical indicates that LS features are complementary to and additive with the full discourse model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For the Bio corpus where answer candidates consist of entire paragraphs of a biology text, overall performance is dominated by inter-sentence discourse features.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">This way, the DMM and DPM features jointly capture discourse structures and semantic similarity between answer segments and question.</a>
