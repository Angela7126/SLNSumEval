<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a novel text normalization model based on learning edit operations from labeled data while incorporating features induced from unlabeled data via character-level neural text embeddings.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Once trained the model is used to label new strings and the predicted edit script is applied to the input string producing the normalized output string.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We use SRNs to induce character-level text representations from unlabeled Twitter data to use as features in the string transduction model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We use them to bring in information from unlabeled data into our string transduction model and then train a character-level SRN language model on unlabeled tweets.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The trained SRN language model can be used to generate random text by sampling the next byte from its predictive distribution and extending the string with the result.</a>
