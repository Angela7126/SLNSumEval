<a href="#0" id="0">This paper investigates how linguistic resources and extra-linguistic factors affect perceptions of the certainty of quoted information in Twitter.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We present a new dataset of Twitter messages that use FactBank predicates (e.g.,, claim , say , insist ) to scope the claims of named entity sources.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This dataset was annotated by Mechanical Turk workers who gave ratings for the factuality of the scoped claims in each Twitter message.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This enables us to build a predictive model of the factuality annotations, with the goal of determining the full set of relevant factors, including the predicate, the source, the journalist, and the content of the claim itself.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, we find that these extra-linguistic factors do not predict readers ’ factuality judgments, suggesting that the journalist ’ s own framing plays a decisive role in the credibility of the information being conveyed.</a>
