<a href="#0" id="0">Events extracted in our proposed framework are represented as a 4-tuple ⟨ y , d , l , k ⟩ , where y stands for a non-location named entity, d for a date, l for a location, and k for an event-related keyword.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Each event mentioned in tweets can be closely depicted by this representation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It should be noted that for some events, one or more elements in their corresponding tuples might be absent as their related information is not available in tweets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Choose an event e ∼ Multinomial ( 𝝅 ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For each named entity occur in tweet 𝒘 , choose a named entity y ∼ Multinomial ( 𝜽 e ).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For each date occur in tweet 𝒘 , choose a date d ∼ Multinomial ( 𝝋 e ).</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For each location occur in tweet 𝒘 , choose a location l ∼ Multinomial ( 𝝍 e ).</a>
