<a href="#0" id="0">Based on the assumption that these linguistic changes follow certain rules, we propose a method for automatically detecting pairs of cognates employing an orthographic alignment method which proved relevant for sequence alignment in computational biology.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms in order to infer rules for linguistic changes undergone by words when entering new languages and to discriminate between cognates and non-cognates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For measuring phonetic and orthographic proximity of cognate candidates, string similarity metrics can be applied, using the phonetic or orthographic word forms as input.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Various measures were investigated and compared [ 17 , 14 ] ; Levenshtein distance [ 22 ] , XDice [ 3 ] and the longest common subsequence ratio [ 24 ] are among the most frequently used metrics in this field.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">While the purpose of cognate detection is to determine whether two given words form a cognate pair, the aim of cognate production is, given a word in a source language, to automatically produce its cognate pair in a target language.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">2013 ) proposed a method for cognate production relying on statistical character-based machine translation, learning orthographic production patterns, and Mulloni ( 2007 ) introduced an algorithm for cognate production based on edit distance alignment and the identification of orthographic cues when words enter a new language.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">According to Gusfield ( 1997 ) , an edit transcript (representing the conversion of one string to another) and an alignment are mathematically equivalent ways of describing relationships between strings.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Therefore, because the edit distance was widely used in this research area and produced good results, we are encouraged to employ orthographic alignment for identifying pairs of cognates, not only to compute similarity scores, as was previously done, but to use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We investigate the performance of the method we propose in comparison to previous approaches for automatic detection of cognate pairs based on orthographic similarity.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">First, we compute the pairwise distances between pairs of words for each orthographic metric individually, as a single feature 5 5 SpSim cannot be computed directly, as the other metrics, so we introduce an additional step in which we use 1/3 of the training set (only cognates are needed) to learn orthographic changes.</a>
