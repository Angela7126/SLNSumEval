<a href="#0" id="0">Specifically, given a corpus consisting of both machine-translated English text (English being the target language) and native English text (not necessarily the reference translation of the machine-translated text), we measure the accuracy of the system in classifying the sentences in the corpus as machine-translated or not.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This accuracy will be shown to decrease as the quality of the underlying MT system increases.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We conduct the same classification experiment as above, with features based on function words and POS tags, and SMO-based SVM as the classifier.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We first use 3000 reference sentences from the WMT13 â€™ English reference translations, against the matching 3000 output sentences from one MT system at a time, resulting in 6000 sentence instances per experiment.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As can be seen in Figure 3 , the detection accuracy is strongly correlated with the evaluations scores, yielding R 2 = 0.774.</a>
