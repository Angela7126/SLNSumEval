<a href="#0" id="0">The focus of this study is the design and performance analysis of a measure of the syntactic complexity of non-native English responses for use in automatic scoring systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The state-of-the art automated scoring system for spontaneous speech [ 38 , 15 ] currently uses measures of fluency and pronunciation (acoustic aspects) to produce scores that are in reasonable agreement with human-rated scores of proficiency.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Despite its good performance, there is a need to extend its coverage to higher order aspects of language ability.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Fluency and pronunciation may, by themselves, already be good indicators of proficiency in non-native speakers, but from a construct validity perspective 1 1 Construct validity is the degree to which a test measures what it claims, or purports, to be measuring and an important criterion in the development and use of assessments or tests it is necessary that an automatic assessment model measure higher-order aspects of language proficiency.</a>
