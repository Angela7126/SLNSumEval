<a href="#0" id="0">Before we present the algorithm integrating the reordering models, we define the following functions by assuming XP i and XP i + 1 are the constituent pair of interest in CFG rule cfg , H is the translation hypothesis and a is its word alignment.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To get the two semantic reordering model feature values, we simply use Algorithm 1 and its associated functions from ℱ 1 to ℱ 5 replacing a CFG rule cfg with a PAS pas , and a constituent 𝑋𝑃 i with a semantic role 𝑅 i.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Algorithm 1 therefore permits a unified treatment of syntactic and PAS-based reordering, even though it is expressed in terms of syntactic reordering here for ease of presentation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The reordering type distribution on the reordering model training data in Table 3 suggests that semantic reordering is more difficult than syntactic reordering.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 7 shows the accuracy averaged over the four gold reordering sets (the four reference translations.</a>
