<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we focus on abbreviation expansion for TTS, which requires a “ do no harm ” , high precision approach yielding few expansion errors at the cost of leaving relatively many abbreviations unexpanded.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To predict the expansion given the context, we extract n-gram observations for full words in the TTS lexicon.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the “ SVM ” model, we extract features from the log likelihood and log odds scores associated with contextual n-grams, as well as from the pair LM probability and characteristics of the abbreviation itself.</a>
