<a href="#0" id="0">If a word undergoes a sense change, this can be detected by comparing its senses obtained from two different time periods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">If a word undergoes sense change, this can be detected by comparing the sense clusters obtained from two different time periods by the algorithm outlined above.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let C i = { s i ⁢ 1 , s i ⁢ 2 , … , s i ⁢ m } and C j = { s j ⁢ 1 , s j ⁢ 2 , … , s j ⁢ n } , where s k ⁢ z denotes z t ⁢ h sense cluster for word w during time interval t ⁢ v k.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We hypothesize that word w can undergo sense change from one time interval ( t ⁢ v i ) to another ( t ⁢ v j ) as per one of the following scenarios.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">K = m + 1 , 1 ≤ l ≤ n denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s j ⁢ l , that were not present in any of the m clusters in t ⁢ v i.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">1 ≤ k ≤ m , l = n + 1 denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s i ⁢ k , that did not show up in any of the n clusters in t ⁢ v j.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Formally, we consider a sense change from t ⁢ v i to t ⁢ v j stable if it was also detected while comparing t ⁢ v i with the following time periods t ⁢ v k s.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Similarly, for a candidate sense change from t ⁢ v i to t ⁢ v j , we say that the location of the sense change is t ⁢ v j if and only if that sense change does not get detected by comparing t ⁢ v i with any time interval t ⁢ v k , intermediate between t ⁢ v i and t ⁢ v j.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Table 1 gives a lot of candidate words for sense change.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Columns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term ‘ birth cluster ’ for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes.</a>
