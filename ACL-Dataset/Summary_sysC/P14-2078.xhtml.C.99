<a href="#0" id="0">One of the classical approach to conduct the disambiguation process in NED applications is to consider the context of the mention to be mapped, and compare this context with contextual information about the potential target entities (see for instance the KIM system [ 18 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">1) the ontology used to evaluate the relatedness of candidates is replaced by internal links and categories from the Wikipedia corpus; 2) the coherence of entities is improved prior to the calculation of semantic relatedness using a co-reference resolution algorithm, and a NE label correction method; 3) the proposed method is robust enough to improve the performance of existing entity linking annotation engines, which are capable of providing a set of ranked candidates for each annotation in a document.</a>
