<a href="#0" id="0">We also present a new publicly available dataset of learner sentences judged for grammaticality on an ordinal scale.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we develop a system for the task of predicting the grammaticality of sentences, and present a dataset of learner sentences rated for grammaticality.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We create a dataset of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences written by English language learners, labeled on an ordinal scale for grammaticality.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Each sentence was annotated on a scale from 1 to 4 as described below, with 4 being the most grammatical.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Every sentence judged on the 1 – 4 scale must be a clause.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We use ℓ 2 -regularized linear regression (i.e.,, ridge regression) to learn a model of sentence grammaticality from a variety of linguistic features.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We report performance in terms of Pearson ’ s r between the averaged 1 – 4 human labels and unrounded system predictions.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Evaluating on a binary scale allows us to measure how well the system distinguishes grammatical sentences from ungrammatical ones.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For the ordinal task, we report Pearson ’ s r between the averaged human judgments and each system.</a>
