<a href="#0" id="0">Referring to Figure 1 , whose timeline is shown in Figure 2 , we see that the time span with the most number of events is when the latest cyclone made landfall.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Let T ⁢ S L be the time span with the largest number of events in a timeline.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The importance of a time span T ⁢ S i is computed by normalizing the number of events in T ⁢ S i against the number of events in T ⁢ S L.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">T ⁢ S w is the number of events within the time span.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Suppose a sentence contains events which are associated with time spans T ⁢ S a , T ⁢ S b , T ⁢ S c.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then the temporal coverage of a sentence is defined as the number of time spans between the earliest time span T ⁢ S a and the latest time span T ⁢ S c.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Formally, if a sentence s contains events 𝔼 s = { e 1 , … , e n } , where each event is associated with a time span T ⁢ S i , then T ⁢ C ⁢ D is computed using.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In Figure 5 , the sentences describe many events which took place within the same time span.</a>
