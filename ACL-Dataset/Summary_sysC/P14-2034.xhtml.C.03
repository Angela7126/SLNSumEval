<a href="#0" id="0">Segmentation is a common practice in Arabic NLP due to the language ’ s morphological richness.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We present a single clitic segmentation model that is accurate on both MSA and informal Arabic.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We compare our work to the original Green and DeNero model and two other Arabic segmentation systems the MADA+TOKAN toolkit v. 3.1 [ 6 ] and its Egyptian dialect variant, MADA-ARZ v. 0.4 [ 7 ].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our segmenter achieves a 95.1% F 1 segmentation score evaluated against a gold standard on Egyptian dialect data, compared to 90.8% for MADA-ARZ and 92.9% for Green and DeNero.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In particular, a few colloquial ‘‘ filler ’’ expressions are sometimes not segmented, despite being compound Arabic words that are segmented elsewhere in the data.</a>
