<a href="#0" id="0">To address this question, we split our translations into 5 bins, based on their TER g ⁢ o ⁢ l ⁢ d.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This output translation is the result of the combined translation and editing stages.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, our method operates over a heterogeneous network that includes translators and post-editors as well as the translated sentences that they produce.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We first examine the centroid-based ranking on the candidate sub-graph ( G C ) alone to see the effect of voting among translated sentences; we denote this strategy as plain ranking.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then we incorporate the standard random walk on the Turker graph ( G T ) to include the structural information but without yet including any collaboration information; that is, we incorporate information from G T and G C without including edges linking the two together.</a>
