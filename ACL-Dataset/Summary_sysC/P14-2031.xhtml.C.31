<a href="#0" id="0">With the help of Amazon Mechanical Turk 1 1 www.mturk.com , we crowdsourced annotations on a corpus of edit-turn-pairs from 26 random English Wikipedia articles in various thematic categories.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The search space for corresponding edit-turn-pairs is quite big, as any edit to an article may correspond to any turn from the article â€™ s discussion page.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Assuming that most edit-turn-pairs are non-corresponding, we expect a heavy imbalance in the class distribution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Kaltenbrunner and Laniado ( 2012 ) analyze the development of discussion pages in Wikipedia with respect to time and compare dependences between edit peaks in the revision history of the article itself and the respective discussion page.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">They find that the development of a discussion page is often bound to the topic of the article, i.e., articles on time-specific topics such as events grow much faster than discussions about timeless, encyclopedic content.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, they observed that the edit peaks in articles and their discussion pages are mostly independent.</a>
