<a href="#0" id="0">This paper presents experiments with WordNet semantic classes to improve dependency parsing.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We study the effect of semantic classes in three dependency parsers, using two types of constituency-to-dependency conversions of the English Penn Treebank.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This work presents a set of experiments to investigate the use of lexical semantic information in dependency parsing of English.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Whether semantics improve parsing is one interesting research topic both on parsing and lexical semantics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Broadly speaking, we can classify the methods to incorporate semantic information into parsers in two systems using static lexical semantic repositories, such as WordNet or similar ontologies [] , and systems using dynamic semantic clusters automatically acquired from corpora [].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Is the type of semantic information related to the type of parser.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We will test three different parsers representative of successful paradigms in dependency parsing.</a>
