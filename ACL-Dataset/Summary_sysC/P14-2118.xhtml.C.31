<a href="#0" id="0">We quantify the lexical subjectivity of adjectives using a corpus-based method, and show for the first time that it correlates with noun concreteness in large corpora.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These cognitive dimensions together influence how word meanings combine, and we exploit this fact to achieve performance improvements on the semantic classification of adjective-noun pairs.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Non-nominality.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Many adjectives also function as nouns ( sweet cake vs boiled sweet.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Unlike nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjective, and the number of adjectives in texts correlates with human judgements of their subjectivity [ 12 ].</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We therefore extract the frequency with which concepts are tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the assumption that ‘ pure ’ adjectives are on average more subjective than nominal-style adjectives.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Motivated by these observations, in the following sections we test two hypotheses.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">1) Subjective / objective adjectives are more likely to modify abstract / concrete nouns respectively.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">2) Subjectivity and concreteness can predict aspects of how adjective and noun concepts combine.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In addressing (1), we extracted the 2,000 highest-frequency nouns from the Brysbaert et al.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">To explore the relationship between concreteness, subjectivity and meaning, we plotted the 20,000 highest frequency ( a , n ) pairs in the BNC in the CONC-SUBJ semantic space (Figure 2, top.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In addition, to examine the effect of concreteness alone on adjective-noun semantics, we defined a new adjective feature.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">In this section we have outlined a set of corpus features that, taken together, enable effective approximation of adjective subjectivity.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">The results of our analyses also demonstrate a clear interaction between subjectivity and concreteness scores for nouns attributed by human raters.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Specifically, objective adjectives are more likely to modify concrete nouns and subjective adjectives are more likely to modify abstract nouns.</a>
<a href="#15" id="15">Qualitative investigations further suggest the interaction between these dimensions to be useful in the semantic characterization of adjective-noun pairs, a proposition we test formally in the next section.</a>
