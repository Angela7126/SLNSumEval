<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we propose a semantic parsing framework tailored to single-relation questions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">At the core of our approach is a novel semantic similarity model using convolutional neural networks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Leveraging the question paraphrase data mined from the WikiAnswers corpus by Fader et al.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">2013 ) , we train two semantic similarity models one links a mention from the question to an entity in the KB and the other maps a relation pattern to a relation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The answer to the question can thus be derived by finding the relation – entity triple r ⁢ ( e 1 , e 2 ) in the KB and returning the entity not mentioned in the question.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">By using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and relations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, Paralex [ 7 ] , with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The highest achievable F 1 score of our system is 0.61, versus 0.54 of Paralex.</a>
