<a href="#0" id="0">We instead attack the problem of QA from a KB from an IE perspective we learn directly the pattern of QA pairs, represented by the dependency parse of questions and the Freebase structure of answer candidates, without the use of intermediate, general purpose meaning representations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For instance, for common celebrity gossip questions like who cheated on celebrity A , it is hard for a system to find the Freebase relation celebrity.infidelity.participant as the target relation if it had not observed this pattern in training.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus assuming there is an alignment model that is able to tell how likely one relation maps to the original question, we add extra alignment-based features for the incoming and outgoing relation of each node.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">1) “ basic ” features include feature productions read off from the feature graph (Figure 1 ); 2) “ + word overlap ” adds additional features on whether sub-relations have overlap with the question; and 3) “ + CluewebMapping ” adds the ranking of relation prediction given the question according to CluewebMapping.</a>
