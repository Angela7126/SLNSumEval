<a href="#0" id="0">A potential obstacle, of course, is that automatic parsers may not be sufficiently representative of human readers, insofar as errors that a parser makes may not be problematic for human comprehension; moreover, parsers are rarely successful in fully recovering the intended interpretation for sentences of moderate length, even with carefully edited news text.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">With this simple reranking strategy and each of three different Treebank parsers, we find that it is possible to improve BLEU scores on Penn Treebank development data with White Rajkumar ’ s [ 28 , 36 ] baseline generative model, but not with their averaged perceptron model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In inspecting the results of reranking with this strategy, we observe that while it does sometimes succeed in avoiding egregious errors involving vicious ambiguities, common parsing mistakes such as PP-attachment errors lead to unnecessarily sacrificing conciseness or fluency in order to avoid ambiguities that would be easily tolerated by human readers.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, to develop a more nuanced self-monitoring reranker that is more robust to such parsing mistakes, we trained an SVM using dependency precision and recall features for all three parses, their n -best parsing results, and per-label precision and recall for each type of dependency, together with the realizer ’ s normalized perceptron model score as a feature.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">With the SVM reranker, we obtain a significant improvement in BLEU scores over White Rajkumar ’ s averaged perceptron model on both development and test data.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To improve word ordering decisions, White Rajkumar [ 36 ] demonstrated that incorporating a feature into the ranker inspired by Gibson ’ s [ 12 ] dependency locality theory can deliver statistically significant improvements in automatic evaluation scores, better match the distributional characteristics of sentence orderings, and significantly reduce the number of serious ordering errors (some involving vicious ambiguities) as confirmed by a targeted human evaluation.</a>
