<a href="#1" id="1">Polarity-based shifting As will be shown in our experiments, negators can have different shifting power when modifying a positive or a negative phrase.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, we explore the use of two different constants for these two situations, i.e.,, f ⁢ ( s ⁢ ( w → ) ) = s ⁢ ( w → ) - s ⁢ i ⁢ g ⁢ n ⁢ ( s ⁢ ( w → ) ) * C ⁢ ( s ⁢ i ⁢ g ⁢ n ⁢ ( s ⁢ ( w → ) ).</a>
