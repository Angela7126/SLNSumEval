<a href="#1" id="1">The answer to the question can thus be derived by finding the relation – entity triple r ⁢ ( e 1 , e 2 ) in the KB and returning the entity not mentioned in the question.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and relations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, Paralex [ 7 ] , with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We adapt the work of [ 8 , 15 ] for measuring the semantic distance between a question and relational triples in the KB as the core component of our semantic parsing approach.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper, we focus on using a knowledge base to answer single-relation questions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The performance of this approach depends mainly on whether the relation pattern and entity mention can be resolved correctly (e.g.,, ( 1 ), ( 1.</a>
