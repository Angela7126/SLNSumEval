<a href="#0" id="0">In our model, an extension of a previous model of joint word-form and phonetic category inference, the probability of word-forms is topic-dependent, enabling the model to find significantly better phonetic vowel categories and word-forms than a model with no semantic knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In theory, semantic information could offer a valuable cue for phoneme induction 1 1 The models in this paper do not distinguish between phonetic and phonemic categories, since they do not capture phonological processes (and there are also none present in our synthetic data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We thus use the terms interchangeably by helping infants distinguish between minimal pairs, as linguists do ( 48.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The task is to infer a set of phonetic categories and a set of lexical items on the basis of the data observed for each word token x i.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A purely distributional learner who observes a cluster of data points in the ae - eh region is likely to assume all these points belong to a single category because the distributions of the categories are so similar.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">However, a learner who attends to lexical context will notice a difference contexts that only occur with ae will be observed in one part of the ae - eh region, while contexts that only occur with eh will be observed in a different (though partially overlapping) space.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">37 ) found that topics learned from similar transcript data using a topic model were strongly correlated with immediate activities and contexts.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We therefore obtain the topic distributions used as input to the TLD model by training an LDA topic model ( 5 ) on a superset of the child-directed transcript data we use for lexical-phonetic learning, dividing the transcripts into small sections (the ‚Äò documents ‚Äô in LDA) that serve as our distinct situations ùíâ.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">As noted above, the learned document-topic distributions ùúΩ are treated as observed variables in the TLD model to represent the situational context.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">In the individual components of VM, TLD and LD have similar VC ( ‚Äú recall ‚Äù ), but TLD has higher VH ( ‚Äú precision ‚Äù ), demonstrating that the semantic information given by the topics can separate potentially ambiguous words, as hypothesized.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Overall, the contextual semantic information added in the TLD model leads to both better phonetic categorization and to a better protolexicon, especially when the input is noisier, using degraded consonants.</a>
