<a href="#0" id="0">In supervised text classification learning algorithms, the learner (a program) takes human labeled documents as input and learns a decision function that can classify a previously unseen document to one of the predefined classes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These topics are very few, when compared to the number of documents.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As the most probable words of topics are representative of the dataset, there is no need for the annotator to search for the right set of features for each class.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As LDA topics are semantically more meaningful than individual words and can be acquired easily, our approach overcomes limitations of the semi-supervised methods discussed above.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We use this new model to infer the probability distribution of each unlabeled training document over the class labels.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Let, Θ c,d be the probability of generating document d by class c.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We then sprinkle s artificial words of class label c to document d, such that s = K ∗Θ c,d for some constant K.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">We should note here that in TS-LDA, the annotator only labels a few topics and not a single document.</a>
