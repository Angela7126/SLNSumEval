<a href="#0" id="0">In this section, we first describe the standard approach that deals with the task of bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Table 4 shows the results of the standard approach on the balanced and the unbalanced breast cancer and diabetes comparable corpora.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can see that the best results are obtained by the S ⁢ o ⁢ u ⁢ r ⁢ c ⁢ e p ⁢ r ⁢ e ⁢ d approach for both comparable corpora.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This configuration which simulates the use of unbalanced corpora leads us to think that using prediction with unbalanced comparable corpora should also increase the performance of the standard approach.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this last experiment we contrast the standard approach applied to the balanced and unbalanced corpora noted B ⁢ a ⁢ l ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ c ⁢ e ⁢ d and U ⁢ n ⁢ b ⁢ a ⁢ l ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ c ⁢ e ⁢ d with the standard approach combined with the prediction model noted B ⁢ a ⁢ l ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ c ⁢ e ⁢ d + P ⁢ r ⁢ e ⁢ d ⁢ i ⁢ c ⁢ t ⁢ i ⁢ o ⁢ n and U ⁢ n ⁢ b ⁢ a ⁢ l ⁢ a ⁢ n ⁢ c ⁢ e ⁢ d + P ⁢ r ⁢ e ⁢ d ⁢ i ⁢ c ⁢ t ⁢ i ⁢ o ⁢ n.</a>
