<a href="#0" id="0">Also, we did an ablation test on dev about how additional features on the mapping between Freebase relations and the original questions help, with three feature settings.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">1) “ basic ” features include feature productions read off from the feature graph (Figure 1 ); 2) “ + word overlap ” adds additional features on whether sub-relations have overlap with the question; and 3) “ + CluewebMapping ” adds the ranking of relation prediction given the question according to CluewebMapping.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Table 4 shows that the additional CluewebMapping features improved overall F 1 by 5 ⁢ % , a 13 ⁢ % relative improvement a remarkable gain given that the model already learned a strong correlation between question types and answer types (explained more in discussion and Table 6 later.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The combination between questions and Freebase nodes captures some real gist of QA pattern typing, shown in Table 6 with sampled features and weights.</a>
