<a href="#0" id="0">The phrase-based translation model [ Koehn et al.2003 , Och and Ney2004 ] has demonstrated superior performance and been widely used in current SMT systems, and we employ our implementation on this translation model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Next, we adapt and extend some original phrase features as the input features for DAE feature learning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We assume that source phrase f = f 1 , ⋯ , f l f and target phrase e = e 1 , ⋯ , e l e include l f and l e words, respectively.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Following [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , we use the following 4 phrase features of each phrase pair [ Koehn et al.2003 ] in the phrase table as the first type of input features, bidirectional phrase translation probability ( P ( e f ) and P ( f e ) ), bidirectional lexical weighting ( L e x ( e f ) and L e x ( f e ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In summary, except for the first type of phrase feature X 1 which is used by [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , we introduce another four types of effective phrase features X 2 , X 3 , X 4 and X 5.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Now, the input original phrase features X includes 16 features in our experiments, as follows.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Except for the phrase feature X 1 [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , our introduced input features X significantly improve the DAE feature learning (row 11 vs.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">3; row 13 vs.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">5; row 16 vs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Specially, Table 4 shows the detailed effectiveness of our introduced input features for DAE feature learning, and the results show that each type of features are very effective for DAE feature learning.</a>
