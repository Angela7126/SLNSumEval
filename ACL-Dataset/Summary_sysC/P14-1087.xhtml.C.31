<a href="#1" id="1">We hypothesize that when more events happen within a particular time span, that time span is potentially more relevant for summarization.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Sentences that mention events found in such a time span should be assigned higher scores.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Referring to Figure 1 , whose timeline is shown in Figure 2 , we see that the time span with the most number of events is when the latest cyclone made landfall.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Assigning higher scores for sentences which contain events in this time span will help us to select more relevant sentences if we want a summary about the cyclone.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Contextual Time Span Importance (CTSI.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The importance of a time span may not depend solely on the number of events that happen within it.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If it is near time spans which are “ important ” (i.e.,, one that has a large number of events), it should also be of relative importance.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">A more concrete illustration of this can also be seen in Figure 1.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Sentence (2) explains that a lot of people have been evacuated prior to the cyclone making landfall.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">It is imaginable that this can be useful information to be included in a summary, even though from looking at the corresponding timeline in Figure 2 , the “ evacuated ” event falls in a time span with a low importance score (i.e.,, the time span only has one event.</a>
