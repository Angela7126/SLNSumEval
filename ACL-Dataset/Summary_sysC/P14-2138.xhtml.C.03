<a href="#0" id="0">We design an algorithm to identify the most discriminative words and the character bigrams that are indicative of such words, and perform two experiments to quantify their impact on the NLI task.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We are interested in identifying the character bigrams that are indicative of the most discriminative words in order to quantify their impact on the bigram-based classifier.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">[t] Computing the scores of words and bigrams in the data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to identify the bigrams that are indicative of the most discriminative words, we promote those that appear in the high-scoring words, and downgrade those that appear in the low-scoring words.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Some bigrams that appear often in the high-scoring words may be very common.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Algorithm 2 summarizes our method of identifying the discriminative words and indicative character bigrams.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Starting in line 7, we determine which character bigrams are representative of high scoring words.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">In this section, we describe two experiments aimed at quantifying the importance of the discriminative words and the indicative character bigrams that are identified by Algorithm 2.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The results are shown in the Discriminative Words column of Table 2.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">What is really striking is that the sets of 20 indicative character bigrams overlap substantially across different sets.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">In the first experiment, we showed that the removal of the 100 most discriminative words from the training data results in a significant drop in the accuracy of the classifier that is based exclusively on character bigrams.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">In the second experiment, we found that the majority of the most indicative character bigrams are shared among different language sets.</a>
