<a href="#0" id="0">We aim to improve spoken term detection performance by incorporating contextual information beyond traditional N-gram language models.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using this re-weighting approach we demonstrate consistent improvement in the term detection performance across all five languages in the BABEL program.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The word error rate (WER) and term detection performance are clearly correlated.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We evaluate term detection and word repetition-based re-scoring on the IARPA BABEL training and development corpora 1 1 Language collection releases IARPA-babel101-v0.4c, IARPA-babel104b-v0.4bY, IARPA-babel105b-v0.4, IARPA-babel106-v0.2g and IARPA-babel107b-v0.7 respectively for five languages Cantonese, Pashto, Turkish, Tagalog and Vietnamese [].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The primary difference between this and previous work on similar language models is the narrower focus here on the term detection task, in which we consider each search term in isolation, rather than all words in the vocabulary.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In general, we can think of using word repetitions to re-score term detection as applying a limited form of adaptive or cache language model [].</a>
