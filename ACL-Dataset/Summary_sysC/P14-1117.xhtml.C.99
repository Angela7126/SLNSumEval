<a href="#0" id="0">An approximate inference approach based on an LP relaxation of ILP-Dep.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Comparing the two approximation strategies shows a clear performance advantage for DP+LP over DP+LP â†’ MST the latter approach entails slower inference due to the overhead of running the Chu-Liu Edmonds algorithm at every dual update, and furthermore, the error introduced by approximating an integral solution results in a significant decrease in dependency recall.</a>
