<a href="#0" id="0">By providing an empirical measure of semantic similarity between words derived from lexical co-occurrences, distributional semantics not only reliably captures how the verbs in the distribution of a construction are related, but also enables the use of visualization techniques and statistical modeling to analyze the semantic development of a construction over time and identify the semantic determinants of syntactic productivity in naturally occurring data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Coverage relates to how the semantic domain of a construction is populated in the vicinity of a given target coinage, and in particular to the density of the semantic space.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To answer these questions, I will analyze the distribution of the construction from a semantic point of view by using a measure of semantic similarity derived from distributional information.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The resulting matrix, which contains the distributional information (in 4,683 columns) for 92 verbs occurring in the hell -construction, constitutes the semantic space under consideration in this case study.</a>
