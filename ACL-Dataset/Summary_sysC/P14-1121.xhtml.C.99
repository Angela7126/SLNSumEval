<a href="#1" id="1">For instance, the historical context-based projection method [ 11 , 28 ] , known as the standard approach , dedicated to this task seems implicitly to lead to work with balanced comparable corpora in the same way as for parallel corpora (i.e., each part of the corpus is composed of the same amount of data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper we want to show that the assumption that comparable corpora should be balanced for bilingual lexicon extraction task is unfounded.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We can also note that the MAP of all the unbalanced comparable corpora is always higher than any individual comparable corpus.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Overall, starting with a MAP of 26.1% as provided by the balanced [ breast cancer corpus 1 ] , we are able to increase it to 42.3% with the unbalanced [ breast cancer corpus 12 ] (the variation observed for some unbalanced corpora such as [ diabetes corpus 12, 13 and 14 ] can be explained by the fact that adding more data in the source language increases the error rate of the translation phase of the standard approach, which leads to the introduction of additional noise in the translated context vectors.</a>
