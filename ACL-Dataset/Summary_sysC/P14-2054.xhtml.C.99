<a href="#0" id="0">Our method extends Eisner ’ s cubic time parsing algorithm by adding signatures to each span, which indicate the number of deleted words and the rightmost kept word within the span, resulting in O ⁢ ( n 6 ) time complexity and O ⁢ ( n 4 ) space complexity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We define the sentence compression task as given a sentence composed of n words, 𝐱 = x 1 , … , x n , and a length L ≤ n , we need to remove ( n - L ) words from 𝐱 , so that the sum of the weights of the dependency tree and word bigrams of the remaining part is maximized.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For each combination, the algorithm enumerates the number of virtual arcs in the left and right spans, and the split position (e.g.,, k ′ , k ′′ , r in case 2), thus it takes O ⁢ ( n 3 ) running time.</a>
