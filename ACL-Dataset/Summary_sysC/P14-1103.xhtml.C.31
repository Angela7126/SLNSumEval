<a href="#0" id="0">To learn Con , we propose a data-driven markedness constraint learning system that avoids both innateness and tractability issues.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Unlike previous OT learning methods, which assume known constraint definitions and only learn the relative strength of these constraints, the IBPOT learns constraint violation profiles and weights for them simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The constraints are derived from sets of violations that effectively explain the observed data, rather than being selected from a pre-existing set of possible constraints.</a>
