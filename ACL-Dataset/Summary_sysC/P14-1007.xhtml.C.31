<a href="#0" id="0">The example in ( 1 ) nicely illustrates the strengths of the MRS Crawler and of the abstraction provided by the deep linguistic analysis made possible by the ERG.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The negated verb in that sentence is know , and its first semantic argument is The German.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This semantic dependency is directly and explicitly represented in the MRS, but the phrase expressing the dependent is not adjacent to the head in the string.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Furthermore, even a system using syntactic structure to model scope would be faced with a more complicated task than our crawling rules.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">At the level of syntax the dependency is mediated by both verb phrase coordination and the control verb profess , as well as by the semantically empty infinitival marker to.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The system we propose is very similar in spirit to that of \citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Both systems map from logical forms with explicit representations of scope of negation out to string-based annotations in the format provided by the Shared Task gold standard.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The main points of difference are in the robustness of the system and in the degree of tailoring of both the rules for determining scope on the logical form level and the rules for handling semantically vacuous elements.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">The system description in \citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 suggests relatively little tailoring at either level aside from adjustments to the Boxer lexicon to make more negation cues take the form of the negation operator in the DRS, the notion of scope is directly that given in the DRS.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Similarly, their heuristic for picking up semantically vacuous words is string-based and straightforward.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">The Crawler alone is less robust than the Boxer-based system, returning no output for 29% of the cues in CDE.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">These factors all point to higher precision and lower recall for the Crawler compared to the Boxer-based system.</a>
<a href="#13" id="13">At the token level, that is what we see.</a>
<a href="#14" id="14">Since full-scope recall depends on token-level precision, the Crawler does better across the board at the full-scope level.</a>
