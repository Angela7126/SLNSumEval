<a href="#0" id="0">Based on the assumption that these linguistic changes follow certain rules, we propose a method for automatically detecting pairs of cognates employing an orthographic alignment method which proved relevant for sequence alignment in computational biology.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms in order to infer rules for linguistic changes undergone by words when entering new languages and to discriminate between cognates and non-cognates.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Cognates are words in different languages having the same etymology and a common ancestor.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we propose a method for automatically determining pairs of cognates across languages.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In Section 3 we introduce our approach for detection of cognates using orthographic alignment.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">2013 ) proposed a method for cognate production relying on statistical character-based machine translation, learning orthographic production patterns, and Mulloni ( 2007 ) introduced an algorithm for cognate production based on edit distance alignment and the identification of orthographic cues when words enter a new language.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">We apply our method on an automatically extracted dataset of cognates for four pairs of languages.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We discard pairs of words for which the forms across languages are identical (i.e.,, the Romanian word matrice and its Italian cognate pair matrice , having the same form), because these pairs do not provide any orthographic changes to be learned.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">For each pair of languages we determine a number of non-cognate pairs equal to the number of cognate pairs.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Finally, we obtain 445 pairs of cognates for Romanian-French 2 2 The number of pairs of cognates is much lower for French than for the other languages because there are numerous Romanian words which have French etymology and, in this paper, we do not consider these words to be cognate candidates.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">Because we need sets of approximately equal size for comparison across languages, we keep 400 pairs of cognates and 400 pairs of non-cognates for each pair of languages.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">We propose a method for automatic detection of cognate pairs using orthographic alignment.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">We investigate the performance of the method we propose in comparison to previous approaches for automatic detection of cognate pairs based on orthographic similarity.</a>
