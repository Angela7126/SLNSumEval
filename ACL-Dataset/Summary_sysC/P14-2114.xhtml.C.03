<a href="#0" id="0">Approaches to event extraction from Twitter make use of a graphical model to extract canonical entertainment events from tweets by aggregating information across multiple messages [ 1 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We thus propose a Latent Event Model (LEM) which can automatically detect events from social media without the use of labeled data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We have also used a named entity tagger trained specifically on the Twitter data 3 3 http://github.com/aritter/twitter-nlp [ 13 ] to directly extract named entities from tweets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">After the pre-processing step, non-location entities y , locations l , dates d and candidate keywords of the tweets are collected as the input to the LEM model for event extraction.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">It should be noted here that some event elements such as location is not always available in the tweets.</a>
