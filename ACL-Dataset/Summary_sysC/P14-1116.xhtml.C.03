<a href="#0" id="0">Our proposed methodology treats content selection as a multi-label (ML) classification problem, which takes as input time-series data and outputs a set of templates, while capturing the dependencies between selected templates.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Content selection decisions based on trends in time-series data determine the selection of the useful and important variables, which we refer to here as factors , that should be conveyed in a summary.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We frame content selection as a simple classification task given a set of time-series data, decide for each template whether it should be included in a summary or not.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Collective content selection [] is similar to our proposed method in that it is a classification task that predicts the templates from the same instance simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In contrast, ML classification does not need the computation of links between the data and the templates.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">ML classification algorithms have been divided into three categories algorithm adaptation methods, problem transformation and ensemble methods [].</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Algorithm adaptation approaches [] extend simple classification methods to handle ML data.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Problem transformation approaches [] transform the ML classification task into one or more simple classification tasks.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Ensemble methods [] are algorithms that use ensembles to perform ML learning and they are based on problem transformation or algorithm adaptation methods.</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">The RAndom k-labELsets (RAkEL) [] was applied in order to perform ML classification.</a>
<a href="#10" id="10">The summaries generated by the ML classification system are then compared with the output of a RL system and two baseline systems in simulation and with real students.</a>
<a href="#11" id="11">For instance, classifier n was trained using the data from the 9 factors and the template decisions for templates 0 to n - 1.</a>
<a href="#12" id="12">The RL system differs from the classification system in the way it performs content selection.</a>
