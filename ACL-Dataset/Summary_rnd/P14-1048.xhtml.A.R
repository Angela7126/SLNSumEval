<a href="#1" id="1">We show that this post-editing can further improve the overall parsing performance.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While our bottom-up tree-building shares the greedy framework with HILDA, unlike HILDA, our local models are implemented using CRFs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Non-binary relations are converted into a cascade of right-branching binary relations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore, the total time complexity is (n-1)×O⁢(1)+(n-1)×O⁢(1)=O⁢(n) , where the first term in the summation is the complexity of computing all chains on the bottom level, and the second term is the complexity of computing the constant number of chains on higher levels.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The linear-chain CRF contains a first layer of all discourse constituents Uj ’s in the sentence on level i , and a second layer of relation nodes Rj ’s to represent the relation between a pair of discourse constituents.</a>
