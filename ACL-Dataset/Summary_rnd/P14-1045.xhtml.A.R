<a href="#4" id="4">The random forest model is significantly improved by the balancing techniques: the overall best F-score of 46.3% is reached with Random Forests and the cost-aware learning method.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">MetaCost is an interesting meta-learner that can use any classifier as a base classifier.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Thus there is no need for a syntactic analysis of the context considered when exploiting the resource, and sparsity is less of an issue .</a>
