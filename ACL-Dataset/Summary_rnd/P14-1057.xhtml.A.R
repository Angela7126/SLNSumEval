<a href="#0" id="0">Finally, we report the performance improvement of the proposed methods over the Concept-BL for each query in Figure 3 .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, to address the limitation caused by the inaccurate concept mapping results, we propose to regularize the weighting strategies in the concept-based representation methods.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Unified Constraint: Let query be Q={e1,e2,e3} , and we know that e2 is a variant of e3 .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Balanced Constraint: Let Q be a query with two concepts and the concepts are associated with different aspects, i.e., Q={e1,e2} , and ùíú‚Å¢(e1)‚â†ùíú‚Å¢(e2) .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Each of them is mapped to multiple concepts, and each concept is associated with the confidence score as well as more detailed information about this concept.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since documents are often much longer, we can first segment them into sentences, get the mapping results for each sentence, and then merge them together to generate the concept-based representation for the documents.</a>
