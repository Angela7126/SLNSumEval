<a href="#0" id="0">Our development set is NIST 2005 MT evaluation set (1084 sentences), and our test set is NIST 2006 MT evaluation set (1664 sentences).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Figure 5 shows there is little change in the performance of using single DAE to learn different dimensional DAE features, but the 4-dimensional features work more better and more stable.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Deep models such as DNN have the potential to be much more representationally efficient for feature learning than shallow models like GMM.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Similarly, a nt⁢h RBM is built on the output of the n-1t⁢h one and so on until a sufficiently deep architecture is created.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This model employ phrase pair similarity to encode the weights of content and non-content words in phrase translation pairs.</a>
