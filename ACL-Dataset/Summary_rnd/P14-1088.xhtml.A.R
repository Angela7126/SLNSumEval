<a href="#2" id="2">This is due to the fact that α requires O⁢(n2) comparisons to be made, each of which is O⁢(n2) using our current approach.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Krippendorff’s α is normally expressed in terms of the ratio of observed and expected disagreements: α=1-Do/De , where Do is the mean squared distance between annotations of the same item and De the mean squared distance between all pairs of annotations:</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the case of dependency-based syntax we could conceivably use a variant of these metrics by considering the ID of a token’s head as a categorical variable (the approach taken in [] ), but we argue that this is not satisfactory.</a>
