<a href="#1" id="1">One of the main disadvantages of noise tolerance techniques is that they are learning algorithm-dependent.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We partition T into k subsets, and each time we keep a different subset as testing data and train a classifier using the other k-1 subsets of data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, we applied the under-sampling strategy when training the classifiers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Since we focus on n-gram features, we use the words feature and term interchangeably in this paper.</a>
