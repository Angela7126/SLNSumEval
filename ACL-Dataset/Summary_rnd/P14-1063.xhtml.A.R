<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we shift the model from vector-space to tensor-space.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The best results are consistently given by 2nd order tensor models, and the differences between the 3rd and 4th order tensors are not significant.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We used the Charniak parser [Charniak et al.2005] for our experiment, and we used the proposed algorithm to train the reranking feature weights.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given D and V , there are many possible combinations of nd,d=1,…,D , and the optimal combination should indeed be determined by the structure of target features weights.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Then the total number of parameters to be learned for this tensor model is H⁢∑d=1Dnd , which is usually much smaller than V=∏d=1Dnd for a traditional vector space model.</a>
