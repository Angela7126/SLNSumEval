<a href="#0" id="0">Though Khan et al.’s study was limited to this one kind of structural ambiguity, they do observe that generating the brief variants when the intended interpretation is clear instantiates Van Deemter’s [33] general strategy of only avoiding vicious ambiguities —that is, ambiguities where the intended interpretation fails to be considerably more likely than any other distractor interpretations—rather than trying to avoid all ambiguities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Generally, inserting a complementizer makes the onset of a complement clause more predictable, and thus less information dense, thereby avoiding a potential spike in information density that is associated with comprehension difficulty.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">Additionally, via a targeted manual analysis, we showed that the SVM reranker frequently manages to avoid egregious errors involving “vicious” ambiguities, of the kind that would mislead human readers as to the intended meaning.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We trained the SVM ranker [17] with a linear kernel and chose the hyper-parameter c , which tunes the trade-off between training error and margin, with 6-fold cross-validation on the devset.</a>
