<a href="#0" id="0">The constraints learned by Hayes and Wilson’s learner are essentially OT markedness constraints, but their learner does not have to account for varied inputs or effects of faithfulness constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For instance, the strongest learned markedness constraint, shown as M1 in Figure 2 , has the same violations as the top-ranked constraint that actively distinguishes between candidates in each paradigm.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In MaxEnt OT, each constraint has a weight, and the candidates’ scores are the sums of the weights of violated constraints.</a>
