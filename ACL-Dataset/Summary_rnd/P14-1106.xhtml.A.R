<a href="#0" id="0">First, the syntactic reordering model can be extended to model reordering among constituents that cross CFG rules.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To validate this conjecture on our translation test data, we compare the reordering performance among the MR08 system, the improved systems and the maximum entropy classifiers.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The syntactic reordering model takes a CFG rule (e.g., VP→VP⁢PP⁢PP ) and models the reordering of the constituents on the left hand side by examining their translation or visit order according to the target language.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since the syntactic parses of the tuning and test data contain 29 types of constituent labels and 35 types of POS tags, we have 29 types of XP + features and 64 types of XP = features.</a>
