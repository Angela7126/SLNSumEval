<a href="#0" id="0">Toward this objective we make the following contributions: (a) devise a time-varying graph clustering based sense induction algorithm, (b) use the time-varying sense clusters to develop a split-join based approach for identifying new senses of a word, and (c) evaluate the performance of the algorithms on various datasets using different suitable approaches along with a detailed error analysis.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Next we calculate the lexicographer’s mutual information LMI [Kilgarriff2004] between a word and its features and retain only the top 1000 ranked features for every word.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On one hand, our method can be used by lexicographers in designing new dictionaries where candidate new senses can be semi-automatically detected and included, thus greatly reducing the otherwise required manual effort.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The time periods were set such that the amount of data in each time period is roughly the same.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The evaluation settings were as follows:</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Then, if sn⁢e⁢w∉Si⁢n⁢i⁢t , it implies that this is a new sense that was not present in the source clusters and we call it a ‘success’ as per WordNet.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Further, systematic evaluation of the results obtained by the authors has not been provided.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">If a word undergoes a sense change, this can be detected by comparing its senses obtained from two different time periods.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">Making comparisons between all the pairs of time periods gave us 28 candidate words lists.</a>
