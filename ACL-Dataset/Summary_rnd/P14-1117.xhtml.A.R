<a href="#0" id="0">Convergence rates also vary for these two techniques: DP+LP has a lower rate of empirical convergence (15% on BN and 4% on NW) when compared to DP+LP→MST (19% on BN and 6% on NW).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We followed Martins et al. (2009) in using LP-relaxed inference during learning, assuming algorithmic separability [28] for these problems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">When 𝜶⁢(𝐲(i))=𝜷⁢(𝐳(i)) , the resulting primal solution is exact, i.e., 𝐲(i) and 𝐳(i) represent the optimal structures under ( 2 ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, it is well-established that the utility of ILP for optimal inference in structured problems is often outweighed by the worst-case performance of ILP solvers on large problems without unique integral solutions.</a>
