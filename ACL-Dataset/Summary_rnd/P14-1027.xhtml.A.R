<a href="#1" id="1">At every 10th sweep of the last 1,000 sweeps we use the model to segment the entire corpus (even if it is only trained on a subset of it), so we collect 800 sample segmentations of each utterance.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">There are several different procedures for inferring the parse trees and the rule probabilities given a corpus of strings: describe a MCMC sampler and describe a Variational Bayes procedure.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This paper showed that the word segmentation accuracy of a state-of-the-art Adaptor Grammar model is significantly improved by extending it so that it explicitly models some properties of function words.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">SIL/I”</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In an Adaptor Grammar the frequency distribution of function words might be modelled by specifying the prior for the Pitman-Yor Process parameters associated with the function words’ adapted nonterminals so that it prefers to generate a small number of high-frequency items.</a>
