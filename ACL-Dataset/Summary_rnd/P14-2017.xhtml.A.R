<a href="#1" id="1">Words undergo various changes when entering new languages.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For SVM, we use the wrapper provided by Weka for LibSVM [5] .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper we used a very simple substitution matrix for the alignment algorithm, but the method can be adapted to integrate historical information regarding language evolution.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Algorithms for string alignment were successfully used for identifying cognates based on both their forms, orthographic and phonetic.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, because the edit distance was widely used in this research area and produced good results, we are encouraged to employ orthographic alignment for identifying pairs of cognates, not only to compute similarity scores, as was previously done, but to use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms.</a>
