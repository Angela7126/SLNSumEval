<a href="#1" id="1">â€¢ parsing : (i) MWE analysis with classification of MWEs into regular or irregular, (ii) merge of predicted irregular MWEs, (iii) tagging and morphological prediction, (iv) parsing JOINT-IRREG architecture:</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Concerning the three distinct representations, evaluating on structured representation (hence without looking at regular MWE status) leads to a rough 2 point performance increase for the LAS and a one point increase for the UAS, with respect to the evaluation against flat representation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">While this non-realistic scenario has been shown to help parsing [18, 15] ,That intuition is confirmed in a classical but non-realistic setting in which gold MWEs are pre-grouped [2, 18, 15] .</a>
