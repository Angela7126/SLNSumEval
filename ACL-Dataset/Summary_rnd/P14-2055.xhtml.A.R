<a href="#0" id="0">In some cases, surprise can be computed analytically, in particular when the prior distribution is conjugate to the form of the hypothesis, and so the posterior has the same functional form as the prior.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Here a userâ€™s prior knowledge is approximated by a background corpus and we show how to identify sentences from the input set which are most surprising with respect to this background.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Step 3: Sentence selection.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">So new words in an input are added to the background corpus with a count of 1 and the counts of existing words in the background are incremented by 1 before computing the prior parameters.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Rather our goal in this work is to demonstrate a simple and intuitive unsupervised model.</a>
