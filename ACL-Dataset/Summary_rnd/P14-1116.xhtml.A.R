<a href="#1" id="1">The comparison shows that each method can serve different goals.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We consider the task of automatically generating feedback summaries for students describing their performance during the lab of a Computer Science module over the semester.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">The Temporal Difference learning method was used to train an agent for content selection.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Multi-label classification is the task of associating an observation with a set of labels YâŠ†L [] .</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The LP method transforms the ML task, into one single-label multi-class classification task, where the possible set of predicted variables for the transformed class is the powerset of labels present in the original dataset.</a>

<a href="#8" id="8">7 Summary</a>
<a href="#9" id="9">Our contributions to the field are as follows: we present a novel and efficient method for tackling the challenge of content selection using a ML classification approach; we applied this method to the domain of feedback summarisation; we present a comparison with an optimisation technique (Reinforcement Learning), and we discuss the similarities and differences between the two methods.</a>
