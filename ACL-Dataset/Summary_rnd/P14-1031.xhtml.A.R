<a href="#0" id="0">For example, the proportion of negative sentences in the positive documents is very small compared to the proportion of positive sentences.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In general, it is hard to learn reliable indicators for the neutral sentiment.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Somasundaran et al. (2008) define opinion target relations and apply them to constrain the polarity of text segments annotated with target relations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">During inference, we find the best label assignment by computing argmax𝐲q(𝐲|𝐱) .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Therefore we allow the lexical patterns to be assigned a neutral sentiment with a prior probability r0 (we compute this value as the empirical probability of neutral sentiment in the training documents).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Specifically, we construct the lexical constraints by extracting sentiment-bearing patterns within sentences and construct the discourse-level constraints by extracting discourse relations that indicate sentiment coherence or sentiment changes both within and across sentences.</a>
