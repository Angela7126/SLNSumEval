<a href="#0" id="0">The first constituent conveys positive sentiment with never lethargic and the second conveys negative sentiment with hindered , but to determine the overall sentiment of the sentence, we need to exploit the fact that while signals a discounting of the information that follows it.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For this experiment and all others, we include a basic set of lexicon features, i.e. features on preterminal part-of-speech tags.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The underlying reason that such propagation is even needed is that PCFG parsers score trees based on local configurations only, and any information that is not threaded through the tree becomes inaccessible to the scoring function.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In Table 4 , we see that our performance is overall substantially higher than that of the Berkeley parser.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">There are a great number of spans in a typical treebank; extracting features for every possible combination of span and rule is prohibitive.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Less Grammar, More Features.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Finally, our high performance on languages such as Polish and Swedish, whose training treebanks consist of 6578 and 5000 sentences, respectively, show that our feature-rich model performs robustly even on treebanks much smaller than the Penn Treebank.</a>
