<a href="#1" id="1">We compared recent models for this task both on a benchmark object recognition dataset and on a more realistic and noisier dataset covering a wide range of concepts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This line of research tackles the grounding problem: Word representations are no longer limited to their linguistic contexts but also encode visual information present in images associated with the corresponding objects.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is inspired by analogous qualitative analysis conducted in Topic Models [20] , where “topics” are interpreted in terms of the words with the highest probability under each of them.</a>

<a href="#5" id="5">Although the agent is equipped with a powerful context vector model, this will not suffice to successfully complete the task.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">For tuning the number of hidden units of NN , we use the MEN-concrete dataset of Bruni et al. (2014) .</a>
