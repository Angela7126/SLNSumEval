<a href="#0" id="0">This allows Rampion to improve F1 over the baseline.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Lastly, regularization can be introduced by using update rules corresponding to primal form optimization variants of support vector machines [Collobert and Bengio2004, Chapelle2007, Shalev-Shwartz et al.2007] .</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Here, learning proceeds by “trying out” translation hypotheses, receiving a response from interacting in the task, and converting this response into a supervision signal for updating model parameters.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Computation of distance to the reference translation usually involves cost functions based on sentence-level BLEU ( Nakov et al.2012 , inter alia ) and incorporates the current model score, leading to various ramp loss objectives described in Gimpel and Smith2012 .</a>
