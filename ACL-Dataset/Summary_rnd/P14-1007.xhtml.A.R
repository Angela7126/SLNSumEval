<a href="#1" id="1">Crawler N , which falls back just for parse failure brings the recall back up, and results in F 1 levels closer to the system of Rea:Vel:Ovr:12, albeit still not quite advancing the state of the art (except over the development set).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, our approach scores high on transparency, adaptability, and replicability.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The ranking approach showed a modest advantage over the heuristics (with F 1 equal to 77.9 and 76.7, respectively, when resolving the scope of gold-standard cues in evaluation data).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This leads us to _no_q as our entry point into the graph.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Because our crawling algorithm so closely models the guidelines, this puts our system in an interesting position to provide feedback to the Shared Task organizers.</a>
