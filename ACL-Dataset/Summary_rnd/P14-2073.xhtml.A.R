<a href="#1" id="1">In the experiments of Börschinger and Johnson (2012), the particle cloud appears to be resampled once per utterance with a large rejuvenation sequence; each particle takes many more rejuvenation MCMC steps than new state transitions and thus resembles a batch MCMC sampler.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Choosing a long sequence (large |ℛ⁢(i)|) may result in a more accurate posterior approximation but also increases runtime and storage requirements.</a>
