<a href="#0" id="0">Our data consists of 15.1 billion words of text data from Google Maps TM , lower-cased and tokenized to remove punctuation symbols.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We can see that the SVM model has very high precision for its highest ranked examples, yielding nearly 20% of the correct expansions without any incorrect expansions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In our experiments, k=2 since we have a trigram model, though in cases where the target word is the last word in the string, k=1 , because there only the end-of-string symbol must be predicted in addition to the expansion.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Perhaps the most demanding such application is text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) since, while for parsing, machine translation and information retrieval it may be acceptable to leave such things as numbers and abbreviations unexpanded, for TTS all tokens need to be read , and for that it is necessary to know how to pronounce them.</a>
