<a href="#0" id="0">Seeking alternatives to measuring syntactic complexity of spoken responses via syntactic parsers, we study a shallow-analysis based approach for use in automatic scoring.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is beneficial in situations where the features are not evenly important across all score levels.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Unlike previous studies, it did not rely on the occurrence of normative grammatical constructions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Shallow Analysis Based Assessment of Syntactic Complexity for Automated Speech Scoring.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Here we outline the multiple stages involved in the automatic syntactic complexity assessment.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">One straightforward way of using the maximum entropy classifier’s prediction for our case is to directly use its predicted score-level – 1, 2, 3 or 4.</a>
