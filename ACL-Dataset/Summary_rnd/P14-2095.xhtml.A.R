<a href="#1" id="1">5 Conclusions</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The annotation projection baseline implementation is straightforward.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This task consists in identifying predicates and their arguments in sentences and assigning each argument a semantic role with respect to its predicate (see figure 1 ).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Alternative Sources of Information</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Note that predicate and argument identification in both languages is performed using monolingual classifiers and only aligned pairs are used in projection.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Instead of designing this representation manually, however, we create compact monolingual feature representations for source and target languages separately and automatically estimate the mapping between the two from parallel data.</a>
