<a href="#0" id="0">Our main contributions include:</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Querying for more neighbors per user is more beneficial than querying for extra content from the existing neighbors e.g., 5 tweets from 10 neighbors leads to higher accuracy than 25 tweets from 2 neighbors or 50 tweets from 1 neighbor.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">These results are coherent with the outcomes for our static models shown in Figures 4 and 5 .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We design a set of experiments to analyze static and dynamic models for political affiliation classification defined in Sections 3 and 4 .</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We average the posterior probability results over the users in Gc⁢a⁢n⁢d , Gg⁢e⁢o and GZ⁢L⁢R graphs.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We estimate dynamic posterior updates from a joint stream of user and neighbor communications in Gg⁢e⁢o , Gc⁢a⁢n⁢d and GZ⁢L⁢R graphs.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">1.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We first answer whether communications from user-local neighborhoods can help predict political preference for the user.</a>
