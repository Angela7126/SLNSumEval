<a href="#1" id="1">We can hypothesise that in both translation and summarisation, the source text acts as a lexical and semantic framework within which the translation or summarisation process takes place.</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper we estimate the correlation of human judgements with five automatic evaluation measures on two image description data sets.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To classify the strength of the correlations, we followed the guidance of Dancey and Reidy (2011) , who posit that a co-efficient of 0.0–0.1 is uncorrelated, 0.11–0.4 is weak , 0.41–0.7 is moderate , 0.71–0.90 is strong , and 0.91–1.0 is perfect .</a>
