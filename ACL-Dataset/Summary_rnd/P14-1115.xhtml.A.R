<a href="#0" id="0">In order to select and extract the informative summary-worthy utterances, based on the phrasal query and the original text, we consider two criteria: i) utterances should carry the essence of the original text; and ii) utterances should be relevant to the query.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this case the lexical choice for the node is selected based on the tf.idf score of each node; iii) They are from a hypernym/hyponym pair or share a common direct hypernym.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We extract all concepts that are synonyms to the query terms and add them to the original set of query terms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This means our systems can effectively aggregate the extracted sentences and generate abstract sentences based on the query content.</a>
