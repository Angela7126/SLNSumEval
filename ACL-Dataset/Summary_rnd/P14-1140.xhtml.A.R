<a href="#1" id="1">l,m,n are the indexes of the string.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The recursive auto-encoder is trained with reordering examples extracted from word-aligned bilingual sentences.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">From the forced decoding result, we can get the ideal derivation tree in the decoderâ€™s search space, and extract positive/oracle translation candidates.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We can see that, our R 2 NN models with WEPPE and TCBPPE are both better than the baseline system.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">And also, translation task is difference from other NLP tasks, that, it is more important to model the translation confidence directly (the confidence of one target phrase as a translation of the source phrase), and our TCBPPE is designed for such purpose.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The data is from the IWSLT 2009 dialog task.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We conduct experiments on a Chinese-to-English translation task to test our proposed methods, and we get about 1.5 BLEU points improvement, compared with a state-of-the-art baseline system.</a>
