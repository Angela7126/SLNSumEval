<a href="#0" id="0">The example below shows a difficult-to-segment proper name comprised of common characters, which results in undersegmentation by the character-based CRF and oversegmentation by the word-based perceptron, but our method achieves the correct middle ground.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Perhaps most importantly, our approach is straightforward to implement and does not require retraining of the underlying segmentation models used.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can then form the dual of this problem by taking the min outside of the max , which is an upper bound on the original problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These mixing models perform well on standard datasets, but are not in wide use because of their high computational costs and difficulty of implementation.</a>
