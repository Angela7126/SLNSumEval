<a href="#0" id="0">Dorow et al. (2009) and Laws et al. (2010) extend SimRank to edge weights, edge labels and multiple graphs.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To calculate PPR+cos, we computed 20 iterations with a decay factor of 0.8 and used the cosine similarity with the 2-norm in the denominator to compare two vectors.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">2 after k iterations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">CoSimRank should generally be three times faster than typed CoSimRank since the typed version has to repeat the computation for each of the three types.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">7 and 8 , we see that SimRank and CoSimRank are very similar except that they initialize the similarities on the diagonal differently.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We will re-add a damping factor later in the calculation.</a>
