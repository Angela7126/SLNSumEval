<a href="#0" id="0">Our method, on the other hand, uses no parsing, and only the synset definitions (and not the graph structure) of WordNet .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This can be due to, for example, words taking on new meanings over time (e.g. the relatively recent senses of tablet and swipe related to touchscreen computers) or domain-specific terms not being included in a more general-purpose sense inventory.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The system reads in a collection of usages of that lemma, and automatically induces topics (= senses) in the form of a multinomial distribution over words, and per-usage topic assignments (= probabilistic sense assignments) in the form of a multinomial distribution over topics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An additional advantage of this procedure is that it allows us to control an important property of novel senses: their frequency of occurrence.</a>
