<a href="#0" id="0">We then describe the dataset and dependent variable in this study, and the experiments are shown in Section 6 .</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Perform nonparametric Box kernel density estimates of the covariates and the dependent variable for smoothing.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We see that when features are rather noisy, we might need to investigate regularized copula models to avoid this.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The copula model outperformed all three baselines by a wide margin on this dataset with both metrics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By doing this, we are essentially performing probability integral transform â€” an important statistical technique that moves beyond the count-based bag-of-words feature space to marginal cumulative density functions space.</a>

<a href="#6" id="6">We are among the first to formally study transcripts of earnings calls to predict financial risks.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">By varying the size of the training data and the dimensionality of the covariates, we have demonstrated that our proposed model is relatively robust across different parameter settings.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this work, we apply the parametric Gaussian copula to model the correlations among the text features and the label.</a>
