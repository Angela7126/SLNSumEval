<a href="#0" id="0">We use precision, recall, and F-score as our metrics to evaluate the performances of the methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Using the word embeddings, we learn the hypernym–hyponym relationship by estimating projection matrices which map words to their hypernyms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our previous work [8] applies a web mining method to discover the hypernyms of Chinese entities from multiple sources.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Moreover, combining our method with the manually-built hierarchy extension method proposed by Suchanek et al. (2008) can further improve F-score to 80.29%.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We obtain 15,247 word pairs of hypernym–hyponym relations (9,288 for direct relations and 5,959 for indirect relations).</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Finally we obtain the embedding vectors of 0.56 million words.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This method mines hypernyms of a given word w from multiple sources and returns a ranked list of the hypernyms.</a>
