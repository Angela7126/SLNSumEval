<a href="#0" id="0">These models support efficient dynamic-programming inference, but only model local dependencies in the output label sequence.</a>

<a href="#2" id="2">This method drives many penalties to zero, which allows users to automatically discover discriminative constraints from large families of candidates.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, we pay a cost ci times the degree to which the i th constraint is violated, which mirrors how slack variables are used to represent the hinge loss for SVMs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, at every iteration of dual decomposition, MAP must be run in this auxiliary model.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Here, yd denotes the ground truth labeling and wd is the vector of scores for the CRF tagger.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Furthermore, since the dataset is so small, learning the penalties for our large collection of constraints is difficult, and test set results are unreliable.</a>
