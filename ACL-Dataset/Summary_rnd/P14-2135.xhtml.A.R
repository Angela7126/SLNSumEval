<a href="#0" id="0">We presented a novel method, image dispersion-based filtering, that improves multi-modal representations by approximating conceptual concreteness from images and filtering model input.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On a different set of 200 concepts extracted by random sampling from the USF dataset stratified by concreteness rating (including concepts across the concreteness spectrum), we observed a high correlation between abstractness and dispersion (Spearman œÅ=0.61,p<0.001 ).</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Following the motivation outlined in Section 1, we aim to distinguish visual input corresponding to concrete concepts from visual input corresponding to abstract concepts.</a>
