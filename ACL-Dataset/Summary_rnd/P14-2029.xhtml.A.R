<a href="#2" id="2">In each instance, we use the logarithm of one plus the frequency.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given a sentence with with n word tokens, the model filters out tokens containing nonalphabetic characters and then computes the number of misspelled words nm⁢i⁢s⁢s (later referred to as num_misspelled ), the proportion of misspelled words nm⁢i⁢s⁢sn , and log⁡(nm⁢i⁢s⁢s+1) as features.</a>
