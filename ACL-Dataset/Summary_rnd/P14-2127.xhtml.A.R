<a href="#2" id="2">We have presented a latent-variable violation-fixing framework for general structured prediction problems with inexact search over hypergraphs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The general idea is to update somewhere in the middle of the search (where search error happens) rather than at the very end (standard update is often invalid).</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We now describe how to find the gold derivations.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In the first, -⁢LM phase, the decoder parses the source sentence using the source projection of the synchronous grammar (see Fig. 2 (a) for an example), producing a -⁢LM hypergraph where each node has a signature N[i:j] , where N is the nonterminal type (either X or S in Hiero ) and [i:j] is the span, and each hyperedge e is an application of the translation rule r⁢(e) (see Figure 3 ).</a>
