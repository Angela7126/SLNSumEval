<a href="#1" id="1">For each citation token we then extract its context (b.i), which becomes the query in IR terms.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Also, given that recommending the original citation used by the author in first position is our key criterion, a metric with smooth discounting like NDCG is too lenient for our purposes.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">However, it is immediately clear that purely external methods obtain higher scores than internal ones.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We intend to investigate more sophisticated ways of document representation and of extracting a citation’s context.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">This metric is intuitive in measuring the efficiency of the system at this task, as it is immediately interpretable as a percentage of success.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The set of experiments we present here apply this evaluation to test a number of IR techniques which we detail in the next section.</a>
