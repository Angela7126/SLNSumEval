<a href="#1" id="1">This set of corpus-based features is a reimplementation of the linguistic indicators of Siegel and McKeown (2000) , who show that (some of) these features correlate with either stative or dynamic verb types.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">More accurate temporal information processing is expected to be beneficial for a variety of natural language processing tasks [7, 32] .</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Experiment 4: Instance-based classification</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We observe higher agreement in the jokes and news subcorpora than for letters; texts in the letters subcorpora are largely argumentative and thus have a different rhetorical style than the more straightforward narratives and reports found in jokes.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Overall, we find substantial agreement.</a>
