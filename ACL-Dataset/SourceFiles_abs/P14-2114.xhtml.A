       Introduction

        Event extraction is to automatically identify events from text with information about
        what
        happened,
        when
        ,
        where
        , to
        whom
        , and
        why
        . Previous work in event extraction has focused largely on news articles, as the newswire texts have been the best source of information on current events
        [6]
        . Approaches for event extraction include knowledge-based
        [12, 15]
        , data-driven
        [11]
        and a combination of the above two categories
        [5]
        . Knowledge-based approaches often rely on linguistic and lexicographic patterns which represent expert domain knowledge for particular event types. They lack the flexibility of porting to new domains since extraction patterns often need to be re-defined. Data-driven approaches require large annotated data to train statistical models that approximate linguistic phenomena. Nevertheless, it is expensive to obtain annotated data in practice.

        With the increasing popularity of social media, social networking sites such as Twitter have become an important source of event information. As reported in
        [10]
        , even 1% of the public stream of Twitter contains around 95% of all the events reported in the newswire. Nevertheless, the social stream data such as Twitter data pose new challenges. Social media messages are often short and evolve rapidly over time. As such, it is not possible to know the event types a priori and hence violates the use of existing event extraction approaches.

        Approaches to event extraction from Twitter make use of a graphical model to extract canonical entertainment events from tweets by aggregating information across multiple messages
        [1]
        . In
        [7]
        , social events involving two persons are extracted from multiple similar tweets using a factor graph by harvesting the redundancy in tweets. Ritter et al.
        [14]
        presented a system called TwiCal which extracts an open-domain calendar of significant events represented by a 4-tuple set including a named entity, event phrase, calendar date, and event type from Twitter.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        In our work here, we notice a very important property in social media data that the same event could be referenced by high volume messages. This property allows us resort to statistical models that can group similar events based on the co-occurrence patterns of their event elements. Here, event elements include named entities such as person, company, organization, date/time, location, and the relations among them. We can treat an event as a latent variable and model the generation of an event as a joint distribution of its individual event elements. We thus propose a Latent Event Model (LEM) which can automatically detect events from social media without the use of labeled data.

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p5">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Our work is similar to TwiCal in the sense that we also focus on the extraction of structured representation of events from Twitter. However, TwiCal relies on a supervised sequence labeler trained on tweets annotated with event mentions for the identification of event-related phrases. We propose a simple Bayesian modelling approach which is able to directly extract event-related keywords from tweets without supervised learning. Also, TwiCal uses
        G2
        test to choose an entity
        y
        with the strongest association with a date
        d
        to form a binary tuple
        ⟨y,d⟩
        to represent an event. On the contrary, the structured representation of events can be directly extracted from the output of our LEM model. We have conducted experiments on a Twitter corpus and the results show that our proposed approach outperforms TwiCal, the state-of-the-art open event extraction system, by 7.7% in F-measure.

       Methodology
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Events extracted in our proposed framework are represented as a 4-tuple
        ⟨y,d,l,k⟩
        , where
        y
        stands for a non-location named entity,
        d
        for a date,
        l
        for a location, and
        k
        for an event-related keyword. Each event mentioned in tweets can be closely depicted by this representation. It should be noted that for some events, one or more elements in their corresponding tuples might be absent as their related information is not available in tweets. As illustrated in Figure
        1
        , our proposed framework consists of three main steps, pre-processing, event extraction based on the LEM model and post-processing. The details of our proposed framework are described below.

          Twitter users might represent the same date in various forms. For example, “tomorrow”, “next Monday”, “ August 23th” in tweets might all refer to the same day, depending on the date that users wrote the tweets. To resolve the ambiguity of the time expressions, SUTime
          [2]
          is employed, which takes text and a reference date as input and outputs a more accurate date which the time expression refers to.

          Named entity recognition (NER) is a crucial step since the results would directly impact the final extracted 4-tuple
          ⟨y,d,l,k⟩
          . It is not easy to accurately identify named entities in the Twitter data since tweets contain a lot of misspellings and abbreviations. However, it is often observed that events mentioned in tweets are also reported in news articles in the same period
          [10]
          . Therefore, named entities mentioned in tweets are likely to appear in news articles as well. We thus perform named entity recognition in the following way. First, a traditional NER tool such as the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer
          is used to identify named entities from the news articles crawled from BBC and CNN during the same period that the tweets were published. The recognised named entities from news are then used to build a dictionary. Named entities from tweets are extracted by looking up the dictionary through fuzzy matching. We have also used a named entity tagger trained specifically on the Twitter data
          [13]
          to directly extract named entities from tweets. However, as will be shown in Section
          3
          that using our constructed dictionary for named entity extraction gives better results. We distinguish between location entities, denoted as
          l
          , and non-location entities such as person or organization, denoted as
          y
          .

          Finally, we use a POS tagger
          trained on tweets
          [3]
          to perform POS tagging on the tweets data and apart from the previously recognised named entities, only words tagged with nouns, verbs or adjectives are kept. These remaining words are subsequently stemmed and words occurred less than 3 times are filtered.

        Event Extraction using the Latent Event Model (LEM)

location and have similar keyword to be assigned with the same event.

         We use the First Story Detection (FSD) dataset
         [10]
         in our experiment. It consists of 2,499 tweets which are manually annotated with the corresponding event instances resulting in a total of 27 events. The tweets were published between 7th July and 12th September 2011. These events cover a range of categories, from celebrity news to accidents, and from natural disasters to science discoveries. It should be noted here that some event elements such as location is not always available in the tweets. Automatically inferring geolocation of the tweets is a challenging task and will be considered in our future work. For the tweets without time expressions, we used the tweets’ publication dates as a default.
The number of tweets for each event ranges from 2 to around 1000. We believe that in reality, events which are mentioned in very few tweets are less likely to be significant. Therefore, the dataset was filtered by removing the events which are mentioned in less than 10 tweets. This results in a final dataset containing 2468 tweets annotated with 21 events.

        Baseline construction
       </h3>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS2.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         The baseline we chose is TwiCal
         [14]
         . The events extracted in the baseline are represented as a 3-tuple
         ⟨y,d,k⟩
         , where
         y
         stands for a non-location named entity,
         d
         for a date and
         k
         for an event phrase. We re-implemented the system and evaluate the performance of the baseline on the correctness of the exacted three elements excluding the location element.
In the baseline approach, the tuple
         ⟨y,d,k⟩
         are extracted in the following ways.
Firstly, a named entity recognizer
         [13]
         is employed to identify named entities. The TempEx
         [9]
         is used to resolve temporal expressions. For each date, the baseline approach chose the entity
         y
         with the strongest association with the date and form the binary tuple
         ⟨y,d⟩
         to represent an event. An event phrase extractor trained on annotated tweets is required to extract event-related phrases. Due to the difficulties of re-implementing the sequence labeler without knowing the actual features set and the annotated training data, we assume all the event-related phrases are identified correctly and simply use the event trigger words annotated in the FSD corpus as
         k
         to form the event 3-tuples. It is worth noting that the F-measure reported for the event phrase extraction is only 64% in the baseline approach

       Conclusions and Future Work
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        In this paper we have proposed an unsupervised Bayesian model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract the structured representation of events from social media data. Instead of employing labeled corpora for training, the proposed model only requires the identification of named entities, locations and time expressions. After that, the model can automatically extract events which involving a named entity at certain time, location, and with event-related keywords based on the co-occurrence patterns of the event elements. Our proposed model has been evaluated on
the FSD corpus. Experimental results show our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by over 7% in F-measure. In future work, we plan to investigate inferring geolocations automatically from tweets. We also intend to study a better method to infer date more accurately from tweets and explore efficient ranking strategies to rank evens extracted for a better presentation of results.
