        Statistical approaches to machine translation (SMT) use sentence-aligned, parallel corpora to learn translation rules along with their probabilities.
With large amounts of data, phrase-based translation systems
        [14, 5]
        achieve state-of-the-art results in many typologically diverse language pairs
        [2]
        .
However, the limiting factor in the success of these techniques is parallel data availability.
Even in resource-rich languages, learning reliable translations of multiword phrases is a challenge, and an adequate phrasal inventory is crucial for effective translation.
This problem is exacerbated in the many language pairs for which parallel resources are either limited or nonexistent.
While parallel data is generally scarce, monolingual resources exist in abundance and are being created at accelerating rates.
Can we use monolingual data to augment the phrasal translations acquired from parallel data?
       </p>

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        The challenge of learning translations from monolingual data is of long standing interest, and has been approached in several ways
        [20, 3, 9, 21]
        .
Our work introduces a new take on the problem using graph-based semi-supervised learning to acquire translation rules and probabilities by leveraging both monolingual and parallel data resources.
On the source side, labeled phrases (those with known translations) are extracted from bilingual corpora, and unlabeled phrases are extracted from monolingual corpora; together they are embedded as nodes in a graph, with the monolingual data determining edge strengths between nodes (§
        2.2
        ).
Unlike previous work
        [11, 22]
        , we use higher order
        n
        -grams instead of restricting to unigrams, since our approach goes beyond OOV mitigation and can enrich the entire translation model by using evidence from monolingual text.
This enhancement alone results in an improvement of almost 1.4 BLEU points.
On the target side, phrases initially consisting of translations from the parallel data are selectively expanded with generated candidates (§
        2.1
        ), and are embedded in a target graph.

      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        We then limit the set of translation options for each unlabeled source phrase (§
        2.3
        ), and using a structured graph propagation algorithm, where translation information is propagated from labeled to unlabeled phrases proportional to
        both
        source and target phrase similarities, we estimate probability distributions over translations for the unlabeled source phrases (§
        2.4
        ).
The additional phrases are incorporated in the SMT system through a secondary phrase table (§
        2.5
        ).
We evaluated the proposed approach on both Arabic-English and Urdu-English under a range of scenarios (§
        3
        ), varying the amount and type of monolingual corpora used, and obtained improvements between 1 and 4 BLEU points, even when using very large language models.

       Generation &amp; Propagation

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Our goal is to obtain translation distributions for source phrases that are not present in the phrase table extracted from the parallel corpus.
Both parallel and monolingual corpora are used to obtain these probability distributions over target phrases.
We assume that sufficient parallel resources exist to learn a basic translation model using standard techniques, and also assume the availability of larger monolingual corpora in both the source and target languages.
Although our technique applies to phrases of any length, in this work we concentrate on unigram and bigram phrases, which provides substantial computational cost savings.

        Monolingual data is used to construct
        separate
        similarity graphs over phrases (word sequences), as illustrated in Fig.
        1
        .
The source similarity graph consists of phrase nodes representing sequences of words in the source language.
If a source phrase is found in the baseline phrase table it is called a
        labeled
        phrase: its conditional empirical probability distribution over target phrases (estimated from the parallel data) is used as the label, and is subsequently never changed.
Otherwise it is called an
        unlabeled
        phrase, and our algorithm finds labels (translations) for these unlabeled phrases, with the help of the graph-based representation.
The label space is thus the phrasal translation inventory, and like the source side it can also be represented in terms of a graph, initially consisting of target phrase nodes from the parallel corpus.

      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p3">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        For the unlabeled phrases, the set of possible target translations could be extremely large (e.g., all target language
        n
        -grams).
Therefore, we first
        generate
        and fix a list of possible target translations for each unlabeled source phrase.
We then
        propagate
        by deriving a probability distribution over these target phrases using graph propagation techniques.
Next, we will describe the generation, graph construction and propagation steps.

         The objective of the generation step is to populate the target graph with
         additional
         target phrases for all unlabeled source phrases, yielding the full set of possible translations for the phrase.
Prior to generation, one phrase node for each target phrase occurring in the baseline phrase table is added to the target graph (black nodes in Fig.
         1
         ’s target graph).
We only consider target phrases whose source phrase is a bigram, but it is worth noting that the target phrases are of variable length.

       <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p2">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         The generation component is based on the observation that for structured label spaces, such as translation candidates for source phrases in SMT, even similar phrases have slightly different labels (target translations).
The exponential dependence of the sizes of these spaces on the length of instances is to blame.
Thus, the target phrase inventory from the parallel corpus may be inadequate for unlabeled instances.
We therefore need to enrich the target or label space for unknown phrases.
A naïve way to achieve this goal would be to extract all
         n
         -grams, from
         n=1
         to a maximum
         n
         -gram order, from the monolingual data, but this strategy would lead to a combinatorial explosion in the number of target phrases.

         Instead, by intelligently expanding the target space using linguistic information such as morphology
         [25, 4]
         , or relying on the baseline system to generate candidates similar to self-training
         [17]
         , we can tractably propose novel translation candidates (white nodes in Fig.
         1
         ’s target graph) whose probabilities are then estimated during propagation.
We refer to these additional candidates as “generated” candidates.

       <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p4">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         To generate new translation candidates using the baseline system, we decode each unlabeled source bigram to generate its
         m
         -best translations.
This set of candidate phrases is filtered to include only
         n
         -grams occurring in the target monolingual corpus, and helps to prune passed-through OOV words and invalid translations.
To generate new translation candidates using morphological information, we morphologically segment words into prefixes, stem, and suffixes using linguistic resources.
We assume that a morphological analyzer which provides context-independent analysis of word types exists, and implements the functions
         stem
         (
         f
         ) and
         stem
         (
         e
         ) for source and target word types.
Based on these functions, source and target sequences of words can be mapped to sequences of stems.
The morphological generation step adds to the target graph all target word sequences from the monolingual data that map to the same stem sequence as one of the target phrases occurring in the baseline phrase table.
In other words, this step adds phrases that are morphological variants of existing phrases, differing only in their affixes.

        Graph Construction

        <p class="ltx_p">
         At this stage, there exists a list of source bigram phrases, both labeled and unlabeled, as well as a list of target language phrases of variable length, originating from both the phrase table and the generation step.
To determine pairwise phrase similarities in order to embed these nodes in their graphs, we utilize the monolingual corpora on both the source and target sides to extract distributional features based on the context surrounding each phrase.
For a phrase, we look at the
         p
         words before and the
         p
         words after the phrase, explicitly distinguishing between the two sides, but not distance (i.e., bag of words on each side).
Co-occurrence counts for each feature (context word) are accumulated over the monolingual corpus, and these counts are converted to pointwise mutual information (PMI) values, as is standard practice when computing distributional similarities.
Cosine similarity between two phrases’ PMI vectors is used for similarity, and we take only the
         k
         most similar phrases for each phrase, to create a
         k
         -nearest neighbor similarity matrix for both source and target language phrases.
These graphs are distinct, in that propagation happens within the two graphs but not between them.

         While accumulating co-occurrence counts for each phrase, we also maintain an inverted index data structure, which is a mapping from features (context words) to phrases that co-occur with that feature within a window of
         p
         .
         The inverted index structure reduces the graph construction cost from
         θ⁢(n2)
         , by only computing similarities for a subset of all possible pairs of phrases, namely other phrases that have at least one feature in common.

As a result, LP is suboptimal for our needs, since it is unable to appropriately handle generated translation candidates for the unlabeled phrases.

When propagating information from the labeled phrases, such candidates will obtain no probability mass since

Thus, due to the setup of the problem, LP naturally biases away from translation candidates produced during the generation step (§

        We performed an extensive evaluation to examine various aspects of the approach along with overall system performance.
Two language pairs were used: Arabic-English and Urdu-English.
The Arabic-English evaluation was used to validate the decisions made during the development of our method and also to highlight properties of the technique.
With it, in §
        3.2
        we first analyzed the impact of utilizing phrases instead of words and SLP instead of LP; the latter experiment underscores the importance of generated candidates.
We also look at how adding morphological knowledge to the generation process can further enrich performance.
In §
        3.3
        , we then examined the effect of using a very large 5-gram language model training on 7.5 billion English tokens to understand the nature of the improvements in §

The Urdu to English evaluation in §

        focuses on how noisy parallel data and completely monolingual (i.e., not even comparable) text can be used for a realistic low-resource language pair, and is evaluated with the larger language model only.

         ) compared to SLP (Eq.
         4
         ).
Recall that LP only takes into account source similarity; since the vast majority of generated candidates do not occur as labeled neighbors’ labels, restricting propagation to the source graph drastically reduces the usage of generated candidates as labels, but does not completely eliminate it.
In these experiments, we utilize a reasonably-sized 4-gram language model trained on 900m English tokens, i.e., the English monolingual corpus.

Using unigrams (“SLP 1-gram”) actually does worse than the baseline, indicating the importance of focusing on translations for sparser bigrams.
While LP (“LP 2-gram”) does reasonably well, its underperformance compared to SLP underlines the importance of enriching the translation space with generated candidates and handling these candidates appropriately.
         In “SLP-HalfMono”, we use only half of the monolingual comparable corpora, and still obtain an improvement of 0.56 BLEU points, indicating that adding more monolingual data is likely to improve the system further. Interestingly, biasing away from generated candidates using all the monolingual data (“LP 2-gram”) performs similarly to using half the monolingual corpora and handling generated candidates properly (“SLP-HalfMono”).

         The results from this setup are presented as “Baseline+Noisy” and “SLP” in Table
         6
         .
The two setups allow us to examine how effectively our method can learn from the noisy parallel data by treating it as monolingual (i.e., for graph construction), compared to treating this data as parallel, and also examines the realistic scenario of using completely non-comparable monolingual text for graph construction as in the second setup.

         In the first setup, we get a huge improvement of 4.2 BLEU points (“SLP+Noisy”) when using the monolingual data and the noisy parallel data for graph construction.
Our method obtained much of the gains achieved by the supervised baseline approach that utilizes the noisy parallel data in conjunction with the NIST-provided parallel data (“Baseline+Noisy”), but with fewer assumptions on the nature of the corpora (monolingual vs. parallel).
Furthermore, despite completely un-aligned, non-comparable monolingual text on the Urdu and English sides, and a very large language model, we can still achieve gains in excess of 1.2 BLEU points (“SLP”) in a difficult evaluation scenario, which shows that the technique adds a genuine translation improvement over and above naïve memorization of
         n
         -gram sequences.

         The Arabic-English examples are numbered 1 to 5.
The first example shows a source bigram unknown to the baseline system, resulting in a suboptimal translation, while our system proposes the correct translation of “sending reinforcements”.
The second example shows a word that was an OOV for the baseline system, while our system got a perfect translation.
The third and fourth examples represent bigram phrases with much better translations compared to backing off to the lexical translations as in the baseline.
The fifth Arabic-English example demonstrates the pitfalls of over-reliance on the distributional hypothesis: the source bigram corresponding to the name “abd almahmood” is distributional similar to another named entity “mahmood” and the English equivalent is offered as a translation.
The distributional hypothesis can sometimes be misleading.
The sixth example shows how morphological information can propose novel candidates: an OOV word is broken down to its stem via the analyzer and candidates are generated based on the stem.

         The Urdu-English examples are numbered 7 to 9.
In example 7, the bigram “par umeed” (corresponding to “hopeful”) is never seen in the baseline system, which has only seen “umeed” (“hope”).
By leveraging the monolingual corpus to understand the context of this unlabeled bigram, we can utilize the graph structure to propose a syntactically correct form, also resulting in a more fluent and correct sentence as determined by the language model.
Examples 8 &amp; 9 show cases where the baseline deletes words or translates them into more common words e.g., “conversation” to “the”, while our system proposes reasonable candidates.

        The idea presented in this paper is similar in spirit to bilingual lexicon induction (BLI), where a seed lexicon in two different languages is expanded with the help of monolingual corpora, primarily by extracting distributional similarities from the data using word context.
This line of work, initiated by
        Rapp (1995)
        and continued by others
        [7, 13]
        (
        inter alia
        ) is limited from a downstream perspective, as translations for only a small number of words are induced and oftentimes for common or frequently occurring ones only.
Recent improvements to BLI
        [24, 10]
        have contained a graph-based flavor by presenting label propagation-based approaches using a seed lexicon, but evaluation is once again done on top-1 or top-3 accuracy, and the focus is on unigrams.

        Razmara et al. (2013)
        and

        conduct a more extensive evaluation of their graph-based BLI techniques, where the emphasis and end-to-end BLEU evaluations concentrated on OOVs, i.e., unigrams, and not on enriching the entire translation model.
As with previous BLI work, these approaches only take into account source-side similarity of words; only moderate gains (and in the latter work, on a subset of language pairs evaluated) are obtained.
Additionally, because of our structured propagation algorithm, our approach is better at handling multiple translation candidates and does not need to restrict itself to the top translation.

        Klementiev et al. (2012)
        propose a method that utilizes a pre-existing phrase table and a small bilingual lexicon, and performs BLI using monolingual corpora.
The operational scope of their approach is limited in that they assume a scenario where unknown phrase pairs are provided (thereby sidestepping the issue of translation candidate generation for completely unknown phrases), and what remains is the estimation of phrasal
probabilities.
In our case, we obtain the phrase pairs from the graph structure (and therefore indirectly from the monolingual data) and a separate generation step, which plays an important role in good performance of the method. Similarly,
        Zhang and Zong (2013)
        present a series of heuristics that are applicable in a fairly narrow setting.

        The notion of translation consensus, wherein similar sentences on the source side are encouraged to have similar target language translations, has also been explored via a graph-based approach
        [1]
        .
        Liu et al. (2012)
        extend this method by proposing a novel structured label propagation algorithm to deal with the generalization of propagating
        sets
        of labels instead of single labels, and also integrated information from the graph into the decoder.
In fact, we utilize this algorithm in our propagation step (§
        2.4
        ).
However, the former work operates only at the level of sentences, and while the latter does extend the framework to sub-spans of sentences, they do not discover new translation pairs or phrasal probabilities for new pairs at all, but instead re-estimate phrasal probabilities using the graph structure and add this score as an additional feature during decoding.

        The goal of leveraging non-parallel data in machine translation has been explored from several different angles.
Paraphrases extracted by “pivoting” via a third language
        [3]
        can be derived solely from monolingual corpora using distributional similarity
        [16]
        .
        Snover et al. (2008)
        use cross-lingual information retrieval techniques to find potential sentence-level translation candidates among comparable corpora.
In this case, the goal is to try and construct a corpus as close to parallel as possible from comparable corpora, and is a fairly different take on the problem we are looking at.
Decipherment-based approaches
        [21, 6]
        have generally taken a monolingual view to the problem and combine phrase tables through the log-linear model during feature weight training.

       Conclusion
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        In this work, we presented an approach that can expand a translation model extracted from a sentence-aligned, bilingual corpus using a large amount of unstructured, monolingual data in both source and target languages, which leads to improvements of 1.4 and 1.2 BLEU points over strong baselines on evaluation sets, and in some scenarios gains in excess of 4 BLEU points.
In the future, we plan to estimate the graph structure through other learned, distributed representations.
