        Twitter sentiment classification has attracted increasing research interest in recent years
        [21, 20]
        . The objective is to classify the sentiment polarity of a tweet as positive, negative or neutral. The majority of existing approaches follow Pang et al.
        [33]
        and employ machine learning algorithms to build classifiers from tweets with manually annotated sentiment polarity. Under this direction, most studies focus on designing effective features to obtain better classification performance. For example,
        Mohammad et al. (2013)
        build the top-performed system in the Twitter sentiment classification track of SemEval 2013
        [31]
        , using diverse sentiment lexicons and a variety of hand-crafted features.

        Feature engineering is important but labor-intensive. It is therefore desirable to discover explanatory factors from the data and make the learning algorithms less dependent on extensive feature engineering
        [4]
        . For the task of sentiment classification, an effective feature learning method is to compose the representation of a sentence (or document) from the representations of the words or phrases it contains
        [40, 47]
        . Accordingly, it is a crucial step to learn the word representation (or word embedding), which is a dense, low-dimensional and real-valued vector for a word.
Although existing word embedding learning algorithms
        [9, 27]
        are intuitive choices,
they are not effective enough if directly used for sentiment classification.
The most serious problem is that traditional methods typically model the syntactic context of words but ignore the sentiment information of text. As a result, words with opposite polarity, such as
        good
        and
        bad
        , are mapped into close vectors. It is meaningful for some tasks such as pos-tagging
        [49]
        as the two words have similar usages and grammatical roles, but it becomes a disaster for sentiment analysis as they have the opposite sentiment polarity.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        In this paper, we propose learning sentiment-specific word embedding (
        SSWE
        ) for sentiment analysis.
We encode the sentiment information into the continuous representation of words, so that it is able to separate
        good
        and
        bad
        to opposite ends of the spectrum. To this end, we extend the existing word embedding learning algorithm
        [9]
        and develop three neural networks to effectively incorporate the supervision from sentiment polarity of text (e.g. sentences or tweets) in their loss functions.
We learn the sentiment-specific word embedding from tweets, leveraging massive tweets with emoticons as distant-supervised corpora without any manual annotations. These automatically collected tweets contain noises so they cannot be directly used as gold training data to build sentiment classifiers, but they are effective enough to provide weakly supervised signals for training the sentiment-specific word embedding.

        We apply SSWE as features in a supervised learning framework for Twitter sentiment classification, and evaluate it on the benchmark dataset in SemEval 2013. In the task of predicting positive/negative polarity of tweets, our method yields 84.89% in macro-F1 by only using SSWE as feature, which is comparable to the top-performed system based on hand-crafted features (84.70%).
After concatenating the SSWE feature with existing feature set, we push the state-of-the-art to 86.58% in macro-F1.
The quality of SSWE is also directly evaluated by measuring the word similarity in the embedding space for sentiment lexicons. In the accuracy of polarity consistency between each sentiment word and its top
        N
        closest words, SSWE outperforms existing word embedding learning algorithms.

         Twitter sentiment classification, which identifies the sentiment polarity of short, informal tweets, has attracted increasing research interest
         [21, 20]
         in recent years. Generally, the methods employed in Twitter sentiment classification follow traditional sentiment classification approaches.
The lexicon-based approaches
         [44, 11, 41, 42]
         mostly use a dictionary of sentiment words with their associated sentiment polarity, and incorporate negation and intensification to compute the sentiment polarity for each sentence (or document).

         Pang et al. (2002)
         ’s work, which treat sentiment classification of texts as a special case of text categorization issue.
Many studies on Twitter sentiment classification
         [32, 10, 1, 22, 48]
         leverage massive noisy-labeled tweets selected by positive and negative emoticons as training set and build sentiment classifiers directly, which is called
         distant supervision
         [17]
         .
Instead of directly using the distant-supervised data as training set, Liu et al.
         [25]
         adopt the tweets with emoticons to smooth the language model and Hu et al.
         [20]
         incorporate the emotional signals into an unsupervised learning framework for Twitter sentiment classification.

         Many existing learning based methods on Twitter sentiment classification focus on feature engineering. The reason is that the performance of sentiment classifier being heavily dependent on the choice of feature representation of tweets. The most representative system is introduced by Mohammad et al.

         , which is the state-of-the-art system (the top-performed system in SemEval 2013 Twitter Sentiment Classification Track) by implementing a number of hand-crafted features. Unlike the previous studies, we focus on learning discriminative features automatically from massive distant-supervised tweets.

         pioneer this field by using bag-of-word representation, representing each word as a one-hot vector. It has the same length as the size of the vocabulary, and only one dimension is 1, with all others being 0.
Under this assumption, many feature learning algorithms are proposed to obtain better classification performance
         [34, 24, 14]
         . However, the one-hot word representation cannot sufficiently capture the complex linguistic characteristics of words.

          As an unsupervised approach, C&amp;W model does not explicitly capture the sentiment information of texts. An intuitive solution to integrate the sentiment information is predicting the sentiment distribution of text based on input ngram.
We do not utilize the entire sentence as input because the length of different sentences might be variant. We therefore slide the window of ngram across a sentence, and then predict the sentiment polarity based on each ngram with a shared neural network.
In the neural network, the distributed representation of higher layer are interpreted as features describing the input. Thus, we utilize the continuous vector of top layer to predict the sentiment distribution of text.

          Distant supervision is relatively weak because the noisy-labeled tweets are treated as the gold standard, which affects the performance of classifier. The results of bag-of-ngram (uni/bi/tri-gram) features are not satisfied because the one-hot word representation cannot capture the latent connections between words. NBSVM and RAE perform comparably and have a big gap in comparison with the NRC and SSWE-based methods.

          From the first column of Table
          3
          , we can see that the performance of C&amp;W and word2vec are obviously lower than sentiment-specific word embeddings by only using unigram embedding as features.
The reason is that C&amp;W and word2vec do not explicitly exploit the sentiment information of the text, resulting in that the words with opposite polarity such as
          good
          and
          bad
          are mapped to close word vectors. When such word embeddings are fed as features to a Twitter sentiment classifier, the discriminative ability of sentiment words are weakened thus the classification performance is affected.

SSWE outperforms MVSA by exploiting more contextual information in the sentiment predictor function. SSWE outperforms ReEmb by leveraging more sentiment information from massive distant-supervised tweets. Among three sentiment-specific word embeddings, SSWE
          u

          From each row of Table
          3
          , we can see that the bigram and trigram embeddings consistently improve the performance of Twitter sentiment classification. The underlying reason is that
a phrase, which cannot be accurately represented by unigram embedding, is directly encoded into the ngram embedding as an idiomatic unit.
A typical case in sentiment analysis is that the composed phrase and multiword expression may have a different sentiment polarity than the individual words it contains, such as
          not [bad]
          and
          [great] deal of

       Conclusion
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        In this paper, we propose learning continuous word representations as features for Twitter sentiment classification under a supervised learning framework. We show that the word embedding learned by traditional neural networks are not effective enough for Twitter sentiment classification.
These methods typically only model the context information of words so that they cannot distinguish words with similar context but opposite sentiment polarity (e.g.
        good
        and
        bad
        ).
We learn sentiment-specific word embedding (SSWE) by integrating the sentiment information into the loss functions of three neural networks.
We train SSWE with massive distant-supervised tweets selected by positive and negative emoticons.
The effectiveness of SSWE has been implicitly evaluated by using it as features in sentiment classification on the benchmark dataset in SemEval 2013, and explicitly verified by measuring word similarity in the embedding space for sentiment lexicons.
Our unified model combining syntactic context of words and sentiment information of sentences yields the best performance in both experiments.
