       <p class="ltx_p">
        We extend a popular model, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), to unbounded streams of documents.
In order for inference to be practical in this setting it must use constant space asymptotically and
run in pseudo-linear time, perhaps O⁢(n) or O⁢(n⁢log⁡n).

        Canini et al. (2009) presented a method for LDA inference based on particle filters,
where a sample set of models is updated online with each new token observed from a stream.
In general, these models should be regularly resampled and rejuvenated using
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps over the history in order to improve
the efficiency of the particle filter [10]. The particle filter of Canini et al. (2009)
rejuvenates over independent draws from the history by storing all past observations
and states. This algorithm thus has linear storage complexity and is not an online
learning algorithm in a strict sense [6].

        In the current work we propose using reservoir sampling in the rejuvenation step
to reduce the storage complexity of the particle filter to O⁢(1). This improvement is practically
useful in the large-data setting and is also scientifically interesting in that it recovers some of the
cognitive plausibility which originally motivated Börschinger and Johnson (2012). However, in experiments
on the dataset studied by Canini et al. (2009), we show that rejuvenation does not benefit the particle filter’s
performance. Rather, performance is dominated by the effects of random initialization (a problem for
which we provide a correction while abiding by the same constraints as Canini et al. (2009)). This result
re-opens the question of whether rejuvenation is of practical importance in online learning for static Bayesian models.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        For a sequence of N words collected into documents of varying length, we denote the j-th word as wj,
and the document it occurs in as di. LDA [3] “explains” the occurrence of each word by postulating that
a document was generated by repeatedly: (1) sampling a topic z from θ(d), the document-specific mixture of T topics,
and (2) sampling a word w from ϕ(z), the probability distribution the z-th topic defines over the vocabulary.

        The goal is to infer θ and ϕ, under the model:

       <p class="ltx_p">ϕ(z) ∼ Dirichlet⁢(β).</p>

Bayesian inference [3], expectation propagation [17], and collapsed Gibbs sampling [11].

       <p class="ltx_p">
        A limitation of these techniques is they require multiple passes over the data to obtain good
samples of ϕ and θ . This requirement makes them impractical when the corpus is too large to fit directly
into memory and in particular when the corpus grows without bound. This motivates online learning techniques,
including sampling-based methods [2, 7] and stochastic variational inference [12, 15, 13].
However, where these approaches generally assume the ability to draw independent samples from the full dataset,
we consider the case when it is infeasible to access arbitrary elements from the history.
The one existing algorithm that can be directly applied under this constraint, to our knowledge,
is the streaming variational Bayes framework [4] in which the posterior is recursively updated as new data arrives
using a variational approximation.

       Online LDA Using Particle Filters.
      </h2>

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Particle filters are a family of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling algorithms designed to
estimate the posterior distribution of a system with dynamic state [8]. A particle filter approximates the posterior by
a weighted sample of points, or particles, from the state space. The particle cloud is updated recursively for
each new observation using importance sampling (an approach called sequential importance sampling).

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Canini et al. (2009) apply this approach to LDA after analytically integrating out ϕ and θ, obtaining a
Rao-Blackwellized particle filter [9] that estimates the collapsed posterior 𝐏(𝐳∣𝐰).
In this setting, the P particles are samples of the topic assignment vector 𝐳(p), and they are propagated forward
in state space one token at a time. In general, the larger P is, the more accurately we
approximate the posterior; for small P, the approximation of the tails of the posterior will be particularly
poor [19]. However, a larger value of P increases the runtime and storage requirements of the algorithm.

        Over time the particle weights tend to diverge. To combat this inefficiency, after
every state transition we estimate the effective sample size (ESS) of the particle weights as ∥ωi∥2-2 [14]
and resample the particles when that estimate drops below a prespecified threshold. Several resampling strategies
have been proposed [9]. we perform multinomial resampling as in Pitt and Shephard (1999) and Ahmed et al. (2011),

        The rejuvenation sequence can be chosen by the practitioner. Choosing a long sequence (large |ℛ⁢(i)|) may
result in a more accurate posterior approximation but also increases runtime and storage requirements.
The tokens in ℛ⁢(i) may be chosen uniformly at random from the history or under a biased scheme that favors
recent observations. The particle filter studied empirically by Canini et al. (2009) stored the entire history,
incurring linear storage complexity in the size of the stream. Ahmed et al. (2011) instead sampled ten documents
from the most recent 1000, achieving constant storage complexity at the cost of a recency bias.
If we want to fit a model to a long non-i.i.d stream, we require an unbiased rejuvenation sequence
as well as sub-linear storage complexity.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Reservoir sampling is a widely-used family of algorithms for choosing an array (“reservoir”) of k items.
The most common example, presented in Vitter (1985) as Algorithm R, chooses k elements of a stream such that
each possible subset of k elements is equiprobable. This effects sampling k items uniformly without replacement,
using runtime O⁢(n) (constant per update) and storage O⁢(k).

        To ensure constant space over an unbounded stream, we draw the rejuvenation sequence ℛ⁢(i)
uniformly from a reservoir. As each token of the training data is ingested by the particle filter,
we decide to insert that token into the reservoir, or not, independent of the other tokens in the
current document. Thus, at the end of step i of the particle filter, each of the i tokens seen so
far in the training sequence has an equal probability of being in the reservoir, hence being selected for rejuvenation.

In addition, we remove the header of every file and filter every line that does not contain a non-trailing space

in practice [23]; we increase the number of sweeps to five after inspecting the stability on our dataset.

         We observed previously that variance in the Gibbs initialization of the model contributes significantly to
variance of the overall algorithm, as measured by NMI. With this in mind, we consider whether we can reduce
variance in the initialization by tuning the initial model. Thus we perform a set of experiments in which we
perform Gibbs initialization 20 times on the initialization set, setting the particle filter’s initial model to
the model out of these 20 with the highest in-sample NMI. This procedure is performed independently for each run
of the particle filter. We may not always have labeled data for initialization, so we also consider a variation
in which Gibbs initialization is performed 20 times on the first 80% of the initialization sample, held-out
perplexity (per word) is estimated on the remaining 20%, using a first-moment particle learning approximation [20],
and the particle filter is started from the model out of these 20 with the lowest held-out perplexity.
The results, shown in Figure 3, show that we can ameliorate the variance due to initialization by tuning
the initial model to NMI or perplexity.

that rejuvenation improved performance [6], but this impaired cognitive plausibility by necessitating storage
of all previous states and observations. We attempted to correct this by drawing the rejuvenation sequence
from a reservoir, but our results indicate that the particle filter for LDA on our dataset is highly sensitive to
initialization and not influenced by rejuvenation.

        In the experiments of Börschinger and Johnson (2012), the particle cloud appears to be resampled
once per utterance with a large rejuvenation sequence; each particle takes many more rejuvenation MCMC steps than
new state transitions and thus resembles a batch MCMC sampler. In our experiments resampling is done on the
order of once per document, leading to less than one rejuvenation step per transition.
Future work should carefully note this ratio: sampling history much more often than new states improves performance
but contradicts the intuition behind particle filters.

        We have also shown that tuning the initial model using in-sample NMI or held-out perplexity can improve
mean NMI and reduce variance. Perplexity (or likelihood) is often used to estimate model performance in LDA
[3, 11, 22, 12], and does not compare the inferred model against gold-standard labels, yet it appears
to be a good proxy for NMI in our experiment. Thus, if initialization continues to be crucial to performance,
at least we may have the flexibility of initializing without gold-standard labels.

        We have focused on NMI as our evaluation metric for comparison with Canini et al. (2009).
However, evaluation of topic models is a subject of considerable debate [22, 23, 18, 16] and it may be
informative to investigate the effects of initialization and rejuvenation using other metrics such as
perplexity or semantic coherence.

       Conclusion

       <p class="ltx_p">
        We have proposed reservoir sampling for reducing the storage complexity
of a particle filter from linear to constant. This work was motivated
as an expected improvement on the model of Canini et al. (2009). However,
in the process of establishing an empirical baseline we discovered that
rejuvenation does not play a significant role in the experiments of Canini et al. (2009).
Moreover, we found that performance of the particle
filter was strongly affected by the random initialization of the model,
and suggested a simple approach to reduce the variability therein
without using additional data. In conclusion, it is now an open question
whether—and if so, under what assumptions—rejuvenation benefits
particle filters for LDA and similar static Bayesian models.
