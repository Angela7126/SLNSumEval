       Introduction

       <p class="ltx_p">
        The phenomenon of filler-gap, where the argument of a predicate appears outside its canonical position in the phrase structure (e.g.
        [the apple]i that the boy ate ti
        or
        [what]i did the boy eat ti
        ), has long been an object of study for syntacticians
        []
        due to its apparent processing complexity.
Such complexity is due, in part, to the arbitrary length of the dependency between a filler and its gap (e.g.
        [the apple]i that Mary said the boy ate ti
        ).

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Recent studies indicate that comprehension of filler-gap constructions begins around 15 months
        []
        .
This finding raises the question of how such a complex phenomenon could be acquired so early since children at that age do not yet have a very advanced grasp of language (e.g. ditransitives do not seem to be generalized until at least 31 months; Goldberg et al. 2004
        , Bello 2012
        ).
This work shows that filler-gap comprehension in English may be acquired through learning word orderings rather than relying on hierarchical syntactic knowledge.

        This work describes a cognitive model of the developmental timecourse of filler-gap comprehension with the goal of setting a lower bound on the modeling assumptions necessary for an ideal learner to display filler-gap comprehension.
In particular, the model described in this paper takes chunked child-directed speech as input and learns orderings over semantic roles.
These orderings then permit the model to successfully resolve filler-gap dependencies.
        Further, the model presented here is also shown to initially reflect an idiosyncratic role assignment error observed in development (e.g.
        A and B kradded
        interpreted as
        A kradded B
        ; Gertner and Fisher, 2012
        ), though after training, the model is able to avoid the error.
As such, this work may be said to model a learner from 15 months to between 25 and 30 months.

       Background
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        The developmental timeline during which children acquire the ability to process filler-gap constructions is not well-understood.
Language comprehension precedes production, and the developmental literature on the acquisition of filler-gap constructions is sparsely populated due to difficulties in designing experiments to test filler-gap comprehension in preverbal infants.
Older studies typically looked at verbal children and the mistakes they make to gain insight into the acquisition process
        []
        .
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Recent studies, however, indicate that filler-gap comprehension likely begins earlier than production
        []
        .
Therefore, studies of verbal children are probably actually testing the acquisition of production mechanisms (planning, motor skills, greater facility with lexical access, etc) rather than the acquisition of filler-gap.
Note that these may be related since filler-gap could introduce greater processing load which could overwhelm the child’s fragile production capacity
        []
        .

        showed that children are able to process
        wh
        -extractions from subject position (e.g.
        [who]i ti ate pie
        ) as young as 15 months while similar extractions from object position (e.g.
        [what]i did the boy eat ti
        ) remain unparseable until around 20 months of age.
        This line of investigation has been reopened and expanded by
        whose results suggest that the experimental methodology employed by
        was flawed in that it presumed infants have ideal performance mechanisms.
By providing more trials of each condition and controlling for the pragmatic felicity of test statements,
        provide evidence that 15-month old infants can process
        wh
        -extractions from both subject and object positions.
Object extractions are more difficult to comprehend than subject extractions, however, perhaps due to additional processing load in object extractions
        []
        .
Similarly,
        show that relativized extractions with a
        wh
        -relativizer (e.g.
        find [the boy]i who ti ate the apple
        ) are easier to comprehend than relativized extractions with
        that
        as the relativizer (e.g.
        find [the boy]i that ti ate the apple
        ).

        demonstrate that 19-month olds use their knowledge of nouns to learn both verbs and their associated argument structure.
In their study, infants were shown video of a person talking on a phone using a nonce verb with either one or two nouns (e.g.
        Mary kradded Susan
        ).
Under the assumption that infants look longer at things that correspond to their understanding of a prompt, the infants were then shown two images that potentially depicted the described action – one picture where two actors acted independently (reflecting an intransitive proposition) and one picture where one actor acted on the other (reflecting a transitive proposition).
        Even though the infants had no extralinguistic knowledge about the verb, they consistently treated the verb as transitive if two nouns were present and intransitive if only one noun was present.

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p5">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Similarly,
        show that intransitive phrases with conjoined subjects (e.g.
        John and Mary gorped
        ) are given a transitive interpretation (i.e.
        John gorped Mary
        ) at 21 months (henceforth termed ‘1-1 role bias’), though this effect is no longer present at 25 months
        []
        .
This finding suggests both that learners will ignore canonical structure in favor of using all possible arguments and that children have a bias to assign a unique semantic role to each argument.
It is important to note, however, that cross-linguistically children do not seem to generalize beyond two arguments until after at least 31 months of age
        []
        , so a predicate occurring with three nouns would still likely be interpreted as merely transitive rather than ditransitive.

That is, given the input (child-directed speech, adult-directed speech, and environmental experiences), it is possible to probe the computational processes that result in the observed output.
However, previous computational models of grammar induction

        The closest work to that presented here is the work on BabySRL

BabySRL is a computational model of semantic role acquistion using a similar set of assumptions to the current work.
BabySRL learns weights over ordering constraints (e.g. preverbal, second noun, etc.) to acquire semantic role labelling while still exhibiting 1-1 role bias.
However, no analysis has evaluated the ability of BabySRL to acquire filler-gap constructions.

       Assumptions
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        The present work restricts itself to acquiring filler-gap comprehension in English.
The model presented here learns a single, non-recursive ordering for the semantic roles in each sentence relative to the verb since several studies have suggested that early child grammars may consist of simple linear grammars that are dictated by semantic roles
        []
        .
This work assumes learners can already identify nouns and verbs, which is supported by
        who show that children at an extremely young age can distinguish between content and function words and by
        who show that children can distinguish between different types of content words.
Further, since
        demonstrate that, by 14 months, children are able to distinguish nouns from modifiers, this work assumes learners can already chunk nouns and access the nominal head.
To handle recursion, this work assumes that children treat the final verb in each sentence as the main verb (implicitly assuming sentence segmentation), which ideally assigns roles to each of the nouns in the sentence.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Due to the findings of
        , this work adopts a ‘syntactic bootstrapping’ theory of acquisition
        []
        , where structural properties (e.g. number of nouns) inform the learner about semantic properties of a predicate (e.g. how many semantic roles it confers).
Since infants infer the number of semantic roles, this work further assumes they already have expectations about where these roles tend to be realized in sentences, if they appear.
These positions may correspond to different semantic roles for different predicates (e.g. the subject of
        run
        and of
        melt
        ); however, the role for predicates with a single argument is usually assigned to the noun that precedes the verb while a second argument is usually assigned after the verb.
The semantic properties of these roles may be learned lexically for each predicate, but that is beyond the scope of this work.
Therefore, this work uses syntactic and semantic roles interchangeably (e.g.
        subject
        and
        agent
        ).

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Finally, following the finding by
        that children interpret intransitives with conjoined subjects as transitives, this work assumes that semantic roles have a one-to-one correspondence with nouns in a sentence (similarly used as a soft constraint in the semantic role labelling work of Titov and Klementiev, 2012)

       Model
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        The model represents the preferred locations of semantic roles relative to the verb as distributions over real numbers.
This idea is adapted from
        who uses it to learn constraint rankings in optimality theory.

        In this work, the final (main) verb is placed at position 0; words (and chunks) before the verb are given progressively more negative positions, and words after the verb are given progressively more positive positions (see Table
        1
        ).
Learner expectations of where an argument will appear relative to the verb are modelled as two-component Gaussian mixtures: one mixture of Gaussians (
        GS⁣⋅
        ) corresponds to the subject argument, another (
        GO⁣⋅
        ) corresponds to the object argument.
There is no mixture for a third argument since children do not generalize beyond two arguments until later in development
        []
        .

      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p3">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        One component of each mixture learns to represent the canonical position for the argument (
        G⋅C
        ) while the other (
        G⋅N
        ) represents some alternate, non-canonical position such as the filler position in filler-gap constructions.
To reflect the fact that learners have had 15 months of exposure to their language before acquiring filler-gap, the mixture is initialized so that there is a stronger probability associated with the canonical Gaussian than with the non-canonical Gaussian of each mixture.
        Finally, the one-to-one role bias is explicitly encoded such that the model cannot use a label that has already been used elsewhere in the sentence.

        Thus, the initial model conditions (see Figure
        2
        ) are most likely to realize an SVO ordering, although it is possible to obtain SOV (by sampling a negative number from the blue curve) or even OSV (by also sampling the red curve very close to 0).
The model is most likely to hypothesize a preverbal object when it has already assigned the subject role to something and, in addition, there is no postverbal noun competing for the object label.
In other words, the model infers that an object extraction may have occurred if there is a ‘missing’ postverbal argument.

        Finally, the probability of a given sequence is the product of the label probabilities for the component argument positions (e.g.
        GS⁢C
        generating an argument at position -2, etc).
Since many sentences have more than two nouns, the model is allowed to skip nouns by multiplying a penalty term (
        Φ
        ) into the product for each skipped noun; the cost is set at 0.00001 for this study, though see Section
        7
        for a discussion of the constraints on this parameter.

        This work uses a model with 2-component mixtures for both subjects and objects (termed the
        symmetric model
        ).
This formulation achieves the best fit to the training data according to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
        However, follow-up experiments find that the non-canonical subject Gaussian only improves the likelihood of the data by erroneously modeling postverbal nouns in imperative statements.
The lack of a canonical subject in English imperatives allows the model to improve the likelihood of the data by using the non-canonical subject Gaussian to capture fictitious postverbal arguments.
When imperatives are filtered out of the training corpus, the symmetric model obtains a worse BIC fit than a model that lacks the non-canonical subject Gaussian.
Therefore, if one makes the assumption that imperatives are prosodically-marked for learners (e.g. the learner is the implicit subject), the best model is one that lacks a non-canonical subject.
        The remainder of this paper assumes a symmetric model to demonstrate what happens if such an assumption is not made; for the evaluations described in this paper, the results are similar in either case.

        This model differs from other non-recursive computational models of grammar induction (e.g. Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007)

Instead, it determines the best ordering for the sentence as a whole.
This approach bears some similarity to a Generalized Mallows model

Poor chunker perfomance is likely due to a mismatch in chunker training and testing domains (Wall Street Journal text vs transcribed speech), but chunking noise may be a good estimation of learner uncertainty, so the remaining text is left uncorrected.
All noun phrase chunks are then replaced with their final noun (presumed the head) to approximate the ability of children to distinguish nouns from modifiers

        Viterbi Expectation-Maximization is performed over each sentence in the corpus to infer the parameters of the model.
During the Expectation step, the model uses the current Gaussian parameters to label the nouns in each sentence with argument roles.

This is unsurprising because, prior to training, subjects have little-to-no competition for preverbal role assignments; after training, there is a preverbal extracted object category, which the model can erroneously use.
This slight, though significant in Eve, deficit is counter-balanced by a very substantial and significant improvement in object-extraction labelling accuracy.

        The acquisition of semantic role labelling (SRL) by the BabySRL model

        bears many similarities to the current work and is, to our knowledge, the only comparable line of inquiry to the current one.
The primary function of BabySRL is to model the acquisition of semantic role labelling while making an idiosyncratic error which infants also make

        , the 1-1 role bias error (
        John and Mary gorped
        interpreted as
        John gorped Mary

Similar to the model presented in this paper, BabySRL is based on simple ordering features such as argument position relative to the verb and argument position relative to the other arguments.

        This section will demonstrate that the model in this paper initially reflects 1-1 role bias comparably to BabySRL, though it progresses beyond this bias after training.
        Further, the model in this paper is able to reflect the concurrent acquisition of filler-gap whereas BabySRL does not seem well-suited to such a task.
Finally, BabySRL performs undesirably in intransitive settings whereas the model in this paper does not.

A comparable evaluation may be run on the current model by generating 1000 sentences with a structure of NNV and reporting how many times the model chooses a subject-first labelling (see Table

        As with subject extraction, the model in this paper gets less accurate after training because of the newly minted extracted object category that can be mistakenly used in these canonical settings.
While the model of
        outperforms the model presented here when in a transitive setting, their model does much worse in an intransitive setting.
The difference in transitive settings stems from increased lexicalization, as is apparent from their results alone; the model presented here initially performs close to their weakly lexicalized model, though training impedes agent-prediction accuracy due to an increased probability of non-canonical objects.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        For the intransitive case, however, whereas the model presented in this paper is generally able to successfully label the lone noun as the subject, the model of
        chooses to label lone nouns as objects about 40% of the time.
This likely stems from their model’s reliance on argument-argument relative position as a feature; when there is no additional argument to use for reference, the model’s accuracy decreases.
This is borne out by their model (not shown in Table
        7
        ) that omits the argument-argument relative position feature and solely relies on verb-argument position, which achieves up to 70% accuracy in intransitive settings.
Even in that case, however, BabySRL still chooses to label lone nouns as objects 30% of the time.
The fact that intransitive sentences are more common than transitive sentences in both the Eve and Adam sections of the BabySRL corpus suggests that learners should be more likely to assign correct roles in an intransitive setting, which is not reflected in the BabySRL results.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        The overall reason for the different results between the current work and BabySRL is that BabySRL relies on positional features that measure the relative position of two individual elements (e.g. where a given noun is relative to the verb).
Since the model in this paper operates over global orderings, it implicitly takes into account the positions of other nouns as it models argument position relative to the verb; object and subject are in competition as labels for preverbal nouns, so a preverbal object is usually only assigned once a subject has already been detected.

      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p11">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Further, while BabySRL consistently reflects 1-1 role bias (corresponding to a pre 25-month old learner), it also learns to productively label five roles, which developmental studies have shown does not take place until at least 31 months
        []
        .
Finally, it does not seem likely that BabySRL could be easily extended to capture filler-gap acquisition.
The argument-verb position features impede acquisition of filler-gap by classifying preverbal arguments as agents, and the argument-argument position features inhibit accurate labelling in intransitive settings and result in an agent-first bias which would tend to label extracted objects as agents.
In fact, these observations suggest that any linear classifier which relies on positioning features will have difficulties modeling filler-gap acquisition.

        In sum, the unlexicalized model presented in this paper is able to achieve greater labelling accuracy than the lexicalized BabySRL models in intransitive settings, though this model does perform slightly worse in the less common transitive setting.
Further, the unsupervised model in this paper initially reflects developmental 1-1 role bias as well as the supervised BabySRL models, and it is able to progress beyond this bias.
Finally, unlike BabySRL, the model presented here provides a cognitive model of the acquisition of filler-gap comprehension, which BabySRL does not seem well-suited to model.

       Discussion
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        This paper has presented a simple cognitive model of filler-gap acquisition, which is able to capture several findings from developmental psychology.
Training significantly improves role labelling in the case of object-extractions, which improves the overall accuracy of the model.
This boost is accompanied by a slight decrease in labelling accuracy in subject-extraction settings.
The asymmetric ease of subject versus object comprehension is well-documented in both children and adults
        []
        , and while training improves the model’s ability to process object-extractions, there is still a gap between object-extraction and subject-extraction comprehension even after training.

        Further, the model exhibits better comprehension of
        wh
        -relatives than
        that
        -relatives similar to children
        []
        .
This could also be an area where a lexicalized model could do better.
As
        point out, whereas
        wh
        -relatives such as
        who
        or
        which
        always signify a filler-gap construction,
        that
        can occur for many different reasons (demonstrative, determiner, complementizer, etc) and so is a much weaker filler-gap cue.
A lexical model could potentially pick up on clues which could indicate when
        that
        is a relativizer or simply improve on its comprehension of
        wh
        -relatives even more.

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S7.p3">

        It is interesting to note that the cuurent model does not make use of
        that
        as a cue at all and yet is still slower at acquiring
        that
        -relatives than
        wh
        -relatives.
This fact suggests that the findings of
        may be partially explained by a frequency effect: perhaps the input to children is simply biased such that
        wh
        -relatives are much more common than
        that
        -relatives (as shown in Table

        []

        Finally, this model is extremely robust to different initializations.
The canonical Gaussian expectations can begin far from the verb (
        ±3
        ) or close to the verb (
        ±0.1
        ), and the standard deviations of the distributions and the skip-penalty can vary widely; the model always converges to give comparable results to those presented here.
The only constraint on the initial parameters is that the probability of the extracted object occurring preverbally must exceed the skip-penalty (i.e. extraction must be possible).
In short, this paper describes a simple, robust cognitive model of the development of a learner between 15 months until somewhere between 25- and 30-months old (since 1-1 role bias is no longer present but no more than two arguments are being generalized).

        In future, it would be interesting to incorporate lexicalization into the model presented in this paper, as this feature seems likely to bridge the gap between this model and BabySRL in transitive settings.
Lexicalization should also help further distinguish modifiers from arguments and improve the overall accuracy of the model.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        It would also be interesting to investigate how well this model generalizes to languages besides English.
Since the model is able to use the verb position as a semi-permeable boundary between canonical subjects and objects, it may not work as well in verb-final languages, and thus makes the prediction that filler-gap comprehension may be acquired later in development in such languages due to a greater reliance on hierarchical syntax.

        Ordering is one of the definining characteristics of a language that must be acquired by learners (e.g. SVO vs SOV), and this work shows that filler-gap comprehension can be acquired as a by-product of learning orderings rather than having to resort to higher-order syntax.
Note that this model cannot capture the constraints on filler-gap usage which require a hierarchical grammar (e.g. subjacency), but such knowledge is really only needed for successful production of filler-gap constructions, which occurs much later (around 5 years; de Villiers and Roeper, 1995)
        .
Further, the kind of ordering system proposed in this paper may form an initial basis for learning such grammars
