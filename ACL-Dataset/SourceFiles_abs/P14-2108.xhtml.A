        We present the
first parsing results for the Penn Parsed
Corpus of Modern British English (PPCMBE)
        []
        , showing that it can be parsed at a
few points lower in F-score than the Penn Treebank (PTB)
        []
        . We discuss some of the
differences in annotation style and source material
that make a direct comparison problematic. Some first steps at analysis of the
parsing results indicate aspects of the annotation style that are difficult for the
parser, and also show that the parser is creating structures that are not present in the
training material.

        The PPCMBE is a million-word treebank created for researching
changes in English syntax.
It covers the years 1700-1914 and is
the most modern in the series of treebanks created for historical
research.
        Due to the historical nature of the PPCMBE,
it shares some of the characteristics of treebanks based on modern unedited text
        []
        , such as spelling variation.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        The size of the PPCMBE is
roughly the same as the WSJ section of the PTB, and its annotation style
is similar to that
of the PTB, but with differences, particularly
with regard to coordination and NP structure.
However, except for
        ,
we have found no discussion of this corpus in the literature.
        There is also much additional material annotated in this style,
increasing the importance of analyzing parser performance
on this annotation style.

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        The PPCMBE
        consists of 101 files, but we leave aside
7 files that consist of legal material
with very different properties than the rest of the corpus. The remaining 94 files
contain 1,018,736 tokens (words).

        Part-of-speech tags
       </h3>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         The PPCMBE uses a part-of-speech (POS) tag set containing
248 POS tags, in contrast to the 45 tags used by the PTB. The more complex tag set
is mainly due to the desire to tag orthographic variants consistently
throughout the series of historical corpora.
For example “gentlemen” and its orthographic variant
“gen’l’men” are tagged with the complex tag
         <code class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">
          ADJ+NS
         </code>
         (adjective
and plural noun) on the grounds that in earlier time
periods, the lexical item is spelled and tagged as two orthographic
words (“gentle”/ADJ and “men”/NS).
        </p>
       </div>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p2">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         While only 81 of the 248 tags are “simple” (i.e., not associated with
lexical merging or splitting), they cover the vast majority of the words in the corpus, as
summarized in Table
         1
         . Of these 81 tags, some are more specialized than
in the PTB, accounting for the increased number of tags
compared to the PTB. For instance, for historical consistency, words like “one” and “else”
each have their own tag.

         <p class="ltx_p">
          Neither the PPCMBE nor the PTB distinguish between PP complements and modifiers of nouns. However, the PPCMBE annotates
both types of dependents as sisters of the noun, while the PTB adjoins both types. For instance in (
          3
          a) in
Figure
          3
          , the modifier PP is a sister to the noun in the PPCMBE, while in (
          3
          b), the complement PP is adjoined in the PTB.

         <p class="ltx_p">
          Clausal complements and modifiers are also
both treated as sisters to the noun in the PPCMBE. In this case, though, the complement/modifier
distinction is encoded by a function tag. For example, in (
          3
          a) and
(
          3
          b), the status of the CPs as modifier and complement is indicated
by their function tags:
          REL
          for relative
clause and
          THT
          “that” complement. In the PTB, the distinction would be
encoded structurally; the relative clause would be adjoined, whereas the “that” complement would not.

          The major difference in the clausal structure as compared to the PTB is the absence
of a VP level

        We refer to the pre-release

        as the “Release” version, and experiment
with three other corpus versions.

       <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS1.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         As mentioned earlier, the PPCMBE’s relatively large POS tag set aims to maximize
annotation consistency across the entire time period covered by the historical corpora,
beginning with Middle English. Since we are concerned here with parsing just the PPCMBE, we
simplified the tag set.
        </p>
       </div>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS1.p2">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         The complex tags are simplified in a fully deterministic way, based on the trees and the tags. For example, the POS tag for
“gentleman”, originally
         <code class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">
          ADJ+N
         </code>
         is changed to
         <code class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">
          N
         </code>
         . The
         <code class="ltx_verbatim ltx_font_typewriter">
          P
         </code>
         tag is split, so that
it is either left as P, if a preposition, or changed to CONJS, if a subordinating conjunction.
The reduced tag set contains 76 tags. We call the version of the corpus with the reduced tag set the
“Reduced” version.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         As discussed in Section
         2.2.2
         , noun modifiers are sisters to the noun, instead of being adjoined,
as in the PTB. As a result, there are fewer NP brackets in the PPCMBE
than there would be if the PTB-style were followed. To evaluate
the effect of the difference in annotation guidelines on
the parsing score, we added PTB-style NP brackets to the reduced corpus described
in Section
         3.1
         . For example,
(
         3
         a) in Figure
         3
         is transformed into (
         5
         a) in Figure
         5
         , and likewise (
         3
         a) is transformed into (
         5
         b). However,
(
         3
         b) remains as it is, because the following CP in that case is a complement,
as indicated by the
         THT
         function tag.
This is a significant transformation of the corpus, adding 43,884 NPs to the already-existing 291,422.

         We carry out a similar transformation to add VP nodes to the IPs in the Reduced

         NPs version,
making them more like the
clausal structures in the PTB. This added 169,877 VP nodes to the corpus (there are 131,671 IP nodes,

years 1711-1860),
the development section consists of the four files beginning with “l” (1753-1866), the test
section consists of the five files beginning with “f” (1749-1900),
and the training section consists of the remaining 81 files
(1712-1913).
The data split sizes used here for the PPCMBE closely approximate that used for
the PTB, as described in
        .
        For this first work,
we used a split that was roughly the same as far as time-spans across the
four sections. In future work, we will do a more proper cross-validation evaluation.

We used the Train and Val sections for training, with the parser

“be” (BE) and “teaching“ (VAG) do not appear in this configuration at all in the training material.
In general, the parser seems to be getting confused as to when such an IP should appear. We
hypothesized that this is due to confusion with infinitival clauses, which can have an unary-branching IP over
a VP, as in the gold tree (
        6
        ). We retrained the parser, directing it to retain the INF
function tag that appears in infinitival clauses as in (
        6
        ). Overall, the evalb score went down slightly,
but it did fix cases such as (
        6
        b).
We do not yet know why the overall score went down, but
what’s surprising is one would have thought that IP-INF is recoverable from the absence of a tensed verb.

        Preliminary analysis shows that the CONJP structures are also difficult for the parser. Since these are structures that
are different than the PTB
        , we were particularly interested in them. Cases where the CONJP is missing
an overt coordinating
cord (such as “and”), are particularly difficult, not surprisingly. These can appear as intermediate conjuncts in
a string of conjuncts, with the structure
        (CONJP word)
        . The shared pre-modifier structure described in (
        2
        a)
is also difficult for the parser.

        We have presented the first results on parsing the PPCMBE and discussed some significant annotation style differences from the
PTB.
Adjusting for two major differences that are a matter of annotation convention, we showed that the PPCMBE
can be parsed at approximately the same level of accuracy
as the PTB. The first steps in an investigation of the parser differences show that the parser is generating structures
that violate basic well-formedness conditions of the annotation.

        For future work, we will carry out a more serious analysis of the parser output, trying to more properly account for the differences
in bracketing structure between the PPCMBE and PTB.
There is also a great deal of data annotated in the style of the PPCMBE, as indicated in footnotes
        1
        and
        1
        , and
we are interested in how the parser performs on these, especially comparing the results on the modern English corpora to the older
historical ones, which will have greater issues of orthographic and tokenization complications.
