        The ability to extract sentiment from text is crucial for many opinion-mining applications such as opinion summarization, opinion question answering and opinion retrieval. Accordingly, extracting sentiment at the fine-grained level (e.g. at the sentence- or phrase-level) has received increasing attention recently due to its challenging nature and its importance in supporting these opinion analysis tasks
        [18]
        .

        In this paper, we focus on the task of sentence-level sentiment classification in online reviews. Typical approaches to the task employ supervised machine learning algorithms with rich features and take into account the interactions between words to handle compositional effects such as polarity reversal (e.g.
        [16, 23]
        ). Still, their methods can encounter difficulty when the sentence on its own does not contain strong enough sentiment signals (due to the lack of statistical evidence or the requirement for background knowledge). Consider the following review for example,
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
       <blockquote class="ltx_quote">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         1. Hearing the music in real stereo is a true revelation. 2. You can feel that the music is no longer constrained by the mono recording. 3. In fact, it is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you …

        Existing feature-based classifiers may be effective in identifying the positive sentiment of the first sentence due to the use of the word
        revelation
        , but they could be less effective in the last two sentences due to the lack of explicit sentiment signals. However, if we examine these sentences within the discourse context, we can see that: the second sentence expresses sentiment towards the same aspect –
        the music
        – as the first sentence; the third sentence expands the second sentence with the discourse connective
        In fact
        . These discourse-level relations help indicate that sentence 2 and 3 are likely to have positive sentiment as well.

        The importance of discourse for sentiment analysis has become increasingly recognized. Most existing work considers discourse relations between adjacent sentences or clauses and incorporates them as constraints
        [11, 31]
        or features in classifiers
        Trivedi and Eisenstein (2013), Lazaridou et al. (2013)
        . Very little work has explored long-distance discourse relations for sentiment analysis.
        Somasundaran et al. (2008)
        defines coreference relations on opinion targets and applies them to constrain the polarity of sentences. However, the discourse relations were obtained from fine-grained annotations and implemented as hard constraints on polarity.

        Obtaining sentiment labels at the fine-grained level is costly. Semi-supervised techniques have been proposed for sentence-level sentiment classification
        [27, 21]
        . However, they rely on a large amount of document-level sentiment labels that may not be naturally available in many domains.

        In this paper, we propose a sentence-level sentiment classification method that can (1) incorporate rich discourse information at both local and global levels; (2) encode discourse knowledge as soft constraints during learning; (3) make use of unlabeled data to enhance learning. Specifically, we use the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model as the learner for sentence-level sentiment classification, and incorporate rich discourse and lexical knowledge as soft constraints into the learning of CRF parameters via Posterior Regularization (PR)
        [7]
        . As a framework for structured learning with constraints, PR has been successfully applied to many structural NLP tasks
        [6, 7, 5]
        . Our work is the first to explore PR for sentiment analysis. Unlike most previous work, we explore a rich set of structural constraints that cannot be naturally encoded in the feature-label form, and show that such constraints can improve the performance of the CRF model.

        There has been a large amount of work on sentiment analysis at various levels of granularity
        [18]
        . In this paper, we focus on the study of sentence-level sentiment classification. Existing machine learning approaches for the task can be classified based on the use of two ideas. The first idea is to exploit sentiment signals at the sentence level by learning the relevance of sentiment and words while taking into account the context in which they occur:
        Nakagawa et al. (2010)
        uses tree-CRF to model word interactions based on dependency tree structures;
        Choi and Cardie (2008)
        applies compositional inference rules to handle polarity reversal;
        Socher et al. (2011)
        and
        Socher et al. (2013)
        compute compositional vector representations for words and phrases and use them as features in a classifier.

      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        The second idea is to exploit sentiment signals at the inter-sentential level.
        Polanyi and Zaenen (2006)
        argue that discourse structure is important in polarity classification. Various attempts have been made to incorporate discourse relations into sentiment analysis:
        Pang and Lee (2004)
        explored the consistency of subjectivity between neighboring sentences;
        Mao and Lebanon (2007)
        ,
        McDonald et al. (2007)
        , and
        Täckström and McDonald (2011a)
        developed structured learning models to capture sentiment dependencies between adjacent sentences;
        Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006)
        and
        Zhou et al. (2011)
        use discourse relations to constrain two text segments to have either the same polarity or opposite polarities;
        Trivedi and Eisenstein (2013)
        and
        Lazaridou et al. (2013)
        encode the discourse connectors as model features in supervised classifiers. Very little work has explored long-distance discourse relations.
        Somasundaran et al. (2008)
        define opinion target relations and apply them to constrain the polarity of text segments annotated with target relations. Recently,
        Zhang et al. (2013)
        explored the use of explanatory discourse relations as soft constraints in a Markov Logic Network framework for extracting subjective text segments.

        Leveraging both ideas, our approach exploits sentiment signals from both intra-sentential and inter-sentential context. It has the advantages of utilizing rich discourse knowledge at different levels of context and encoding it as soft constraints during learning.

        Our approach is also semi-supervised. Compared to the existing work on semi-supervised learning for sentence-level sentiment classification
        [27, 28, 21]
        , our work does not rely on a large amount of coarse-grained (document-level) labeled data, instead, distant supervision mainly comes from linguistically-motivated constraints.

        [6, 1, 7, 5]
        . Most previous work using PR mainly experiments with feature-label constraints. In contrast, we explore a rich set of linguistically-motivated constraints which cannot be naturally formulated in the feature-label form. We also show that constraints derived from the discourse context can be highly useful for disambiguating sentence-level sentiment.

        In this section, we present the details of our proposed approach. We formulate the sentence-level sentiment classification task as a sequence labeling problem. The inputs to the model are sentence-segmented documents annotated with sentence-level sentiment labels (positive, negative or neutral) along with a set of unlabeled documents. During prediction, the model outputs sentiment labels for a sequence of sentences in the test document. We utilize conditional random fields and use Posterior Regularization (PR) to learn their parameters with a rich set of context-aware constraints.

         We develop a rich set of context-aware posterior constraints for sentence-level sentiment analysis by exploiting lexical and discourse knowledge. Specifically, we construct the lexical constraints by extracting sentiment-bearing patterns within sentences and construct the discourse-level constraints by extracting discourse relations that indicate sentiment coherence or sentiment changes both within and across sentences. Each constraint can be formulated as equality between the expectation of a constraint function value and a desired value set by prior knowledge. The equality is not strictly enforced (due to the regularization in the PR objective
         2
         ). Therefore all the constraints are applied as soft constraints. Table

         Lexical Patterns
         The existence of a polarity-carrying word alone may not correctly indicate the polarity of the sentence, as the polarity can be reversed by other polarity-reversing words. We extract lexical patterns that consist of polar words and negators
         , and apply the heuristics based on compositional semantics
         [2]
         to assign a sentiment value to each pattern.

         w
         with its sentiment value. Note that sentences with neutral sentiment can also contain such lexical patterns. Therefore we allow the lexical patterns to be assigned a neutral sentiment with a prior probability
         r0
         (we compute this value as the empirical probability of neutral sentiment in the training documents). Using the polarity indicated by lexical patterns to constrain the sentiment of sentences is quite aggressive. Therefore we only consider lexical patterns that are strongly discriminative (many opinion words in the lexicon only indicate sentiment with weak strength). The selected lexical patterns include a handful of seed patterns (such as “pros” and “cons”) and the lexical patterns that have high precision (larger then 0.9) of predicting sentiment in the training data.

         Discourse Connectives.
         Lexical patterns can be limited in capturing contextual information since they only look at interactions between words within an expression. To capture context at the clause or sentence level, we consider discourse connectives, which are cue phrases or words that indicate discourse relations between adjacent sentences or clauses. To identify discourse connectives, we apply a discourse tagger trained on the Penn Discourse Treebank
         [20]
         to our data. Discourse connectives are tagged with four senses:
         Expansion, Contingency, Comparison, Temporal

       <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.SS2.p5">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         Discourse connectives can operate at both intra-sentential and inter-sentential level. For example, the word “although” is often used to connect two polar clauses within a sentence, while the word “however” is often used to at the beginning of the sentence to connect two polar sentences. It is important to distinguish these two types of discourse connectives. We consider a discourse connective to be intra-sentential if it has the
         Comparison
         sense and connects two polar clauses with opposite polarities (determined by the lexical patterns). We construct a feature-label constraint for each intra-sentential discourse connective and set its expected sentiment value to be neutral.

         Unlike the intra-sentential discourse connectives, the inter-sentential discourse connectives can indicate sentiment transitions between sentences. Intuitively, discourse connectives with the senses of
         Expansion
         (e.g. also, for example, furthermore) and
         Contingency
         (e.g. as a result, hence, because) are likely to indicate sentiment coherence; discourse connectives with the sense of
         Comparison
         (e.g. but, however, nevertheless) are likely to indicate sentiment changes. This intuition is reasonable but it assumes the two sentences connected by the discourse connective are both polar sentences. In general, discourse connectives can also be used to connect non-polar (neutral) sentences. Thus it is hard to directly constrain the posterior expectation for each type of sentiment transitions using inter-sentential discourse connectives.

         Opinion Coreference
         Sentences in a discourse can be linked by many types of coherence relations

For example, the proportion of negative sentences in the positive documents is very small compared to the proportion of positive sentences. To encode this intuition, we define the following constraint function:

In particular, incorporating discourse constraints leads to consistent improvements to our model. This demonstrates that our modeling of discourse information is effective and that taking into account the discourse context is important for improving sentence-level sentiment analysis. We also compare our results to the previously published results on the same dataset. HCRF

         baseline provides very strong F1 scores on the positive and negative categories especially in the Books and Music domains, but very poor F1 on the neutral category. This is because it over-predicts the polar sentences in the polar documents, and predicts no polar sentences in the neutral documents. In contrast, our PR models provide more balanced F1 scores among all the sentiment categories. Compared to the CRF baseline and its variants, we found that the PR models can greatly improve the precision of predicting positive and negative sentences, resulting in a significant improvement on the positive/negative F1 scores. However, the improvement on the neutral category is modest. A plausible explanation is that most of our constraints focus on discriminating polar sentences. They can help reduce the errors of misclassifying polar sentences, but the model needs more constraints in order to distinguish neutral sentences from polar sentences. We plan to address this issue in future work.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         We analyze the errors to better understand the merits and limitations of the PR model. We found that the PR model is able to correct many CRF errors caused by the lack of labeled data. The first row in Table
         5
         shows an example of such errors. The lexical features
         return
         and
         exchange
         may be good indicators of negative sentiment for the sentence. However, with limited labeled data, the CRF learner can only associate very weak sentiment signals to these features. In contrast, the PR model is able to associate stronger sentiment signals to these features by leveraging unlabeled data for indirect supervision. A simple lexicon-based constraint during inference time may also correct this case. However, hard-constraint baselines can hardly improve the performance in general because the contributions of different constraints are not learned and their combination may not lead to better predictions. This is also demonstrated by the limited performance of
         CRF-inf
         in our experiments.

         We also found that the discourse constraints play an important role in improving the sentiment prediction. The lexical constraints alone are often not sufficient since their coverage is limited by the sentiment lexicon and they can only constrain sentiment locally. On the contrary, discourse constraints are not dependent on sentiment lexicons, and more importantly, they can provide sentiment preferences on multiple sentences at the same time. When combining discourse constraints with features from different sentences, the PR model becomes more powerful in disambiguating sentiment. The second example in Table
         5
         shows that the PR model learned with discourse constraints correctly predicts the sentiment of two sentences where no lexical constraints apply.

         However, discourse constraints are not always helpful. One reason is that they do not constrain the neutral sentiment. As a result they could not help disambiguate neutral sentiment from polar sentiment, such as the third example in Table
         5
         . This is also a problem for most of our lexical constraints. In general, it is hard to learn reliable indicators for the neutral sentiment. In the MD dataset, a neutral label may be given because the sentence contains mixed sentiment or no sentiment or it is off-topic. We plan to explore more refined constraints that can deal with the neutral sentiment in future work. Another limitation of the discourse constraints is that they could be affected by the errors of the discourse parser and the coreference resolver. A potential way to address this issue is to learn discourse constraints jointly with sentiment. We plan to study this in future research.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for learning sentence-level sentiment. Our approach incorporates intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints while training a conditional random field model via posterior regularization. We explore a rich set of context-aware constraints at both intra- and inter-sentential levels, and demonstrate their effectiveness in the analysis of sentence-level sentiment. While we focus on the sentence-level task, our approach can be easily extended to handle sentiment analysis at finer levels of granularity. Our experiments show that our model achieves better accuracy than existing supervised and semi-supervised models for the sentence-level sentiment classification task.
