       Introduction
      </h2>

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Recent advances in computer vision and natural language processing have led to
an upsurge of research on tasks involving both vision and language. State of
the art visual detectors have made it possible to hypothesise
        what
        is in
an image
        [6, 5]
        , paving the way for automatic
image description systems. The aim of such systems is to extract and reason
about visual aspects of images to generate a human-like description. An example
of the type of image and gold-standard descriptions available can be seen in
Figure
        1
        . Recent approaches to this task have been based on
slot-filling
        [17, 3]
        , combining web-scale n-grams
        [11]
        , syntactic tree substitution
        [12]
        , and
description-by-retrieval
        [4, 14, 7]
        . Image
description has been compared to translating an image into text
        [11, 9]
        or summarising an image
        [17]
        , resulting
in the adoption of the evaluation measures from those communities.

        In this paper we estimate the correlation of human judgements with five
automatic evaluation measures on two image description data sets. Our work
extends previous studies of evaluation measures for image description
        [7]
        , which focused on unigram-based measures and reported
agreement scores such as Cohen’s
        κ
        rather than correlations. The main
finding of our analysis is that
        ter
        and unigram
        bleu
        are weakly
correlated against human judgements,
        rouge-su4
        and Smoothed
        bleu
        are moderately correlated, and the strongest correlation is found with Meteor.

       Methodology

       <p class="ltx_p">
        We estimate Spearman’s
        ρ
        for five different
automatic evaluation measures against human judgements for the automatic image
description task.
Spearman’s
        ρ
        is a non-parametric correlation co-efficient that restricts
the ability of outlier data points to skew the co-efficient value.
The automatic measures are calculated on the sentence level and correlated
against human judgements of semantic correctness.

         The test data of the Flickr8K data set contains 1,000 images paired with five
reference descriptions. The images were retrieved from Flickr, the reference
descriptions were collected from Mechanical Turk, and the human judgements were
collected from expert annotators as follows: each image in the test data was
paired with the highest scoring sentence(s) retrieved from all possible test
sentences by the
         tri5sem
         model in
         Hodosh et al. (2013)

image–description pairing in the test data was judged for semantic correctness
by three expert human judges on a scale of 1–4. We calculate automatic

descriptions for the original image.

Turk, and the judgements were also collected from Mechanical Turk.
         Elliott and Keller (2013)
         generated two-sentence descriptions for each of the test
images using four variants of a slot-filling model, and collected five human
judgements of the semantic correctness and grammatical correctness of the
description on a scale of 1–5 for each image–description pair, resulting in a
total of 2,042 human judgement–description pairings. In this analysis, we use
only the first sentence of the description, which describes the event depicted
in the image.

         Meteor is the harmonic mean of unigram precision and recall that allows for
exact, synonym, and paraphrase matchings between candidates and references. It
is calculated by generating an alignment between the tokens in the candidate
and reference sentences, with the aim of a 1:1 alignment between
tokens and minimising the number of chunks
         ch
         of contiguous and
identically ordered tokens in the sentence pair. The alignment is based on
exact token matching, followed by Wordnet synonyms, and then stemmed tokens.
We can calculate precision, recall, and F-measure, where

of aligned unigrams between candidate and reference. Meteor is defined as:

        is also only weakly correlated against human judgements, even though it
has been reported extensively for this task. Figure
        2
        (a)
shows an almost uniform distribution of unigram
        bleu
        scores, regardless
of the human judgement. Smoothed
        bleu
        and
        rouge-su4
        are moderately
correlated with human judgements, and the correlation is stronger than with
unigram
        bleu
        . Finally, Meteor is most strongly correlated measure
against human judgements.
A similar pattern is observed in the
        Elliott and Keller (2013)
        data set,
though the correlations are lower across all measures. This could be
caused by the smaller sample size or because the descriptions were
generated by a computer, and not retrieved from a collection of
human-written descriptions containing the gold-standard text, as in the
Flickr8K data set.

         Figure
         3
         shows two images from the test collection of the
Flickr8K data set with a low Meteor score and a maximum human judgement of
semantic correctness. The main difference between the candidates and references
are in deciding
         what
         to describe (content selection), and
         how
         to
describe it (realisation). We can hypothesise that in both translation and
summarisation, the source text acts as a lexical and semantic framework within
which the translation or summarisation process takes place. In
Figure
         3
         (a), the authors of the descriptions made different
decisions on
         what
         to describe. A decision has been made to describe the
role of the officials in the candidate text, and not in the reference text.
The underlying cause of this is an active area of research in the human vision
literature and can be attributed to bottom-up effects, such as saliency
         [8]
         , top-down contextual effects
         [16]
         , or
rapidly-obtained scene properties
         [13]
         . In (b), we can see the
problem of deciding how to describe the selected content. The reference uses a
more specific noun to describe the person on the bicycle than the candidate.

       Discussion
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        There are several differences between our analysis and that of
        Hodosh et al. (2013)
        . First, we report Spearman’s
        ρ
        correlation
coefficient of automatic measures against human judgements, whereas they report
agreement between judgements and automatic measures in terms of Cohen’s
        κ
        . The use of
        κ
        requires the transformation of real-valued
scores into categorical values, and thus loses information; we use the
judgement and evaluation measure scores in their original forms. Second, our
use of Spearman’s
        ρ
        means we can readily use all of the available data for
the correlation analysis, whereas
        Hodosh et al. (2013)
        report agreement on
thresholded subsets of the data. Third, we report the correlation coefficients
against five evaluation measures, some of which go beyond unigram matchings
between references and candidates, whereas they only report unigram
        bleu
        and unigram
        rouge
        . It is therefore difficult to directly compare the
results of our correlation analysis against Hodosh et al.’s agreement analysis,
but they also reach the conclusion that unigram
        bleu
        is not an
appropriate measure of image description performance. However, we do find
stronger correlations with Smoothed
        bleu
        , skip-bigram
        rouge
        , and
Meteor.

        In contrast to the results presented here,
        Reiter and Belz (2009)
        found no
significant correlations of automatic evaluation measures against human
judgements of the
        accuracy
        of machine-generated weather forecasts. They
did, however, find significant correlations of automatic measures against
        fluency
        judgements. There are no fluency judgements available for Flickr8K,
but
        Elliott and Keller (2013)
        report grammaticality judgements for their data,
which are comparable to fluency ratings. We failed to find significant
correlations between grammatlicality judgements and any of the automatic
measures on the
        Elliott and Keller (2013)
        data. This discrepancy could be explained
in terms of the differences between the weather forecast generation and image
description tasks, or because the image description data sets contain thousands
of texts and a few human judgements per text, whereas the data sets of
        Reiter and Belz (2009)
        included hundreds of texts with 30 human judges.

       Conclusions
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        In this paper we performed a sentence-level correlation analysis of automatic
evaluation measures against expert human judgements for the automatic image
description task. We found that sentence-level unigram
        bleu
        is only weakly
correlated with human judgements, even though it has extensively reported in
the literature for this task. Meteor was found to have the highest correlation
with human judgements, but it requires Wordnet and paraphrase resources that
are not available for all languages. Our findings held when judgements were
made on human-written or computer-generated descriptions.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        The variability in what and how people describe images will cause problems for
all of the measures compared in this paper. Nevertheless, we propose
that unigram
        bleu
        should no longer be used as an objective function for
automatic image description because it has a weak correlation with human
accuracy judgements. We recommend adopting either Meteor, Smoothed
        bleu
        ,
or
        rouge-su4
        because they show stronger correlations with human
judgements. We believe these suggestions are also applicable to the ranking
tasks proposed in
        Hodosh et al. (2013)
        , where automatic evaluation scores could
act as features to a ranking function.
