       Introduction

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Analysing and extracting useful information from the web has become an increasingly important research direction for the NLP community, where many tasks require part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a fundamental preprocessing step.
However, state-of-the-art POS taggers in the literature
        [5, 23]
        are mainly optimized on the the Penn Treebank (PTB), and when shifted to web data, tagging accuracies drop significantly
        [18]
        .

       <p class="ltx_p">
        The problem we face here can be considered as a special case of
        domain adaptation
        , where we have access to labelled data on the source domain (PTB) and unlabelled data on the target domain (web data). Exploiting useful information from the web data can be the key to improving web domain tagging.
Towards this end, we adopt the idea of learning representations which has been demonstrated useful in capturing hidden regularities underlying the raw input data (web text, in our case).

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Our approach consists of two phrases. In the pre-training phase, we learn an encoder that converts the web text into an intermediate representation, which acts as useful features for prediction tasks.
We integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging
        [21, 5]
        in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy-first POS tagger.
We choose the easy-first tagging approach since it has been demonstrated to give higher accuracies than the standard left-to-right POS tagger
        [23, 15]
        .

        In the fine-tuning phase, the parameters of the network are optimized on a set of labelled training data using guided learning.
The learned model preserves the property of preferring to tag
        easy
        words first.
To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate guided learning for neural networks.

        The idea of learning representations from unlabelled data and then fine-tuning a model with such representations according to some supervised criterion has been studied before
        [26, 6, 8]
        . While most previous work focus on in-domain sequential labelling or cross-domain classification tasks, we are the first to learn representations for web-domain structured prediction.
Previous work treats the learned representations either as model parameters that are further optimized in supervised fine-tuning
        [6]
        or as fixed features that are kept unchanged
        [26, 8]
        .
In this work, we investigate both strategies and give empirical comparisons in the cross-domain setting.
Our results suggest that while both strategies improve in-domain tagging accuracies, keeping the learned representation unchanged consistently results in better cross-domain accuracies.

       Learning from Web Text

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Unsupervised learning is often used for training encoders that convert the input data to abstract representations (i.e. encoding vectors).
Such representations capture hidden properties of the input, and can be used as features for supervised tasks
        [3, 20]
        .
Among the many proposed encoders, we choose the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which has been successfully used in many tasks
        [14, 10]
        .
In this section, we give some background on RBMs and then show how they can be used to learn representations of the web text.

         Most of the indicative features for POS disambiguation can be found from the words and word combinations within a local context
         [21, 5]
         .
Inspired by this observation, we apply the RBM to learn feature representations from word n-grams.
More specifically, given the
         it⁢h
         word
         wi
         of a sentence, we apply RBMs to model the joint distribution of the n-gram

         , where
         l
         and
         r
         denote the left and right window, respectively.
Note that the visible units of RBMs are binary. While in our case, each visible variable corresponds to a word, which may take on tens-of-thousands of different values.
Therefore, the RBM need to be re-factorized to make inference tractable.

By adopting greedy layer-wise training
         [10, 2]
         , DBNs are capable of modelling higher order non-linear relations between the input, and has been demonstrated to improve performance for many computer vision tasks

However, in this work we do not observe further improvement by employing DBNs.
This may partly be due to the fact that unlike computer vision tasks, the input structure of POS tagging or other sequential labelling tasks is relatively simple, and a single non-linear layer is enough to model the interactions within the input

         Φ⁢(x)=(f1⁢(x),…,fk⁢(x))
         , where
         x
         denotes the partially tagged input sentence and
         fi⁢(x)
         denotes a feature function, which returns 1 if the corresponding feature fires and 0 otherwise.
The first layer of this module is a linear transformation layer, which converts the high dimensional sparse vector into a fixed-dimensional real value vector:
        </p>
        𝐨s=𝐌s⁢Φ⁢(x)+𝐛s

(13)
        <p class="ltx_p">
         Depending on the specific task being considered, the output of this layer can be further fed to other non-linear layers, such as a sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent layer, to model more complex relations.
For POS tagging, we found that a simple linear layer yields satisfactory accuracies.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         The web-feature and sparse-feature modules are combined by a linear output layer, as shown in the upper part of Figure 1.
The value of each unit in this layer denotes the score of the corresponding POS tag.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         In some circumstances, probability distribution over POS tags might be a more preferable form of output.
Such distribution can be easily obtained by adding a soft-max layer on top of the output layer to perform a local normalization, as done by
         Collobert et al. (2011)
         .

Rather than tagging a sentence from left to right, easy-first tagging is based on a deterministic process, repeatedly selecting the

Here “easiness” is evaluated based on a statistical model.

While previous work

         apply guided learning to train a linear classifier by using variants of the perceptron algorithm, we are the first to combine guided learning with a neural network, by using a margin loss and a modified back-propagation algorithm.

         Our experiments are conducted on the data set provided by the SANCL 2012 shared task, which aims at building a single robust syntactic analysis system across the web-domain.
The data set consists of labelled data for both the source (Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank) and target (web) domains.
The web domain data can be further classified into five sub-domains, including emails, weblogs, business reviews, news groups and Yahoo!Answers.
While emails and weblogs are used as the development sets, reviews, news groups and Yahoo!Answers are used as the final test sets.
Participants are not allowed to use web-domain labelled data for training.
In addition to labelled data, a large amount of unlabelled data on the web domain is also provided.
Statistics about labelled and unlabelled data are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

The neural network of our baseline tagger only contains the sparse-feature module.

        Exploring the Learned Knowledge
       </h3>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS3.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         As mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally,
using
         word representation
         , which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM,
or
         ngram-level representation
         , which corresponds to initializing both the projection and sigmoid layers of the web-feature module by the learned WRRBM.
In each case, there can be two different
         training strategies
         depending on whether the learned representations are further adjusted or kept unchanged during the fine-turning phrase.
Experimental results under the 4 combined settings on the development sets are illustrated in Figure 2, 3 and 4, where the x-axis denotes the size of the training data and y-axis denotes tagging accuracy.

         Effect of the Training Strategy

         <p class="ltx_p">
          From Figure 2 we can see that when knowledge from the pre-trained WRRBM is incorporated, both the
          training strategies
          (“word-fixed” vs “word-adjusted”, “ngram-fixed” vs “ngram-adjusted”) improve accuracies on the source domain, which is consistent with previous findings (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011).
In addition, adjusting the learned representation or keeping them fixed does not result in too much difference in tagging accuracies.

         <p class="ltx_p">
          On the web-domain data, shown in Figure 3 and 4, we found that leaving the learned representation unchanged (“word-fixed”, “ngram-fixed”) yields consistently higher performance gains.
This result is to some degree expected.
Intuitively, unsupervised pre-training moves the parameters of the WRRBM towards the region where properties of the
          web domain
          data are properly modelled.
However, since fine-tuning is conducted with respect to the
          source domain
          , adjusting the parameters of the pre-trained representation towards optimizing source domain tagging accuracies would disrupt its ability in modelling the web domain data.
Therefore, a better idea is to keep the representation unchanged so that we can learn a function that maps the general web-text properties to its syntactic categories.

          From Figures 2, 3 and 4, we can see that adopting the ngram-level representation consistently achieves better performance compared with using word representations only (“word-fixed” vs “ngram-fixed”, “word-adjusted” vs “ngram-adjusted”).
This result illustrates that the ngram-level knowledge captures more complex interactions of the web text, which cannot be recovered by using only word embeddings.
Similar result was reported by Dahl et al. (2012), who found that using both the word embeddings and the hidden units of a tri-gram WRRBM as additional features for a CRF chunker yields larger improvements than using word embeddings only.

          Finally, more detailed accuracies under the 4 settings on the email domain are shown in Table 4.

By contrast, using n-gram representations improves the performance on both oov and non-oov.

Tagging performance and lexicon coverages of each data set on the development sets are shown in Table 5.
We can see that using the target domain data achieves similar improvements compared with using the mixed data.
However, for the email domain, RBM-W yields much smaller improvement compared with RBM-E, and vice versa.
From the lexicon coverages, we can see that the sub-domains varies significantly.
The results suggest that using mixed data can achieve almost as good performance as using the target sub-domain data, while using mixed data yields a much more robust tagger across all sub-domains.

        Their work differs from ours in that their approaches learn representations from the feature vectors for sentiment classification, which might be of thousands of dimensions.
Such high dimensional input gives rise to high computational cost and it is not clear whether those approaches can be applied to large scale unlabelled data, with hundreds of millions of training examples.
Our method learns representations from only word n-grams with
        n

The idea is to project the original feature representations into low dimensional representations, which yields a high-accuracy classifier on the target domain.
The new representations are induced based on the auxiliary tasks defined on unlabelled data together with a dimensionality reduction technique.
Such auxiliary tasks can be specific to the supervised task.
As pointed out by

        Regarding using neural networks for sequential labelling, our approach shares similarity with that of

In particular, we both use a non-linear layer to model complex relations underling word embeddings.
However, our network differs from theirs in the following aspects.

        model the dependency between neighbouring tags in a generative manner, by employing a transition score

Our model captures such a dependency in a discriminative manner, by just adding tag-related features to the sparse-feature module.
