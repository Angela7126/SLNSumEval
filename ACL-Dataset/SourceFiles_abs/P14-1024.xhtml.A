        Lakoff and Johnson (1980)
        characterize metaphor as reasoning about one thing in terms of another,
i.e., a metaphor is a type of
        conceptual mapping
        ,
where words or phrases are applied to objects and actions
in ways that do not permit a literal interpretation.
They argue that metaphors play a fundamental communicative role in verbal and written interactions, claiming that much of our everyday language is delivered in metaphorical terms.
There is empirical evidence supporting the claim: recent corpus studies have estimated that the proportion of words used metaphorically ranges from 5% to 20%
        [33]
        , and
        Thibodeau and Boroditsky (2011)
        provide evidence that a choice of metaphors affects decision making.

        Given the prevalence and importance of metaphoric language, effective automatic detection of metaphors would have a number of benefits, both practical and scientific. Language processing applications that need to understand language or preserve meaning (information extraction, machine translation, dialog systems, sentiment analysis, and text analytics, etc.) would have access to a potentially useful high-level bit of information about whether something is to be understood literally or not. Second, scientific hypotheses about metaphoric language could be tested more easily at a larger scale with automation.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        However, metaphor detection is a hard problem.
On one hand, there is a subjective component: humans may disagree
whether a particular expression is used metaphorically or not, as there is no clear-cut semantic distinction between figurative and metaphorical language
        [32]
        .
On the other, metaphors can be domain- and context-dependent.

        Previous work has focused on metaphor identification in English, using both extensive manually-created linguistic resources
        [20, 10, 16, 40, 4]
        and corpus-based approaches
        [2, 30, 24, 29, 12]
        . We build on this foundation and also extend metaphor detection into other languages in which few resources may exist.
Our work makes the following contributions: (1) we develop a new state-of-the-art English metaphor detection system that uses
        conceptual
        semantic features, such as a degree of abstractness and semantic supersenses;
        (2) we create new metaphor-annotated corpora for Russian and English;
        (3) using a paradigm of model transfer
        [21, 41, 15]
        , we provide support for the hypothesis that metaphors are conceptual (rather than lexical) in nature by showing that our English-trained model can detect metaphors in Spanish, Farsi, and Russian.

       Methodology
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Our task in this work is to define features that distinguish between metaphoric and literal uses of two syntactic constructions: subject-verb-object (SVO) and adjective-noun (AN) tuples.
        We give examples of a prototypical metaphoric usage of each type:

           SVO metaphors.
           A sentence containing a metaphoric SVO relation is
           my car drinks gasoline
           .
According to Wilks
           [42]
           ,
this metaphor represents a violation of selectional preferences for the verb
           drink
           ,
which is normally associated with animate subjects (the car is inanimate and, hence,
cannot drink in the literal sense of the verb).

           AN metaphors.
           The phrase
           broken promise
           is an AN metaphor,
where attributes from a concrete domain (associated with the concrete word
           broken
           )
are transferred to a more abstract domain, which
is represented by the relatively abstract word
           promise
           .
That is, we map an abstract concept
           promise
           to
a concrete domain of physical things, where things can be literally broken to pieces.

        Motivated by Lakoff‚Äôs (1980) argument that metaphors are systematic conceptual mappings, we will use coarse-grained
        conceptual
        , rather than fine-grained
        lexical
        features, in our classifier.
Conceptual features pertain to concepts and ideas as opposed to individual words or phrases expressed in a particular language. In this sense, as long as two words in two different languages refer to the same concepts, their conceptual features should be the same.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that our coarse semantic features give us a language-invariant representation suitable for metaphor detection. To test this hypothesis, we use a cross-lingual model transfer approach: we use bilingual dictionaries to project words from other syntactic constructions found in other languages into English and then apply the English model on the derived conceptual representations.

        Each SVO (or AN) instance will be represented by a triple (duple) from which a feature vector will be extracted.
        The vector will consist of the concatenation of the conceptual features (which we discuss below) for all participating words, and conjunction features for word pairs.
        For example, to generate the feature vector for the SVO triple
        (ùëêùëéùëü,ùëëùëüùëñùëõùëò,ùëîùëéùë†ùëúùëôùëñùëõùëí)

        drink
        ,
        gasoline

        We define three main feature categories (1) abstractness and imageability, (2) supersenses, (3) unsupervised vector-space word representations;
each category corresponds to a group of features with a common theme and representation.

           Abstractness and imageability.
           Abstractness and imageability were shown to be useful in detection of metaphors (it is easier to invoke mental pictures of concrete and imageable words)
           [40, 4]
           . We expect that abstractness, used in conjunction features (e.g., a feature denoting that the subject is abstract and the verb is concrete), is especially useful: semantically, an abstract agent performing a concrete action is a strong signal of metaphorical usage.

          <p class="ltx_p">
           Although often correlated with abstractness, imageability is not a redundant property. While most abstract things are hard to visualize, some call up images, e.g.,
           vengeance
           calls up an emotional image,
           torture
           calls up emotions and even visual images. There are concrete things that are hard to visualize too, for example,
           abbey
           is harder to visualize than
           banana

           Supersenses.
           Supersenses
           are coarse semantic categories originating in WordNet. For nouns and verbs there are 45 classes: 26 for nouns and 15 for verbs, for example,
           noun.body
           ,
           noun.animal
           ,
           verb.consumption
           , or
           verb.motion
           [5]
           . English adjectives do not, as yet, have a similar high-level semantic partitioning in WordNet, thus we use a 13-class taxonomy of adjective supersenses constructed by
           Tsvetkov et al. (2014)
           (discussed in ¬ß
           3.2
           ).

         <div class="ltx_para" id="I2.i2.p2">
          <p class="ltx_p">
           Supersenses are particularly attractive features for metaphor detection: coarse sense taxonomies can be viewed as semantic concepts, and since concept mapping is a process in which metaphors are born, we expect different supersense co-occurrences in metaphoric and literal combinations. In ‚Äúdrinks gasoline‚Äù, for example, mapping to supersenses would yield a pair
           &lt;
           verb.consumption, noun.substance&gt;
           , contrasted with
           &lt;
           verb.consumption, noun.food&gt;
           for ‚Äúdrinks juice‚Äù. In addition, this coarse semantic categorization is preserved in translation
           [27]
           , which makes supersense features suitable for cross-lingual approaches such as ours.

           Vector space word representations.
           Vector space word representations learned using unsupervised algorithms are often effective features in supervised learning methods
           [39]
           . In particular, many such representations are designed to capture lexical semantic properties and are quite effective features in semantic processing, including named entity recognition
           [38]
           , word sense disambiguation
           [13]
           , and lexical entailment
           [1]
           . In a recent study,
           Mikolov et al. (2013)
           reveal an interesting cross-lingual property of distributed word representations: there is a strong similarity between the vector spaces across languages that can be easily captured by linear mapping. Thus, vector space models can also be seen as vectors of (latent) semantic concepts, that preserve their ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù across languages.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         To make classification decisions, we use a random forest classifier
         [3]
         ,
an ensemble of decision tree classifiers learned from many independent subsamples of the training data.
Given an input, each tree classifier assigns a probability to each label;
those probabilities are averaged to compute the probability distribution across the ensemble.
Random forest ensembles are particularly suitable for our resource-scarce scenario:
rather than overfitting, they produce a limiting value of the generalization error
as the number of trees increases,
         and no hyperparameter tuning is required.
In addition, decision-tree classifiers learn non-linear responses to inputs and often outperform logistic regression
         [26]
         .
         Our random forest classifier models the probability that the input syntactic relation is metaphorical.
If this probability is above a threshold, the relation is classified as metaphoric, otherwise it is literal.
We used the
         scikit-learn
         toolkit to train our classifiers

Similarly to
          Tsvetkov et al. (2013)

vector space representations.
More specifically, we calculate the degree of abstractness and imageability of all English items
that have a vector space representation, using vector elements as features.
We train two separate classifiers for abstractness and imageability on a seed set of words from the MRC database.
Degrees of abstractness and imageability are posterior probabilities of classifier predictions. We binarize these posteriors into abstract-concrete (or imageable-unimageable) boolean indicators using pre-defined thresholds.
          Performance of these classifiers, tested on a sampled held-out data, is 0.94 and 0.85 for the abstractness and imageability classifiers, respectively.

          WordNet lacks coarse-grained semantic categories for adjectives.
To divide adjectives into groups,
          Tsvetkov et al. (2014)
          use 13 top-level classes from the adapted taxonomy of
          Hundsnurscher and Splett (1982)
          ,
which is incorporated in GermaNet
          [11]

For example, the top-level classes in GermaNet include:

          (e.g., willing, pleasant, cheerful);
          adj.substance
          (e.g., dry, ripe, creamy);
          adj.spatial
          (e.g., adjacent, gigantic).
          For each adjective type in WordNet, they produce a vector with a classifier posterior probabilities
corresponding to degrees of membership of this word in one of the 13 semantic classes,
          similar to the feature vectors we build for nouns and verbs. For example, for a word
          calm

        <p class="ltx_p">
         For languages other than English, feature vectors are projected to English features using translation dictionaries.
We used the Babylon dictionary,
         which is a proprietary resource, but any bilingual dictionary can in principle be used.
For a non-English word in a source language,
we first obtain all translations into English.
Then, we average all feature vectors related to these translations.
Consider an example related to projection of WordNet supersenses.
A Russian word
         –≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞
         is translated as
         head
         and
         brain

Hence, we select all the synsets of the nouns
         head
         and
         brain

         head
         and 5 for
         brain

Then, we filter extracted relations to eliminate parsing-related errors, and relations with verbs which are not in the TroFi verb list. After filtering, there are 953 metaphorical and 656 literal SVO relations which we use as a training set.

         Our task, as defined in Section
         2
         , is to classify SVO and AN relations as either metaphoric or literal. We first conduct a 10-fold cross-validation experiment on the training set defined in Section
         4.1
         . We represent each candidate relation using the features described in Section
         3.2
         , and evaluate performance of the three feature categories and their combinations.
This is done by computing an accuracy in the 10-fold cross validation.
Experimental results are given in Table
         2
         ,
where we also provide the number of features in each feature set.
        </p>

         These results show superior performance over previous state-of-the-art results, confirming our hypothesis that conceptual features are effective in metaphor classification. For the SVO task, the cross-validation accuracy is about 10% better than
that of
         Tsvetkov et al. (2013)
         .
For the AN task, the cross validation accuracy is better by 8% than the result of
         Turney et al. (2011)
         (two baseline methods are described in Section
         5.2
         ).
We can see that all types of features have good performance on their own (VSM is the strongest feature type). Noun supersense features alone allows us to achieve an accuracy of 75%, i.e., adjective supersense features contribute 4% to adjective-noun supersense feature combination.
Experiments with the pairs of features yield better results than individual features, implying that the feature categories are not redundant. Yet, combining all features leads to even higher accuracy during cross-validation.
In the case of the AN task,
a difference between the All feature combination and any other combination of features listed in Table
         2
         is statistically significant (
         p&lt;0.01
         for both the sign and the permutation test).

         Although the first experiment shows very high scores, the 10-fold cross-validation cannot fully reflect the generality of the model, because all folds are parts of the same corpus.
They are collected by the same human judges and belong to the same domain.
Therefore, experiments on out-of-domain data are crucial.
We carry out such experiments using held-out SVO and AN
         en
         test sets, described in Section
         4.2
         and Table
         1
         . In this experiment, we measure the
         f
         -score. We classify SVO and AN relations using a classifier trained on the All feature combination and balanced thresholds. The values of the
         f
         -score are 0.76, both for SVO and AN tasks.
This out-of-domain experiment suggests that our classifier is portable across domains and genres.

         However, (1) different application may have different requirements for recall/precision,
and (2) classification results may be skewed towards having high precision and low recall (or vice versa).
It is possible to trade precision for recall by choosing a different threshold.
Thus, in addition to giving a single
         f
         -score value for balanced thresholds,
we present a Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve,
where we plot a fraction of true positives against the fraction of false positives
for 100 threshold values in the range from zero to one.
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) can be interpreted as the probability
that a classifier will assign a higher score to a randomly chosen positive example than to a randomly chosen negative example.
         For a randomly guessing classifier, the ROC curve is a dashed diagonal line.
A bad classifier has an ROC curve that goes close to the dashed diagonal or even below it.

all three feature sets are effective, both for SVO and for AN tasks.
Abstractness and Imageability features work better for adjectives and nouns,
which is in line with previous findings
         [40, 4]
         .
It can be also seen that VSM features are very effective.
This is in line with results of

         Manual data analysis on adjective-noun pairs supports an abstractness-concreteness hypothesis formulated by several independent research studies. For example, in English we classify as metaphoric
         dirty word

         cloudy future
         . Word pairs
         dirty diaper

         have same adjectives. Yet they are classified as literal. Indeed,
         diaper
         is a more concrete term than
         word
         and
         weather
         is more concrete than
         future
         . Same pattern is observed in non-English datasets. In Russian,
         –±–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ
         ‚Äúsick society‚Äù and

Spanish example of an adjective-noun metaphor is a well-known

        describe a Concrete Category Overlap algorithm,
where co-occurrence statistics and Turney‚Äôs abstractness scores are used to determine
WordNet supersenses that correspond to literal usage of a given adjective or verb.
For example, given an adjective,
we can learn that it modifies
concrete nouns that usually have the supersense
        noun.body
        .
If this adjective modifies a noun with the supersense
        noun.feeling
        ,
we conclude that a metaphor is found.

        Broadwell et al. (2013)
        argue that
metaphors are highly imageable words that do not belong to a discussion topic.
To implement this idea, they extend MRC imageability scores to all dictionary words
using links among WordNet supersenses (mostly hypernym and hyponym relations).
        Strzalkowski et al. (2013)
        carry out
experiments in a specific (government-related) domain
for four languages: English, Spanish, Farsi, and Russian.
        Strzalkowski et al. (2013)
        explain the algorithm only for English
and say that is the same for Spanish, Farsi, and Russian.
Because they heavily rely on WordNet and availability of imageability scores,
their approach may not be applicable to low-resource languages.

        Hovy et al. (2013)
        applied tree kernels to metaphor detection.
Their method also employs WordNet supersenses,
but it is not clear from the description whether WordNet is essential or can be replaced
with some other lexical resource.
We cannot compare directly our model with this work because our classifier is restricted to detection of only SVO and AN metaphors.

        Tsvetkov et al. (2013)

method that uses only English lexical resources and a dependency parser.
Their study focuses only on the verb-based metaphors.
        Tsvetkov et al. (2013)
        employ only English and Russian data.
Current work builds on this study, and incorporates new syntactic relations as metaphor candidates, adds several new feature sets and different, more reliable datasets for evaluating results. We demonstrate results on two new languages, Spanish and Farsi, to emphasize the generality of the method.

        A words sense disambiguation (WSD) is a related problem, where one identifies meanings of polysemous words.
The difference is that in the WSD task, we need to select an already existing sense,
while for the metaphor detection, the goal is to identify cases of sense borrowing.
Studies showed that cross-lingual evidence allows one to achieve a state-of-the-art
performance in the WSD task, yet, most cross-lingual WSD methods employ parallel corpora

       <p class="ltx_p">
        The key contribution of our work is that
we show how to identify metaphors across languages by building a model in English
and applying it‚Äîwithout adaptation‚Äîto other languages: Spanish, Farsi, and Russian.
This model uses language-independent (rather than lexical or language specific) conceptual features.
Not only do we establish benchmarks for Spanish, Farsi, and Russian,
but we also achieve state-of-the-art performance in English.
In addition, we present a comparison of relative contributions of several types of features.
We concentrate on metaphors in the context
of two kinds of syntactic relations: subject-verb-object (SVO) relations and adjective-noun (AN) relations,
which account for a majority of all metaphorical phrases.

        Future work will expand the scope of metaphor identification by including nominal metaphoric relations as well as explore techniques for incorporating contextual features, which can play a key role in identifying certain kinds of metaphors. Second, cross-lingual model transfer can be improved with more careful cross-lingual feature projection.
