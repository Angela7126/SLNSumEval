       Introduction

        Suppose someone wants to tell their friend that they saw a dog chasing a cat. Given such a
        communicative goal
        , most people can formulate a sentence that satisfies the goal very
quickly. Further, they can easily provide multiple similar sentences,
differing in details but all satisfying the general communicative goal, with
no or very little error. Natural language generation (NLG) develops
techniques to extend similar capabilities to automated systems. In
this paper, we study the restricted NLG problem: given a
grammar, lexicon, world and a communicative goal, output a valid English
sentence that satisfies this goal. The problem is restricted because
in our work, we do not consider the issue of how to fragment a complex goal into
multiple sentences (discourse planning).
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Though restricted, this NLG problem is still difficult. A key source of difficulty is
the nature of the grammar, which is generally large, probabilistic and
ambiguous. Some NLG techniques use sampling
strategies
        [8]
        where a set of sentences is
sampled from a data structure created from an underlying grammar and
ranked according to how well they meet the communicative
goal.
Such approaches naturally handle statistical grammars, but do not solve the
generation problem in a goal-directed manner. Other approaches
view NLG as a
        planning
        problem
        [10]
        . Here, the communicative goal is
treated as a predicate to be satisfied, and the grammar and vocabulary
are suitably encoded as logical operators. Then automated classical planning
techniques are used to derive a plan which is converted into a
sentence. This is an elegant formalization of NLG, however,
restrictions on what current planning techniques can do limit its
applicability. A key limitation is the logical nature of automated
planning systems, which do not handle probabilistic grammars, or force
ad-hoc approaches for doing so
        [1]
        . A second
limitation comes from restrictions on the goal: it may be difficult to
ensure that some specific piece of information should
        not
        be
communicated, or to specify preferences over communicative goals, or
specify general conditions, like that the sentence should be readable
by a sixth grader. A third limitation comes from the search process:
without strong heuristics, most planners get bogged down when given
communicative goals that require chaining together long sequences of
operators
        [11]
        .

       <p class="ltx_p">
        In our work, we also view NLG as a planning problem. However, we
differ in that our underlying formalism for NLG is a suitably defined
        Markov
decision process
        (MDP). This setting allows us to address the
limitations outlined above: it is naturally probabilistic, and handles
probabilistic grammars; we are able to specify complex communicative
goals and general criteria through a suitably-defined reward function;
and, as we show in our experiments, recent developments in fast
planning in large MDPs result in a generation system that can rapidly
deal with very specific communicative goals. Further, our system has
several other desirable properties: it is an anytime approach; with a
probabilistic grammar, it can naturally be used to sample and generate
multiple sentences satisfying the communicative goal; and it is
robust to large grammar sizes. Finally, the decision-theoretic setting allows for a
precise tradeoff between exploration of the grammar and vocabulary to
find a better solution and exploitation of the current most promising
(partial) solution, instead of a heuristic search through the solution
space as performed by standard planning approaches.

evaluate our approach and a state-of-the-art
baseline in several different experimental settings and demonstrate

       Related Work

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Two broad lines of
approaches have been used to attack the general NLG problem. One
direction can be thought of as “overgeneration and ranking.” Here
some (possibly probabilistic) structure is used to generate multiple
candidate sentences, which are then ranked according to how well they
satisfy the generation criteria. This includes work based on chart
generation and
parsing
        [17, 6]
        . These generators
assign semantic meaning to each individual token, then use a set of
rules to decide if two words can be combined. Any combination which
contains a semantic representation equivalent to the input at the
conclusion of the algorithm is a valid output from a chart generation
system. Other examples of this idea are the HALogen/Nitrogen
systems
        [12]
        . HALogen uses a two-phase
architecture where first, a “forest” data structure that compactly
summarizes possible expressions is constructed. The structure allows
for a more efficient and compact representation compared to lattice
structures that were previously used in statistical sentence
generation approaches. Using dynamic programming, the highest ranked
sentence from this structure is then output. Many other systems using
similar ideas exist, e.g.
        [19, 14]
        .

        A second line of attack formalizes NLG as an AI planning problem.
SPUD
        [18]
        , a system for NLG through microplanning,
considers NLG as a problem which requires realizing a deliberative
process of goal-directed activity. Many such NLG-as-planning systems
use a pipeline architecture, working from their communicative goal
through
discourse planning and sentence generation. In
discourse planning, information to be conveyed is selected and split
into sentence-sized chunks. These sentence-sized chunks are then sent
to a
        sentence generator
        , which itself is usually split into two
tasks,
        sentence planning
        and
        surface realization
        [11]
        . The sentence planner takes in a
sentence-sized chunk of information to be conveyed and enriches it in
some way. This is then used by a
        surface realization
        module which encodes the enriched semantic representation into
natural language. This chain is sometimes referred to as the
“NLG Pipeline”
        [16]
        .

        Another approach, called
        integrated generation
        , considers both
sentence generation portions of the pipeline
together
        [10]
        . This is the approach taken in
some modern generators like CRISP
        [10]
        and
PCRISP
        [1]
        . In these generators, the input
semantic requirements and grammar are encoded in
PDDL
        [4]
        , which an off-the-shelf planner such as
Graphplan
        [2]
        uses to produce a list of
applications of rules in the grammar. These generators generate parses
for the sentence at the same time as the sentence, which keeps them
from generating realizations that are grammatically incorrect, and
keeps them from generating grammatical structures that cannot be
realized properly.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        In the NLG-as-planning framework, the choice of grammar representation
is crucial in treating NLG as a planning problem; the grammar provides
the actions that the planner will use to generate a sentence. Tree
Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) are a common choice
        [10, 1]
        . TAGs are
tree-based grammars consisting of two sets of trees, called initial
trees and auxiliary or adjoining trees. An entire initial tree can
replace a leaf node in the sentence tree whose label matches the label
of the root of the initial tree in a process called “substitution.”
Auxiliary trees, on the other hand, encode recursive structures of
language. Auxiliary trees have, at a minimum, a root node and a foot
node whose labels match. The foot node must be a leaf of the
auxiliary tree. These trees are used in a three-step process called
“adjoining”. The first step finds an adjoining location by
searching through our sentence to find any subtree with a root whose
label matches the root node of the auxiliary tree. In the second
step, the target subtree is removed from the sentence tree, and placed
in the auxiliary tree as a direct replacement for the foot node.
Finally, the modified auxiliary tree is placed back in the sentence
tree in the original target location. We use a variation of TAGs in
our work, called a lexicalized TAG (LTAG), where each tree is
associated with a lexical item called an anchor.

        Though the NLG-as-planning approaches are elegant and appealing, a key
drawback is the difficulty of handling probabilistic grammars, which
are readily handled by the overgeneration and ranking
strategies. Recent approaches such as
PCRISP
        [1]
        attempt to remedy this, but do so in
a somewhat ad-hoc way, by transforming the probabilities into costs,
because they rely on deterministic planning to actually realize the
output. In this work, we directly address this by using a more
expressive underlying formalism, a Markov decision process (MDP). We
show empirically that this modification has other benefits as
well, such as being anytime and an ability to handle complex
communicative goals beyond those that deterministic planners can
handle.

        We note that prior work exists that uses MDPs for
NLG
        [13]
        . That work differs from ours in several key
respects: (i) it considers NLG at a coarse level, for example
choosing the type of utterance (in a dialog context) and how to fill in specific slots in a
template, (ii) the source of uncertainty is not language-related but
comes from things like uncertainty in speech recognition, and (iii)
the MDPs are solved using reinforcement learning and not planning,
which is impractical in our setting. However, that work does consider NLG
in the context of the broader task of dialog management, which we
leave for future work.

         STRUCT uses a first-order logic-based semantic model in its
communicative goal and world specification. This model describes
named “entities,” representing general things in the world. Entities
with the same name are considered to be the same entity. These
entities are described using first-order logic predicates, where
the name of the predicate represents a statement of truth about the
given entities. In this semantic model, the communicative goal is a
list of these predicates with variables used for the entity names.
For instance, a communicative goal of ‘red(d), dog(d)’ (in English,
“say anything about a dog which is red.”) would match a sentence with
the semantic representation ‘red(subj), dog(subj), cat(obj),
chased(subj, obj)’, like “The red dog chased the cat”, for instance.

         A grammar contains a set of PTAG trees, divided into two sets (initial

Entities are defined as any element anchored by precisely one node in
the tree which can appear in a statement representing the semantic
content of the tree. In addition to this set of trees, the grammar
contains a list of words which can be inserted into those trees,
turning the PTAG into an PLTAG. We refer to this list as a lexicon.
Each word in the lexicon is annotated with its first-order logic
semantics with any number of entities present in its subtree as the

         A world specification is simply a list of all statements which are

refer to the same entity. We use the closed world assumption, that
is, any statement not present in our world is false. Before execution
begins, our grammar is pruned to remove entries which cannot possibly
be used in generation for the given problem, by transitively
discovering all predicates that hold about the entities mentioned in
the goal in the world, and eliminating all trees not about any of
these. This often allows STRUCT to be resilient to large grammar
sizes, as our experiments will show.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         We formulate NLG as a planning problem on a Markov decision process
(MDP)
         [15]
         . An MDP is a tuple
         (S,A,T,R,γ)
         where
         S
         is a
set of states,
         A
         is a set of actions available to an agent,
         T:S×A×S→[0,1]
         is a possibly stochastic
function defining the probability
         T⁢(s,a,s′)
         with which the
environment transitions to
         s′
         when the agent does
         a
         in state
         s
         .
         R:S×A×S→ℝ
         is a real-valued reward function that
specifies the utility of performing action
         a
         in state
         s
         to reach
another state. Finally,
         γ
         is a discount factor that allows planning over infinite
horizons to converge. In such an MDP, the agent selects actions at
each state to optimize the expected infinite-horizon discounted reward.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         In the MDP we use for NLG, we must define each element of the tuple in
such a way that a plan in the MDP becomes a sentence in a natural
language. Our set of states, therefore, will be partial sentences
which are in the language defined by our PLTAG input. There are an
infinite number of these states, since TAG adjoins can be repeated
indefinitely. Nonetheless, given a specific world and communicative
goal, only a fraction of this MDP needs to be explored, and, as we
show below, a good solution can often be found quickly using a variation of
the UCT algorithm
         [9]

particular valid location in the tree (example shown in
Figure
         1
         ). Since we are using PLTAGs in this work,
this means every action adds a word to the partial sentence. In
situations where the sentence is complete (no nonterminals without
children exist), we add a dummy action that the algorithm may choose
to stop generation and emit the sentence. Based on these state and
action definitions, the transition function takes a mapping between a
partial sentence / action pair and the partial sentences which can
result from one particular PLTAG adjoin / substitution, and returns
the probability of that rule in the grammar.

         In order to control the search space, we restrict the structure of the
MDP so that while substitutions are available, only those operations
are considered when determining the distribution over the next state,
without any adjoins. We do this is in order to generate a
complete and valid sentence quickly. This allows STRUCT to operate as
an anytime algorithm, described further below.

         The immediate value of a state, intuitively, describes closeness of an
arbitrary partial sentence to our communicative goal. Each partial
sentence is annotated with its semantic information, built up using
the semantic annotations associated with the PLTAG trees. Thus we use
as a reward a measure of the match between the semantic annotation of
the partial tree and the communicative goal. That is, the
larger the overlap between the predicates, the higher the reward. For
an exact reward signal, when checking this overlap, we need to
substitute each combination of entities in the goal into predicates in
the sentence so we can return a high value if there are any mappings
which are both possible (contain no statements which are not present
in the grounded world) and mostly fulfill the goal (contain most of
the goal predicates). However, this is combinatorial; also, most
entities within sentences do not interact (e.g. if we say “the white
rabbit jumped on the orange carrot,” the whiteness of the rabbit has
nothing to do with the carrot), and finally, an approximate reward
signal generally works well enough unless we need to emit nested
subclauses. Thus as an approximation, we use a reward signal where we
simply count how many individual predicates overlap with the goal with
         some
         entity substitution. In the experiments, we illustrate the
difference between the exact and approximate reward signals.

         The final component of the MDP is the discount factor. We generally use a
discount factor of 1; this is because we are willing to generate
lengthy sentences in order to ensure we match our goal. A discount
factor of 1 can be problematic in general since it can cause rewards
to diverge, but since there are a finite number of terms in our reward
function (determined by the communicative goal and the fact that
because of lexicalization we do not loop), this is not a problem
for us.

        The Probabilistic Planner

         We now describe our approach to solving the MDP above to generate a sentence.
Determining the optimal policy at
         every
         state in an MDP is
polynomial in the size of the state-action
space
         [3]
         , which is intractable in our case. But
for our application, we do not need to find the optimal policy. Rather
we just need to
         plan
         in an MDP to achieve a
         given
         communicative goal. Is it possible to do this without exploring the
entire state-action space? Recent work answers this question
affirmatively. New techniques such as sparse
sampling
         [7]
         and UCT
         [9]
         show how to generate near-optimal plans in large MDPs with a time
complexity that is independent of the state space size. Using the UCT
approach with a suitably defined MDP (explained above) allows us to
naturally handle probabilistic grammars as well as formulate NLG as a
planning problem, unifying the distinct lines of attack described
in Section
         2
         . Further, the theoretical guarantees of UCT translate
into fast generation in many cases, as we demonstrate in our
experiments.

         Online planning in MDPs as done by UCT follows two steps. From each state
encountered, we construct a lookahead tree and use it to estimate the
utility of each action in this state. Then, we take the best action,
the system transitions to the next state and the procedure is
repeated. In order to build a lookahead tree, we use a “rollout
policy.” This policy has two components: if it encounters a state
already in the tree, it follows a “tree policy,” discussed further
below. If it encounters a new state, the policy reverts to a
“default” policy that randomly samples an action. In all cases, any
rewards received during the rollout search are backed up. Because this
is a Monte Carlo estimate, typically, we run several simultaneous trials,
and we keep track of the rewards received by each choice and use
this to select the best action at the root.

exploitation. This essentially treats each action decision
as a bandit problem; previous work shows that this approach can
efficiently select near-optimal actions at each state.

         We use a modified version of UCT in order to increase its usability in
the MDP we have defined. First, because we receive frequent,
reasonably accurate feedback, we favor breadth over depth in the tree
search. That is, it is more important in our case to try a variety of
actions than to pursue a single action very deep. Second, UCT was
originally used in an adversarial environment, and so is biased to
select actions leading to the best average reward rather than the
action leading to the best overall reward. This is not true for us,
however, so we choose the latter action instead.

         With the MDP definition above, we use our modified UCT to find a
solution sentence (Algorithm
         3.3
         ). After every action is
selected and applied, we check to see if we are in a state in which
the algorithm could terminate (i.e. the sentence has no nonterminals
yet to be expanded). If so, we determine if this is the best
possibly-terminal state we have seen so far. If so, we store it, and
continue the generation process. Whenever we reach a terminal state,
we begin again from the start state of
the MDP. Because of the structure restriction above (substitution
before adjoin), STRUCT generates a valid sentence quickly. This
enables STRUCT to perform as an anytime algorithm, which
if interrupted will return the highest-value complete and valid
sentence it has found. This also allows partial completion of communicative goals if
not all goals can be achieved simultaneously in the time given.

        In this section, we compare STRUCT to a state-of-the-art NLG system,
CRISP,

comparable in speed and generation quality to CRISP as it generates
increasingly large referring expressions, (ii) STRUCT is
comparable in speed and generation quality to CRISP as the size of the
grammar which they use increases, and (iii) STRUCT is capable of

         Referring Expressions
         We first evaluate CRISP and STRUCT on
their ability to generate referring expressions. Following prior
work
         [11]
         , we consider a series of sentence
generation problems which require the planner to generate a sentence
like “The Adj
         1
         Adj
         2
         … Adj
         k
         dog chased the cat.”, where
the string of adjectives is a string that distinguishes one dog (whose
identity is specified in the problem description) from all other
entities in the world. In this experiment,
         m⁢a⁢x⁢D⁢e⁢p⁢t⁢h
         was set equal to
1, since each action taken improved the sentence in a way measurable
by our reward function.
         n⁢u⁢m⁢T⁢r⁢i⁢a⁢l⁢s
         was set equal to
         k⁢(k+1)
         ,
since this is the number of adjoining sites available in the final
step of generation, times the number of potential words to adjoin.
This allows us to ensure successful generation in a single loop of the
STRUCT algorithm.
        </p>
       </div>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS1.p3">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         The experiment has two parameters:
         j
         , the number of adjectives in
the grammar, and
         k
         , the number of adjectives necessary to
distinguish the entity in question from all other entities. We set
         j=k
         and show the results in Figure
         2
         .
We observe that CRISP was able to achieve
sub-second or similar times for all expressions of less than length 5, but its
generation times increase exponentially past that point, exceeding 100
seconds for some plans at length 10. At length 15, CRISP failed to
generate a referring expression; after 90 minutes the Java garbage
collector terminated the process. STRUCT (the “STRUCT_final” line) performs much better and
is able to generate much longer referring expressions without failing.
Later experiments had successful referring expression generation of lengths
as high as 25. The “STRUCT_initial” curve shows the time taken by
STRUCT to come up with the first complete sentence, which partially
solves the goal and which (at least) could be output if generation was
interrupted and no better alternative was found. As can be seen, this
always happens very quickly.

         Grammar Size
         .
We next evaluate STRUCT and CRISP’s ability to
handle larger grammars. This experiment is set up in the same way as
the one above, with the exception of
         l
         “distracting” words, words
which are not useful in the sentence to be generated.
         l
         is defined
as
         j-k
         . In these experiments, we vary
         l
         between 0 and 50.
Figure
         6
         shows the results of these
experiments. We observe that CRISP using GraphPlan, as previously
reported in
         [11]
         , handles an increase in
number of unused actions very well. Prior work reported a difference
on the order of single milliseconds moving from
         j=1
         to
         j=10
         .
We report similar variations in CRISP runtime as
         j
         increases from 10
to 60: runtime increases by approximately 10% over that range.

         No Pruning
         . If we do not prune the grammar (as described in
Section
         3.1
         ), STRUCT’s performance is similar to CRISP
using the FF planner
         [5]
         , also profiled in
         [11]
         , which increased from 27 ms to 4.4
seconds over the interval from
         j=1
         to
         j=10
         . STRUCT’s
performance is less sensitive to larger grammars than this, but over
the same interval where CRISP increases from 22 seconds of runtime to
27 seconds of runtime, STRUCT increases from 4 seconds to 32 seconds.
This is due almost entirely to the required increase in the value of
         n⁢u⁢m⁢T⁢r⁢i⁢a⁢l⁢s
         as the grammar size increases. At the low end,
we can use
         n⁢u⁢m⁢T⁢r⁢i⁢a⁢l⁢s=20
         , but at
         l=50
         , we must use
         n⁢u⁢m⁢T⁢r⁢i⁢a⁢l⁢s=160
         in order to
ensure perfect generation as soon as possible. Note that, as STRUCT
is an anytime algorithm, valid sentences are available very early in
the generation process, despite the size of the set of adjoining
trees. This time does not change substantially with increases in
grammar size. However, the time to perfect this solution does.

         With Pruning
         . STRUCT’s performance improves significantly if
we allow for pruning. This experiment involving distracting words
is an example of a case where pruning will perform well.
When we apply pruning, we find that STRUCT is able to ignore the effect of
additional distracting words. Experiments showed roughly constant times for generation
for
         j=1
         through
         j=5000
         . Our experiments
do not show any significant impact on runtime due to the pruning
procedure itself, even on large grammars.

         Multiple Goals
         .
We first evaluate STRUCT’s ability to accomplish
multiple communicative goals when generating a single sentence. In this
experiment, we modify the problem from the
previous section. In that section, the referred-to dog was unique,
and it was therefore possible to produce a referring expression which
identified it unambiguously. In this experiment, we remove this
condition by creating a situation in which the generator will be
forced to ambiguously refer to several dogs. We then add to the
world a number of adjectives which are common to each of these
possible referents. Since these adjectives do not further
disambiguate their subject, our generator should not use
them in its output. We then encode these adjectives into
communicative goals, so that they will be included in the output of
the generator despite not assisting in the accomplishment of
disambiguation. For example, assume we had two black cats, and
we wanted to say that one of them was sleeping, but we wanted
to emphasize that it was a black cat. We would have as our goal
both “sleeps(c)” and “black(c)”. We want the generator to
say “the black cat sleeps”, instead of simply “the cat sleeps.”

         We find that, in all cases, these otherwise useless
adjectives are included in the output of our generator, indicating
that STRUCT is successfully balancing multiple communicative goals.
As we show in figure
         6
         (the “Positive
Goals” curve) , the presence of additional satisfiable semantic goals does
not substantially affect the time required for generation. We are able to
accomplish this task with the same very high frequency as the CRISP
comparisons, as we use the same parameters.

         Negated Goals
         .
We now evaluate STRUCT’s ability to generate
sentences given negated communicative goals. We again modify
the problem used earlier by
adding to our lexicon several new adjectives, each applicable only to
the target of our referring expression. Since our target can now be
referred to unambiguously using only one adjective, our generator
should just select one of these new adjectives (we experimentally
confirmed this).
We then encode these
adjectives into negated communicative goals, so that they will not be
included in the output of the generator, despite allowing a much
shorter referring expression. For example, assume we have a
tall spotted black cat, a tall solid-colored white cat, and a short spotted
brown cat, but we wanted to refer to the first one without
using the word “black”.

       <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS2.p5">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         We find that these adjectives which
should have been selected immediately are omitted from the output, and
that the sentence generated is the best possible under the
constraints. This demonstrates that STRUCT is balancing these negated
communicative goals with its positive goals. Figure
         6
         (the “Negative Goals” curve) shows the
impact of negated goals on the time to generation. Since this
experiment alters the grammar size, we see the time to final
generation growing linearly with grammar size. The increased time to
generate can be traced directly to this increase in grammar size.
This is a case where pruning does not help us in reducing the grammar size;
we cannot optimistically prune out words that we do not plan to use. Doing
so might reduce the ability of STRUCT to produce a sentence which partially
fulfills its goals.

         Nested subclauses
         . Next, we evaluate STRUCT’s ability to generate
sentences with nested subclauses. An example of such a sentence is
“The dog which ate the treat chased the cat.” This is a difficult
sentence to generate for several reasons. The first, and clearest, is
that there are words in the sentence which do not help to increase the
score assigned to the partial sentence. Notably, we must adjoin the
word “which” to “the dog” during the portion of generation where the
sentence reads “the dog chased the cat”. This decision requires us to
do planning deeper than one level in the MDP, which increases the
number of simulations STRUCT requires in order to get the correct result.
In this case, we require lookahead further into the tree than depth 1.
We need to know that using “which” will allow us to further specify
which dog is chasing the cat; in order to do this we must use at least
         d=3
         . Our reward function must determine this with, at a minimum,
the actions corresponding to “which”, “ate”, and “treat”. For these experiments, we use the
exact reward function for STRUCT.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         Despite this issue, STRUCT is capable of generating these sentences.
Figure
         6
         shows the score of STRUCT’s generated output over
time for two nested clauses. Notice that, because the exact reward function is being used,
the time to generate is longer in this experiment. To the best of our
knowledge, CRISP is not able to generate sentences of this form due to
an insufficiency in the way it handles TAGs, and consequently we
present our results without this baseline.

         Conjunctions
         .
Finally, we evaluate STRUCT’s ability to generate sentences including
conjunctions. We introduce the conjunction “and”, which allows for the
root nonterminal of a new sentence (‘S’) to be adjoined to any other sentence.
We then provide STRUCT with multiple goals. Given sufficient depth for the
search (
         d=3
         was sufficient for our experiments, as our reward signal is fine-grained),
STRUCT will produce two sentences joined by the conjunction “and”.
Again, we follow prior work in our experiment design

         10
         , STRUCT successfully generates results
for conjunctions of up to five sentences. This is not a hard upper bound, but
generation times begin to be impractically large at that point.
Fortunately, human language tends toward
shorter sentences than these unwieldy (but technically grammatical) sentences.

         STRUCT increases in generation time both as the number of sentences increases and as
the number of objects per sentences increases.
We compare our results to those presented in
         [11]
         for
CRISP with the FF Planner. They attempted to generate sentences with
three entities and failed to find a result within their 4 GB memory limit. As we
can see, CRISP generates a result slightly faster than STRUCT when we are
working with a single entity, but works much much slower for two entities
and cannot generate results for a third entity. According to Koller’s findings,
this is because the search space grows by a factor of the universe size with
the addition of another entity

       Conclusion
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        We have proposed STRUCT, a general-purpose natural language generation
system which is comparable to current state-of-the-art generators.
STRUCT formalizes the generation problem as an MDP and applies a version of the UCT
algorithm, a fast online MDP planner, to solve it. Thus, STRUCT
naturally handles probabilistic grammars. We demonstrate empirically
that STRUCT is anytime, comparable to existing generation-as-planning
systems in certain NLG tasks, and is also capable of handling other,
more complex tasks such as negated communicative goals.

        Though STRUCT has many interesting properties, many directions for
exploration remain. Among other things, it would be desirable to
integrate STRUCT with discourse planning and dialog systems.
Fortunately, reinforcement learning has already been investigated in
such contexts
        [13]
        , indicating that an MDP-based generation procedure could
be a natural fit in more complex generation systems. This is a primary
direction for future work. A second direction is that, due to the
nature of the approach, STRUCT is highly amenable to parallelization.
None of the experiments reported here use parallelization, however, to
be fair to CRISP. We plan to parallelize STRUCT in future work, to
take advantage of current multicore architectures. This should obviously
further reduce generation time.
