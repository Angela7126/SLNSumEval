       Introduction
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Recently, many new features have been explored for SMT and significant performance have been obtained in terms of translation quality, such as syntactic features, sparse features, and reordering features. However, most of these features are manually designed on linguistic phenomena that are related to bilingual language pairs, thus they are very difficult to devise and estimate.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Instead of designing new features based on intuition, linguistic knowledge and domain, for the first time, Maskey and Zhou (2012) explored the possibility of inducing new features in an unsupervised fashion using deep belief net (DBN)
        [Hinton et al.2006]
        for hierarchical phrase-based translation model. Using the 4 original phrase features in the phrase table as the input features, they pre-trained the DBN by contrastive divergence
        [Hinton2002]
        , and generated new unsupervised DBN features using forward computation. These new features are appended as extra features to the phrase table for the translation decoder.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        However, the above approach has two major shortcomings. First, the input original features for the DBN feature learning are too simple, the limited 4 phrase features of each phrase pair, such as bidirectional phrase translation probability and bidirectional lexical weighting
        [Koehn et al.2003]
        , which are a bottleneck for learning effective feature representation. Second, it only uses the unsupervised layer-wise pre-training of DBN built with stacked sets of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)
        [Hinton2002]
        , does not have a training objective, so its performance relies on the empirical parameters. Thus, this approach is unstable and the improvement is limited. In this paper, we strive to effectively address the above two shortcomings, and systematically explore the possibility of learning new features using deep (multi-layer) neural networks (DNN, which is usually referred under the name
        Deep Learning
        ) for SMT.

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p4">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        To address the first shortcoming, we adapt and extend some simple but effective phrase features as the input features for new DNN feature learning, and these features have been shown significant improvement for SMT, such as, phrase pair similarity
        [Zhao et al.2004]
        , phrase frequency, phrase length
        [Hopkins and May2011]
        , and phrase generative probability
        [Foster et al.2010]
        , which also show further improvement for new phrase feature learning in our experiments.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        To address the second shortcoming, inspired by the successful use of DAEs for handwritten digits recognition
        [Hinton and Salakhutdinov2006, Hinton et al.2006]
        , information retrieval
        [Salakhutdinov and Hinton2009, Mirowski et al.2010]
        , and speech spectrograms
        [Deng et al.2010]
        , we propose new feature learning using semi-supervised DAE for phrase-based translation model. By using the input data as the teacher, the “semi-supervised” fine-tuning process of DAE addresses the problem of “back-propagation without a teacher”
        [Rumelhart et al.1986]
        , which makes the DAE learn more powerful and abstract features
        [Hinton and Salakhutdinov2006]
        . For our semi-supervised DAE feature learning task, we use the unsupervised pre-trained DBN to initialize DAE’s parameters and use the input original phrase features as the “teacher” for semi-supervised back-propagation. Compared with the unsupervised DBN features, our semi-supervised DAE features are more effective and stable.

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p6">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Moreover, to learn high dimensional feature representation, we introduce a natural horizontal composition for DAEs (HCDAE) that can be used to create large hidden layer representations simply by horizontally combining two (or more) DAEs
        [Baldi2012]
        , which shows further improvement compared with single DAE in our experiments.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        It is encouraging that, non-parametric feature expansion using gaussian mixture model (GMM)
        [Nguyen et al.2007]
        , which guarantees invariance to the specific embodiment of the original features, has been proved as a feasible feature generation approach for SMT. Deep models such as DNN have the potential to be much more representationally efficient for feature learning than shallow models like GMM. Thus, instead of GMM, we use DNN (DBN, DAE and HCDAE) to learn new non-parametric features, which has the similar evolution in speech recognition
        [Dahl et al.2012, Hinton et al.2012]
        . DNN features are learned from the non-linear combination of the input original features, they strong capture high-order correlations between the activities of the original features, and we believe this deep learning paradigm induces the original features to further reach their potential for SMT.

        Finally, we conduct large-scale experiments on IWSLT and NIST Chinese-English translation tasks, respectively, and the results demonstrate that our solutions solve the two aforementioned shortcomings successfully. Our semi-supervised DAE features significantly outperform the unsupervised DBN features and the baseline features, and our introduced input phrase features significantly improve the performance of DAE feature learning.

        Recently, there has been growing interest in use of DNN for SMT tasks. Le et al. (2012) improved translation quality of n-gram translation model by using a bilingual neural LM, where translation probabilities are estimated using a continuous representation of translation units in lieu of standard discrete representations. Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) introduced recurrent continuous translation models that comprise a class for purely continuous sentence-level translation models. Auli et al. (2013) presented a joint language and translation model based on a recurrent neural network which predicts target words based on an unbounded history of both source and target words. Liu et al. (2013) went beyond the log-linear model for SMT and proposed a novel additive neural networks based translation model, which overcome some of the shortcomings suffered by the log-linear model: linearity and the lack of deep interpretation and representation in features. Li et al. (2013) presented an ITG reordering classifier based on recursive auto-encoders, and generated vector space representations for variable-sized phrases, which enable predicting orders to exploit syntactic and semantic information. Lu et al. (2014) adapted and extended the max-margin based RNN
        [Socher et al.2011]
        into HPB translation with force decoding and converting tree, and proposed a RNN based word topology model for HPB translation, which successfully capture the topological structure of the words on the source side in a syntactically and semantically meaningful order.

        However, none of these above works have focused on learning new features automatically with input data, and while learning suitable features (representations) is the superiority of DNN since it has been proposed. In this paper, we systematically explore the possibility of learning new features using DNN for SMT.

        In this paper, instead of designing new features based on intuition, linguistic knowledge and domain, we have learned new features using the DAE for the phrase-based translation model. Using the unsupervised pre-trained DBN to initialize DAE’s parameters and using the input original phrase features as the “teacher” for semi-supervised back-propagation, our semi-supervised DAE features are more effective and stable than the unsupervised DBN features
        [Maskey and Zhou2012]
        . Moreover, to further improve the performance, we introduce some simple but effective features as the input features for feature learning. Lastly, to learn high dimensional feature representation, we introduce a natural horizontal composition of two DAEs for large hidden layers feature learning.

        On two Chinese-English translation tasks, the results demonstrate that our solutions solve the two aforementioned shortcomings successfully. Firstly, our DAE features obtain statistically significant improvements of 1.34/2.45 (IWSLT) and 0.82/1.52 (NIST) BLEU points over the DBN features and the baseline features, respectively. Secondly, compared with the baseline phrase features

        significantly improve the performance of not only our DAE features but also the DBN features.
