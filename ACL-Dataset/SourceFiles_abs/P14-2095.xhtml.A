       Introduction

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Cross-lingual model transfer approaches are concerned with creating statistical models for various tasks for languages poor in annotated resources, utilising resources or models available for these tasks in other languages.
That includes approaches such as
        direct model transfer
        []
        and
        annotation projection
        []
        .
Such methods have been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, including POS tagging
        []
        , syntactic parsing
        []
        , semantic role labeling
        []
        and others.

      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Direct model transfer attempts to find a shared feature representation for samples from the two languages, usually generalizing and abstracting away from language-specific representations.
Once this is achieved, instances from both languages can be mapped into this space and a model trained on the source-language data directly applied to the target language.
If parallel data is available, it can be further used to enforce model agreement on this data to adjust for discrepancies between the two languages, for example by means of
        projected transfer
        []
        .
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        The shared feature representation depends on the task in question, but most often each aspect of the original feature representation is handled separately.
Word types, for example, may be replaced by cross-lingual word clusters
        []
        or cross-lingual distributed word representations
        []
        .
Part-of-speech tags, which are often language-specific, can be converted into universal part-of-speech tags
        []
        and morpho-syntactic information can also be represented in a unified way
        []
        .
Unfortunately, the design of such representations and corresponding conversion procedures is by no means trivial.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Annotation projection, on the other hand, does not require any changes to the feature representation.
Instead, it operates on translation pairs, usually on sentence level, applying the available source-side model to the source sentence and transferring the resulting annotations through the word alignment links to the target one.
The quality of predictions on source sentences depends heavily on the quality of parallel data and the domain it belongs to (or, rather, the similarity between this domain and that of the corpus the source-language model was trained on).
The transfer itself also introduces errors due to translation shifts
        []
        and word alignment errors, which may lead to inaccurate predictions.
These issues are generally handled using heuristics
        []
        and filtering, for example based on alignment coverage

        Motivation
       </h3>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS1.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         The approach proposed here, which we will refer to as
         feature representation projection
         (
         FRP
         ), constitutes an alternative to direct model transfer and annotation projection and can be seen as a compromise between the two.
        </p>
       </div>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS1.p2">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         It is similar to direct transfer in that we also use a shared feature representation.
Instead of designing this representation manually, however, we create compact monolingual feature representations for source and target languages separately and automatically estimate the mapping between the two from parallel data.
This allows us to make use of language-specific annotations and account for the interplay between different types of information.
For example, a certain preposition attached to a token in the source language might map into a morphological tag in the target language, which would be hard to handle for traditional direct model transfer other than using some kind of refinement procedure involving parallel data.
Note also that any such refinement procedure applicable to direct transfer would likely work for
         FRP
         as well.

       <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.SS1.p3">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         Compared to annotation projection, our approach may be expected to be less sensitive to parallel data quality, since we do not have to commit to a particular prediction on a given instance from parallel data.
We also believe that
         FRP
         may profit from using other sources of information about the correspondence between source and target feature representations, such as dictionary entries, and thus have an edge over annotation projection in those cases where the amount of parallel data available is limited.

        This task consists in identifying predicates and their arguments in sentences and assigning each argument a semantic role with respect to its predicate (see figure
        1

Note that only a single word – the syntactic head of the argument phrase – is marked as an argument in this case, as opposed to constituent- or span-based SRL

We focus on the assignment of semantic roles to identified arguments.

Also, should one like to apply constraints on the set of semantic roles in a given predicate, or, for example, use a reranker

        Feature Representation

        <p class="ltx_p">
         Our objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification.

         Estimating the mapping directly from raw categorical features (
         ω0
         ) is both computationally expensive and likely inaccurate – using one-hot encoding the feature vectors in our experiments would have tens of thousands of components.
There is a number of ways to make this representation more compact.
To start with, we replace word types with corresponding neural language model representations estimated using the skip-gram model
         []
         .
This corresponds to
         Ms
         and
         Mt
         above and reduces the dimension of the feature space, making direct estimation of the mapping practical.
We will refer to this representation as

         ω1

In source language, one can even directly tune an intermediate representation for the target problem.

The word types themselves are left as they are in the source language and replaced with their gloss translations in the target one

         The annotation projection baseline implementation is straightforward.
The source-side instances from a parallel corpus are labeled using a classifier trained on source-language training data and transferred to the target side. The resulting annotations are then used to train a target-side classifier for evaluation.
Note that predicate and argument identification in both languages is performed using monolingual classifiers and only aligned pairs are used in projection.
A more common approach would be to project the whole structure from the source language, but in our case this may give unfair advantage to feature representation projection, which relies on target-side argument identification.

We did not tune the size of the word representation to our task, as this would not be appropriate in a cross-lingual transfer setup, but we observe that the classifier is relatively robust to their dimension when evaluated on source language – in our experiments the performance of the monolingual classifier does not improve significantly if the dimension is increased past 300 and decreases only by a small margin (less than one absolute point) if it is reduced to 100.
It should be noted, however, that the dimension that is optimal in this sense is not necessarily the best choice for

        Better Monolingual Representations

         The representation we used in the initial evaluation does not discriminate between aspects that are relevant for the assignment of semantic roles and those that are not.
Since we are using a relatively small set of features to start with, this does not present much of a problem.
In general, however, retaining only relevant aspects of intermediate monolingual representations would simplify the estimation of mapping between them and make
         FRP
         more robust.

         For source language, this is relatively straightforward, as the intermediate representation can be directly tuned for the problem in question using labeled training data.
For target language, however, we assume that no labeled data is available and auxiliary tasks have to be used to achieve this.

        Alternative Sources of Information

         The amount of parallel data available for many language pairs is growing steadily.
However, cross-lingual transfer methods are often applied in cases where parallel resources are scarce or of poor quality and must be used with care.
In such situations an ability to use alternative sources of information may be crucial.
Potential sources of such information include dictionary entries or information about the mapping between certain elements of syntactic structure, for example a known part-of-speech tag mapping.

         The available parallel data itself may also be used more comprehensively – aligned arguments of aligned predicates, for example, constitute only a small part of it, while the mapping of vector representations of individual tokens is likely to be the same for all aligned words.

        Multi-source Transfer

         One of the strong points of direct model transfer is that it naturally fits the multi-source transfer setting.
There are several possible ways of adapting
         FRP
         to such a setting.
It remains to be seen which one would produce the best results and how multi-source feature representation projection would compare to, for example, multi-source projected transfer
