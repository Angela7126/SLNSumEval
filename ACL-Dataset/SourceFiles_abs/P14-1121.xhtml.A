        The bilingual lexicon extraction task from bilingual corpora was initially addressed by using parallel corpora (i.e. a corpus that contains source texts and their translation). However, despite good results in the compilation of bilingual lexicons, parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for technical domains and for language pairs not involving English. For these reasons, research in bilingual lexicon extraction has focused on another kind of bilingual corpora comprised of texts sharing common features such as domain, genre, sampling period, etc. without having a source text/target text relationship
        [21]
        . These corpora, well known now as
        comparable corpora
        , have also initially been introduced as
        non-parallel corpora
        [11, 28]
        , and
        non-aligned corpora
        [31]
        . According to Fung and Cheung (2004)
        , who range bilingual corpora from parallel corpora to quasi-comparable corpora going through comparable corpora, there is a continuum from parallel to comparable corpora (i.e. a kind of filiation).
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        The bilingual lexicon extraction task from comparable corpora inherits this filiation. For instance, the historical context-based projection method
        [11, 28]
        , known as the
        standard approach
        , dedicated to this task seems implicitly to lead to work with balanced comparable corpora in the same way as for parallel corpora (i.e. each part of the corpus is composed of the same amount of data).

        In this paper we want to show that the assumption that comparable corpora should be balanced for bilingual lexicon extraction task is unfounded. Moreover, this assumption is prejudicial for specialized comparable corpora, especially when involving the English language for which many documents are available due the prevailing position of this language as a standard for international scientific publications. Within this context, our main contribution consists in a re-reading of the standard approach putting emphasis on the unfounded assumption of the balance of the specialized comparable corpora. In specialized domains, the comparable corpora are traditionally of small size (around 1 million words) in comparison with comparable corpus-based general language (up to 100 million words). Consequently, the observations of word co-occurrences which is the basis of the standard approach are unreliable. To make them more reliable, our second contribution is to contrast different regression models in order to boost the observations of word co-occurrences. This strategy allows to improve the quality of extracted bilingual lexicons from comparable corpora.

        Standard Approach
       </h3>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS1.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts. The basis of this observation consists in the identification of “first-order affinities” for each source and target language: “
         First-order affinities describe what other words are likely to be found in the immediate vicinity of a given word
         ”
         [14, p. 279]
         . These affinities can be represented by context vectors, and each vector element represents a word which occurs within the window of the word to be translated (e.g. a seven-word window approximates syntactic dependencies). In order to emphasize significant words in the context vector and to reduce word-frequency effects, the context vectors are normalized according to an association measure. Then, the translation is obtained by comparing the source context vector to each translation candidate vector after having translated each element of the source vector with a general dictionary.

         The implementation of the standard approach can be carried out by applying the following three steps

            words around
            i
            . For each word
            i

            vi

         This approach is sensitive to the choice of parameters such as the size of the context, the choice of the association and similarity measures. The most complete study about the influence of these parameters on the quality of word alignment has been carried out by Laroche and Langlais

         The standard approach is used by most researchers so far
         [28, 12, 25, 29, 3, 7, 13, 22, 18, 26, 2, among others]
         with the implicit hypothesis that comparable corpora are balanced. As McEnery and Xiao (2007, p. 21)
         observe, a specialized comparable corpus is built as balanced by analogy with a parallel corpus: “
         Therefore, in relation to parallel corpora, it is more likely for comparable corpora to be designed as general balanced corpora.
         ”. For instance, Table
         2
         describes the comparable corpora used in the main work dedicated to bilingual lexicon extraction for which the ratio between the size of the source and the target texts is comprised between 1 and 1.8.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         In fact, the assumption that words which have the same meaning in different languages should have the same lexical context distributions does not involve working with balanced comparable corpora. To our knowledge, no attention
         has been paid to the problem of using unbalanced comparable corpora for bilingual lexicon extraction. Since the context vectors are computed from each part of the comparable corpus rather than through the parts of the comparable corpora, the standard approach is relatively insensitive to differences in corpus sizes. The only precaution for using the standard approach with unbalanced corpora is to normalize the association measure (for instance, this can be done by dividing each entry of a given context vector by the sum of its association scores).

        Prediction Model
       </h3>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS2.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         Since comparable corpora are usually small in specialized domains (see Table
         2
         ), the discriminative power of context vectors (i.e. the observations of word co-occurrences) is reduced. One way to deal with this problem is to re-estimate co-occurrence counts by a prediction function
         [15]
         . This consists in assigning to each observed co-occurrence count of a small comparable corpora, a new value learned beforehand from a large training corpus.

         In order to make co-occurrence counts more discriminant and in the same way as Hazem and Morin
         [15]
         , one strategy consists in addressing this problem through regression: given training corpora of small and large size (abundant in the general domain), we predict word co-occurrence counts in order to make them more reliable. We then apply the resulting regression function to each word co-occurrence count as a pre-processing step of the standard approach. Our work differs from Hazem and Morin
         [15]
         in two ways. First, while they experienced the linear regression model, we propose to contrast different regression models. Second, we apply regression to unbalanced comparable corpora and study the impact of prediction when applied to the source texts, the target texts and both source and target texts of the used comparable corpora.

            The documents making up the French part of the comparable corpus have been craweled from the web using three keywords:

            using the keywords:
            diabetes
            ,
            nutrition

         The French and English documents were then normalised through the following linguistic pre-processing steps: tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatisation. These steps were carried out using the TTC TermSuite
         that applies the same method to several languages including French and English. Finally, the function words were removed and the words occurring less than twice in the French part and in each English part were discarded. Table
         3
         shows the number of distinct words (# words) after these steps. It also indicates the comparability degree in percentage (comp.) between the French part and each English part of each comparable corpus. The comparability measure
         [19]
         is based on the expectation of finding the translation for each word in the corpus and gives a good idea about how two corpora are comparable. We can notice that all the comparable corpora have a high degree of comparability with a better comparability of the breast cancer corpora as opposed to the diabetes corpora.

        Standard Approach Evaluation

       <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.SS1.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         In order to evaluate the influence of corpus size on the bilingual terminology extraction task, two experiments have been carried out using the standard approach. We first performed an experiment using each comparable corpus independently of the others (we refer to these corpora as balanced corpora). We then conducted a second experiment where we varied the size of the English part of the comparable corpus, from 530,000 to 7.4 million words for the breast cancer corpus in 530,000 words steps, and from 250,000 to 3.5 million words for the diabetes corpus in 250,000 words steps (we refer to these corpora as unbalanced corpora). In the experiments reported here, the size of the context window
         w
         was set to 3 (i.e. a seven-word window that approximates syntactic dependencies), the retained association and similarity measures were the discounted log-odds and the Cosine (see Section
         2.1
         ). The results shown were those that give the best performance for the comparable corpora used individually.

         i
         (
         i∈[1,14]
         ) of a given comparable corpus. The first line presents the results for each individual comparable corpus and the second line presents the results for the cumulative comparable corpus. For instance, the column 3 indicates the MAP obtained by using a comparable corpus that is composed i) only of
         [
         breast cancer corpus 3

We can also note that the MAP of all the unbalanced comparable corpora is always higher than any individual comparable corpus. Overall, starting with a MAP of 26.1% as provided by the balanced
         [
         breast cancer corpus 1
         ]
         , we are able to increase it to 42.3% with the unbalanced
         [
         breast cancer corpus 12
         ]
         (the variation observed for some unbalanced corpora such as
         [
         diabetes corpus 12, 13 and 14
         ]
         can be explained by the fact that adding more data in the source language increases the error rate of the translation phase of the standard approach, which leads to the introduction of additional noise in the translated context vectors).

          That said, the gain of regression models is not significant. This may be due to the regression parameters that have been learned from a training corpus of the general domain. Another reason that could explain these results is the prediction process. We applied the same regression function to all co-occurrence counts while learning models for low and high frequencies should have been more appropriate. In the light of the above results, we believe that prediction can be beneficial to our task.

In this case, applying prediction to the source side may simulate a configuration of using unbalanced comparable corpora where the source side is
          n
          times bigger than the target side. Predicting the target side only, may leads us to the opposite configuration where the target side is

It is not surprising that predicting the target side only leads to lower results, since it is well known that a better characterization of a word to translate (given from the source side) leads to better results. We can deduce from Table
          5
          that source prediction is the most appropriate configuration to improve the quality of extracted lexicons. This configuration which simulates the use of unbalanced corpora leads us to think that using prediction with unbalanced comparable corpora should also increase the performance of the standard approach. This assumption is evaluated in the next Subsection.

       Conclusion
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        In this paper, we have studied how an unbalanced specialized comparable corpus could influence the quality of the bilingual lexicon extraction. This aspect represents a significant interest when working with specialized comparable corpora for which the quantity of the data collected may differ depending on the languages involved, especially when involving the English language as many scientific documents are available. More precisely, our different experiments show that using an unbalanced specialized comparable corpus always improves the quality of word translations. Thus, the MAP goes up from 29.6% (best result on the balanced corpora) to 42.3% (best result on the unbalanced corpora) in the breast cancer domain, and from 16.5% to 26.0% in the diabetes domain. Additionally, these results can be improved by using a prediction model of the word co-occurrence counts. Here, the MAP goes up from 42.3% (best result on the unbalanced corpora) to 46.9% (best result on the unbalanced corpora with prediction) in the breast cancer domain, and from 26.0% to 29.8% in the diabetes domain.
We hope that this study will pave the way for using specialized unbalanced comparable corpora for bilingual lexicon extraction.
