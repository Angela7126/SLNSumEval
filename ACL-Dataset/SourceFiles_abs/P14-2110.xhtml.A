        Topic models
        []
        have become standard tools for analyzing document collections, and
topic analyses are quite common for social media
        []
        .
Their popularity owes in part to their data driven nature, allowing them to adapt to new
corpora and languages.
In social media especially, there is a large diversity in terms of both the topic
and language,
necessitating the modeling of multiple languages simultaneously.
A good candidate for multi-lingual topic analyses are polylingual topic models
        []
        ,
which learn topics for multiple languages, creating tuples of language specific distributions over monolingual vocabularies for each topic.
Polylingual topic models enable cross language analysis by grouping documents by topic
regardless of language.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Training of polylingual topic models requires parallel or comparable corpora:
document tuples from multiple languages that discuss the same topic. While
additional non-aligned documents can be folded in during training, the “glue” documents
are required to aid in the alignment across languages.
However, the ever changing vocabulary and topics of social media
        []
        make finding suitable comparable corpora difficult. Standard techniques – such
as relying on machine translation parallel corpora or comparable documents extracted
from Wikipedia in different languages – fail to capture the specific terminology of social media.
Alternate methods that rely on bilingual
lexicons
        []
        similarly fail to adapt to shifting vocabularies. The result:
an inability to train polylingual models on social media.

        In this paper, we offer a solution: utilize code-switched social media to discover correlations across languages.
Social media is filled with examples of code-switching, where users switch between two or more languages, both
in a conversation and even a single message
        []
        .
This mixture of languages in the same context suggests alignments between words across languages through
the common topics discussed in the context.

        We learn from code-switched social media by extending the polylingual topic model framework
to infer the language of each token and then automatically processing the learned topics to identify
aligned topics.
Our model improves both in terms of perplexity and a human evaluation, and we provide some example
analyses of social media that rely on our learned topics.

        Code-switched documents has received considerable attention in the NLP community.
Several tasks have focused on identification and analysis, including mining translations in code-switched documents
        []
        , predicting code-switched points
        []
        ,
identifying code-switched tokens

adding code-switched support to language models

        Code-switching specifically in social media has also received some recent attention.
        trained a supervised token level language identification system for
Spanish and English code-switched social media to study code-switching behaviors.
        mined translation spans for Chinese and English
in code-switched documents to improve a translation system,
relying on an existing translation model to aid in the identification and extraction task.
In contrast to this work, we take an unsupervised approach, relying only on readily available document level
language ID systems to utilize code-switched data. Additionally, our focus is not on individual messages, rather
we aim to train a model that can be used to analyze entire corpora.

        In this work we consider two types of code-switched documents: single messages and conversations, and two
language pairs: Chinese-English and Spanish-English.
Figure

        conversation
        , in which three users discuss
Mexico’s football team advancing to the Gold medal game in the 2012 Summer Olympics.
In this conversation, some tweets are code-switched and some are in a single language. By collecting the entire
conversation into a single document we provide the topic model with additional content.
An example of a Chinese-English code-switched messages is given by

       <p class="ltx_p">
        To train a polylingual topic model on social media, we
make two modifications to the model of
        : add a token specific language variable, and a process for identifying aligned
topics.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        First, polylingual topic models require parallel or comparable corpora in which each document has an assigned
language. In the case of code-switched social media data, we require a
        per-token
        language variable.
However, while document level language identification (LID) systems are common place, very few languages have
per-token LID systems
        []
        .
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p3">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        To address the lack of available LID systems, we add a per-token latent language variable to the polylingual topic model.
For documents that are not code-switched, we observe these variables
to be the output of a document level LID system. In the case of code-switched documents,
these variables are inferred during model inference.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p4">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Second, polylingual topic models assume the aligned topics are from parallel or comparable corpora, which implicitly
assumes that a topics popularity is balanced across languages. Topics that show up in one language necessarily
show up in another.
However, in the case of social media, we can make no such assumption. The topics discussed are influenced
by users, time, and location, all factors intertwined with choice of language.
For example, English speakers will more likely discuss Olympic basketball while Spanish speakers football.
There may be little or no documents on a given topic in one language, while they are plentiful
in another. In this case, a polylingual topic model, which necessarily infers a topic-specific word distribution for each topic
in each language, would learn two unrelated word distributions in two languages for a single topic.
Therefore, naively using the produced topics as “aligned” across languages is ill-advised.

      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S3.p5">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Our solution is to automatically identify aligned polylingual topics after learning by examining a topic’s distribution across
code-switched documents. Our metric relies on distributional properties of an inferred topic across the entire collection.

        Selecting Aligned Topics

        <p class="ltx_p">
         We next identify learned topics (a set of related word-distributions) that truly represent an aligned topic across
languages, as opposed to an unrelated set of distributions for which there is no supporting alignment
evidence in the corpus.
We begin by measuring how often each topic occurs in code-switched documents. If a topic never
occurs in a code-switched document, then there can be no evidence to support alignment across languages.
For the topics that appear at least once in a code-switched document,
we estimate their probability in the code-switched documents by a MAP estimate of
         θ
         .
Topics appearing in at least one code-switched document with probability greater than a threshold
         p
         are selected as
candidates for true cross-language topics.

languages for a given document with confidence scores; we identify a tweet as code-switched if two predicted languages
each have confidence greater than 33%.
We then used the tagger of

We further expanded the mined tweets to full conversations, yielding 1055 Spanish-English code-switched documents (including both tweets and conversations), along with 4007 English and 4421 Spanish tweets composes our data set. We reserve 10% of the data for testing.

        We evaluated csLDA on the two datasets and evaluated each model using perplexity on held out data and human judgements.
While our goal is to learn polylingual topics, we cannot compare to previous polylingual models since they require comparable data,
which we lack. Instead, we constructed a baseline from
LDA run on the entire dataset (no language information.)
For each model, we measured the document completion perplexity
        []
        on the held out data.
We experimented with different numbers of topics (
        𝒯
        ). Since csLDA duplicates topic
distributions (
        𝒯×ℒ
        )
we used twice as many topics for LDA.

We ran csLDA-bg with

which gives csLDA high quality LID labels.
While we see gains for the code-switched data,
overall the results for csLDA-bg and csLDA-bg with LID are similar, suggesting that the model can
operate effectively even without a supervised per-token LID system.

         LDA may learn comparable topics in different languages
but gives no explicit alignments.
We create alignments
by classifying each LDA topic by language using the KL-divergence between the topic’s words distribution and a word distribution
for the English/foreign language inferred from the monolingual documents.
Language is assigned to a topic by taking the minimum KL. For Weibo data, this was not effective since the vocabularies
of each language are highly unbalanced. Instead, we manually labeled the topics by language.
We then pair topics across languages using the cosine similarity of their co-occurrence statistics in code-switched documents.
Topic pairs with similarity above
         t
         are considered aligned topics. We also used a threshold
         p
         (§
         3.2
         )
to select aligned topics in csLDA.
To ensure a fair comparison, we select the same number of aligned topics for LDA and csLDA.

         Using Mechanical Turk we collected multiple judgements per alignment.
For Spanish, we removed workers who disagreed with the majority more than 50% of the time (83 deletions),
leaving 6.5 annotations for each alignment (85.47% inter-annotator agreement.)
For Chinese, since quality of general Chinese turkers is low
         []
         we invited specific workers and obtained 9.3 annotations per alignment (78.72% inter-annotator agreement.)
For Olympics, LDA alignments matched the judgements 25% of the time, while csLDA matched 50% of the time.
While csLDA found 12 alignments and LDA 29, the 12 topics evaluated from both models show that csLDA’s alignments
are higher quality.
For the Weibo data, LDA matched judgements 71.4%, while csLDA matched 75%. Both obtained high quality alignments –
likely due both to the fact that the code-switched data is curated to find translations and we hand labeled topic language –
but csLDA found many more alignments: 60 as compared to 28. These results confirm our automated results: csLDA finds higher
quality topics that span both languages.
