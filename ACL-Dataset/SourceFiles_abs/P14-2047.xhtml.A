       Introduction

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        In this study we examine how the use of discourse devices to organize information in a sentence — and the mismatch in their usage across languages — influence machine translation (MT) quality. The goal is to identify discourse processing tasks with high potential for improving translation systems.

        Historically MT researchers have focused their attention on the mismatch of linear realization of syntactic arguments
        [5, 4]
        ,
lexico-morphological mismatch
        [14, 6]
        and word polysemy
        [1, 2]
        .
Discourse structure has largely been considered irrelevant to MT, mostly due to the assumption that discourse analysis is needed to interpret multi-sentential text while statistical MT systems are trained to translate a single sentence in one language into a single sentence in another.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        However, discourse devices are at play in the organization of information into complex sentences. The mere definition of sentence may differ across languages. Chinese for example is anecdotally known to allow for very long sentences
which at times require the use of multiple English sentences to express the same content and preserve grammaticality. Similarly discourse connectives like
        because, but, since
        and
        while
        often relate information expressed in simple sentential clauses. There are a number of possible complications in translating these connectives: they may be ambiguous between possible senses, e.g., English
        while
        is ambiguous between
        comparison
        and
        temporal
        ;
explicit discourse connectives may be translated into implicit discourse relations or translated in morphology rather than lexical items

        We examine the quality of translations to English from Chinese and Arabic using Human-targeted Translation Edit Rates (HTER)
        [18]
        , which roughly captures the minimal number of edits necessary to transform the system output into an acceptable English translation of the source sentence.
By comparing MT output with post-edited references, HTER provides more reliable estimates of translation quality than using translated references, especially at the segment level.
The data for the analysis is drawn from an extended set of newswire reports in the 2008/2010 NIST Metrics for Machine Translation GALE Evaluation set
        . For Chinese, there are 305 sentences (segments) translated to English by three different translation systems. For Arabic, there are 363 Arabic sentences (segments) translated by two systems.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        The presence of discourse devices is analyzed only on the English side:
the reference, the system hypothesis and its edited translation.
Discourse connectives and their senses are identified using existing tools developed for English.
Beyond its practical limitations, analyzing the reference interestingly reflects the choices made by the human translator: whether to choose to use a discourse connective, or to insert one to make an implicit relation on the source side explicit on the target side.

        We first conduct analysis of variance (ANOVA) with HTER as dependent variable and the discourse factors
as independent variables, and systems as subjects. We examine within-subject significance in each ANOVA model. For discourse factors that are significant at the 95% confidence level or higher according to the ANOVA analysis, we provide detailed breakdown of the system HTER for each value of the discourse factor.

       Sentence length and HTER

        The presence of complex discourse structure is likely to be associated with longer sentences. It stands to reason that long sentences will be harder to process automatically and this reasoning has motivated the first approaches to text simplification
        [3]
        . So before turning to the analysis of discourse phenomena, we examine the correlation between translation quality and sentence length. A strong correlation between the two would call for revival of interest in text simplification where syntactically complex sentences are transformed into several shorter sentences as a preprocessing step.

       When a sentence becomes discourse

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Some languages allow more information to be packed into a single sentence than is possible in another language, making single-sentence translations cumbersome and often ungrammatical.
Chinese is known for sentences of this kind; for example, the usage of punctuation is very different in Chinese in the sense that a comma can sometimes function as a full stop in English, motivating a series of disambiguation tasks
        [7, 20, 19]
        . Special handling of long Chinese sentences were also shown to improve machine translation
        [8, 21]
        .

       <p class="ltx_p">
        To investigate the prevalence of sentences in the source language (Chinese and Arabic in our case) that do not confirm to the notion of sentence in the target language (English for the purposes of this study), we separate the translation segments in the source language into two classes:
a source sentence is considered 1-1 if the reference translation consists of exactly one sentence, and 1-many if the reference contains more than one sentence.

      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S4.p3">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        For Chinese, 26.2% of the source segments are 1-many. These sentences tend to be much longer than average
(36.6% of all words in all reference translations are part of such segments).
For Arabic, the numbers are 15.2% and 26.3%, respectively. Below is an example of a 1-many Chinese segment, along with the human reference and its translation by one of the systems:

        We conducted ANOVA on HTER, separately for each language, with type of segment (1-1 or 1-many) as the independent variable and systems treated as subjects. The test revealed that there is a significant difference in translation quality between 1-1 and 1-many segments for Chinese but not for Arabic.
For the Chinese to English systems we further ran a Wilcoxon rank sum test to identify the statistical significance in performance for individual systems. For two of the three systems the difference is significant, as shown in Table

        We have now established that 1-many segments in Chinese to English translation are highly prevalent and their translations are of consistently lower quality compared to 1-1 segments. This finding suggests a cross language discourse analysis task of identifying Chinese sentences that cannot be translated into single English sentences.
This task may be related to existing efforts in comma disambiguation in Chinese
        [7, 20, 19]
        but the relationship between the two problems needs to be clarified in follow up work. Once 1-many segments are identified, source-side text simplification techniques may be developed
        [17]
        to improve translation quality.

       Explicit discourse relations

        Explicit discourse relations such as
        comparison, contingency
        or
        temporal
        are signaled by an explicit connective, i.e.,
        however
        or
        because
        . The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB)
        [16]
        provides annotations for the arguments and relation senses of one hundred pre-selected discourse connectives over the news portion of the Penn Treebank corpus
        [11]
        . Based on the PDTB, accurate systems for explicit discourse relation identification
have been developed
        [15, 10]
        . The accuracy of these systems is 94% or higher, close to human performance on the task.
Here we study the influence of explicit discourse relations on machine translation quality and their interaction with 1-1 and 1-many segments.

         The ANOVA indicates that the number of connectives is not a significant factor for Arabic translation, but significantly impacts Chinese translation quality. A closer inspection using Wilcoxon rank sum tests
reveals that the difference in translation quality is statistically significant only between the groups of segments with no connective vs. those with more than one connective. Additionally, we ran Wilcoxon rank sum test over 1-1 and 1-many segments individually and find that the presence of discourse connectives is associated with worse quality only in the latter case.

        Ambiguity of connectives

       <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS2.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         A number of discourse connectives are ambiguous with respect to the discourse relation they convey. For example,
         while
         can signal either
         comparison
         or
         temporal
         relations and

         can signal either
         contingency
         or
         temporal
         . In translation this becomes a problem when the ambiguity is present in one language but not in the other. In such cases the sense in source ought to be disambiguated before translation.
Here we compare the translation quality of segments which contain ambiguous discourse connectives in the reference translation to
those that do not. This analysis gives lower bound on the translation quality degradation associated with discourse phenomena as it does not capture problems arising from connective ambiguity on the source side.

         comparison
         relations in the reference translation with those that do not.

         contingency

         in Chinese contains more ambiguity with other relations such as
         temporal

        Due to the lack of reliable tools and resources, we approximate mismatches between discourse expressions in the source and MT output using discourse-related edits.
We identify explicit discourse connectives and their senses in the system translation and the human edited version of that translation.
Then we consider the following mutually exclusive possibilities:
        (i)
        there are no discourse connectives in either the system output or the edit;
        (ii)
        the system output and its edited version contain exactly the same discourse connectives with the same senses;
        (iii)
        there is a discourse connective present in the system output but not in the edit or vice versa. In the ANOVA we use a factor with three levels corresponding to the three cases described above. The factor is significant for both Chinese and Arabic.
In both languages, the mismatch case

        Obviously, the mismatch in implicit/explicit expression of discourse relation is related to the first problem we studied, i.e., if the source segment is translated into one or multiple sentences in English,
since discourse relations between adjacent sentences are more often implicit (than intra-sentence ones).
For this reason we performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test for the translation quality of segments with discourse mismatch conditioned on whether the segment was 1-1 or 1-many.
For both languages a significant difference was found for 1-1 sentences but not 1-many.
Table

the proportion of data in each of the conditioned classes and the average HTER for sentences from the mismatch case

        We showed that translation from Chinese to English is made more difficult by various discourse events such as
the use of discourse connectives, the ambiguity of the connectives and the type of relations they signal. None of these discourse factors has a significant impact on translation quality from Arabic to English. Translation quality from both languages is adversely affected by translations of discourse relations expressed implicitly in one language but explicitly in the other or by paired connectives.
Our experiments indicate that discourse usage may affect machine translation between some language pairs but not others, and for particular relations such as
        contingency
        .
Finally, we established the need to identify sentences in the source language that would be translated into multiple sentences in English. Especially in translating from Chinese to English, there is a large number of such sentences which are currently translated much worse than other sentences.
