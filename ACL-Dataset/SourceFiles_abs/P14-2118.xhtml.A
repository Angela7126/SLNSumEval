        Concreteness
        , the degree to which language has a perceptible physical referent, and
        subjectivity
        , the extent to which linguistic meaning depends on the perspective of the speaker, are well established cognitive and linguistic notions. Recent results suggest that they could also be useful knowledge for natural language processing systems that aim to extract and represent the meaning of language.

        Insight into concreteness can help systems to classify adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics. In the non-literal expressions

        Subjectivity analysis has already proved highly applicable to a range of NLP applications, including sentiment analysis, information extraction and text categorization
        [22, 24]
        . For such applications, subjectivity is analyzed at the phrasal or document level. However, recent work has highlighted the application of subjectivity analysis to lexical semantics, for instance to the tasks of disambiguating words according to their usage or sense
        [28, 2]
        .

        The importance of concreteness to NLP systems is likely to grow with the emergence of multi-modal semantic models
        [8, 25]
        . Such models, which learn representations from both linguistic and perceptual input, outperform text-only models on a range of evaluations. However, while multi-modal models acquire richer representations of concrete concepts, their ability to represent abstract concepts can be weaker than text-only models
        [13]
        . A principled treatment of concreteness is thus likely to be important if the multi-modal approach is to prove effective on a wider range of concepts. In a similar vein, interest in subjectivity analysis is set to grow with interest in extracting sentiment and opinion from the web and social media
        [3]
        . Moreover, given that humans seem to exploit both concreteness
        [20]
        and subjectivity
        [10]
        clues when processing language, it is likely that the same clues should benefit computational models aiming to replicate human-level performance in this area.

        In this paper, we show how concreteness and subjectivity can be applied together to produce performance improvements on two classification problems: distinguishing literal and non-literal adjective-noun pairs
        [27]
        , and classifying the modification type exhibited by such pairs
        [5]
        . We describe an unsupervised corpus-based method to quantify adjective subjectivity, and show that it effectively predicts the labels of a hand-coded subjectivity lexicon. Further, we show for the first time that adjective subjectivity correlates with noun concreteness in large corpora. In addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics. We conclude by discussing other potential applications of concreteness and subjectivity to NLP.

         A large and growing body of empirical evidence indicates clear differences between concrete concepts, such as
         donut
         or
         hotdog
         and abstract concepts, such as
         guilt
         or
         obesity
         . Concrete words are more easily learned, remembered and processed than abstract words
         [21]
         , while differences in brain activity
         [4]
         and cognitive representation
         [13]
         have also been observed. In linguistic conctructions, concreteness appears to influence compound and phrasal semantics
         [26, 7, 27]
         . Together with the practical applications outlined in Section 1, these facts indicate the potential value of concreteness for models aiming to replicate human performance in language processing tasks.

         Subjectivity is the degree to which language is interpretable independently of the speaker’s perspective

         is more subjective than
         he sits opposite Sam
         as its truth depends on the speaker’s position. Language may also be subjective because it conveys evaluations or opinions

         Quirk et al. (1985)

         ), rather than attributive constructions (
         the German capital

         wooden shed
         ) are more objective than those conveying abstract traits (
         suspicious man
         ). Indeed, in certain cases the original, apparently objective, senses of polysemous adjectives are not modifiable (
         very wooden shed

The results of our analyses also demonstrate a clear interaction between subjectivity and concreteness scores for nouns attributed by human raters. Specifically, objective adjectives are more likely to modify concrete nouns and subjective adjectives are more likely to modify abstract nouns. Qualitative investigations further suggest the interaction between these dimensions to be useful in the semantic characterization of adjective-noun pairs, a proposition we test formally in the next section.

         On the non-literal composition task, the concreteness (83.0) and combined (85.0) models outperform that of Turney et al. (79.0). The concreteness model performance represents further confirmation of the link between concreteness and composition. The improvement of this model over
         Turney et al. (2011)
         is perhaps to be expected, since our model exploits the wide scope of the new
         Brysbaert et al. (2013)
         crowdsourced data whereas Turney et al. infer concreteness scores from a smaller training set. Notably, our combined model improves on the concreteness-only model, confirming that the interaction of concreteness and subjectivity provides additional information pertinent to meaning composition.

         The modification-type task has no performance benchmark since
         Boleda et al. (2012)
         do not use their data for classification. Although all models improve on the majority-class baseline, the combined model was again most effective. Additive improvement over the baseline in each case was lower than for the composition task, which may reflect the greater subtlety inherent in the subsective/intersective classification. Indeed, inter-annotator agreement for this goldstandard (Cohen’s
         κ=0.87
         ) was lower than for the composition task (0.95), implying a less cognitively salient distinction.

       Conclusion

        We have shown that objective adjectives are most likely to modify concrete nouns, and that non-literal combinations can emerge when this principle is violated (Section 3). Indeed, the occurrence of an adjective with a more abstract noun than those it typically modifies is a strikingly consistent indicator of metaphoricity (Table 2). In addition, we showed that both concreteness and subjectivity improve the automatic classification of adjective-noun pairs according to compositionality or modification type (Section 4). Importantly, a classifier with both subjectivity and concreteness features outperforms concreteness-only classifiers, including those proposed in previous work.

        The results underline the relevance of both subjectivity and concreteness to lexical and phrasal semantics, and their application to language processing tasks. We hypothesize that concreteness and subjectivity are fundamental to human language processing because language is precisely the conveyance of information about the world from one party to another. In decoding this signal, it is clearly informative to understand to what extent the information refers directly to the world, and also to what extent it reports a fact versus an opinion. We believe these dimensions will ultimately prove essential for computational systems aiming to replicate human performance in interpreting language. As the results suggest, they may be particularly important for capturing the intricacies of semantic composition and thus extending representations beyond the lexeme.

        Of course, two dimensions alone are not sufficient to reflect all of the subtleties of adjective and noun semantics. For instance, our model classifies
        white spirit
        , a transparent cleaning product, as non-literal, since the lexical concreteness score does not allow for strong noun polysemy. Further, it makes no allowance for wider sentential context, which can be an important clue to modification type in such cases.

        We aim to address these limitations in future work by integrating subjectivity and concreteness with conventially acquired semantic representations, and, ultimately, models that integrate input corresponding to the perceptual modalities.
