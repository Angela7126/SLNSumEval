       <p class="ltx_p">
        To disambiguate a homonymous word in a given context,
        proposed a method that measured the degree
of overlap between the glosses of the target and context words. Known
as the Lesk algorithm, this simple and intuitive method has since been
extensively cited and extended in the word sense disambiguation (WSD)
community. Nonetheless, its performance in several WSD benchmarks is
less than satisfactory
        ()
        . Among the
popular explanations is a key limitation of the algorithm, that
“Lesk’s approach is very sensitive to the exact wording of
definitions, so the absence of a certain word can radically change the
results.”

       <p class="ltx_p">
        Compounding this problem is the fact that many Lesk variants limited
the concept of overlap to the literal interpretation of string
matching (with their own variants such as length-sensitive matching
        ()
        , etc.), and it was not until recently that
overlap started to take on other forms such as tree-matching
        ()
        and vector space models
        ()
        . To
address this limitation, a Naive Bayes model (NBM) is proposed in this
study as a novel, probabilistic treatment of overlap in gloss-based
WSD.

        In the extraordinarily rich literature on WSD, we focus our review on
those closest to the topic of Lesk and NBM. In particular, we opt for
the “simplified Lesk”
        ()
        , where
inventory senses are assessed by gloss-context overlap rather than
gloss-gloss overlap. This particular variant prevents proliferation of
gloss comparison on larger contexts

is shown to outperform the original Lesk algorithm

        To the best of our knowledge, NBMs have been employed exclusively as
classifiers in WSD — that is, in contrast to their use as a
similarity measure in this study.
        used NB
classifier resembling an information retrieval system: a WSD instance
is regarded as a document
        d
        , and candidate senses are scored in
terms of “relevance” to
        d
        . When evaluated on a WSD benchmark
        ()
        , the algorithm compared favourably to
Lesk variants (as expected for a supervised
method).
        proposed an ensemble model with
multiple NB classifiers differing by context window size.
        trained an unsupervised NB classifier using
the EM algorithm and empirically demonstrated the benefits of
WordNet-assisted

        feature selection over local
syntactic features.

        Among Lesk variants,
        extended the gloss of
both inventory senses and the context words to include words in their
related synsets in WordNet. Senses were scored by the sum of overlaps
across all relation pairs, and the effect of individual relation pairs
was evaluated in a later work
        ()
        . Overlap
was assessed by string matching, with the number of matching words
squared so as to assign higher scores to multi-word overlaps.

        Breaking away from string matching,
        measured overlap as similarity between gloss- and context-vectors,
which were aggregated word vectors encoding second order co-occurrence
information in glosses. An extension by

related glosses in WordNet.
        measured
overlap by

        More recently,
        proposed a
tree-matching algorithm that measured gloss-context overlap as the
weighted sum of dependency-induced lexical
distance.
        constructed a
        sentential
        similarity measure
        ()
        using
        lexical
        similarity measures

vectors. A related approach
        ()
        also used
Wikipedia-induced concepts to encoded sentential vectors. These
systems compared favourably to existing methods in WSD performance,
although by using sense frequency information, they are essentially
supervised methods.

        Distributional methods have been used in many WSD systems in quite
different flavours than the current
study.
        proposed a Lesk variant where
each gloss word is weighted by its
        idf
        score in relation to
all glosses, and gloss-context association was incremented by these
weights rather than binary, overlap counts.
        used distributional thesauri as a knowledge base to increase overlaps,
which were, again, assessed by string matching.

        In conclusion, the majority of Lesk variants focused on extending the
gloss to increase the chance of overlapping, while the proposed NBM
aims to make better use of the limited lexical knowledge available. In
contrast to string matching, the probabilistic nature of our model
offers a “softer” measurement of gloss-context association,
resulting in a novel approach to unsupervised WSD with
state-of-the-art performance in more than one WSD benchmark (Section

        Incorporating Additional Lexical Knowledge

        <p class="ltx_p">
         The input of the proposed NBM is bags of words, and thus it is
straightforward to incorporate various forms of lexical knowledge (LK)
for word senses: by concatenating a tokenized knowledge source to the
existing knowledge representation

measure remains unchanged.

         The availability of LK largely depends on the sense inventory used in
a WSD task. WordNet senses are often used in Senseval and SemEval
tasks, and hence senses (or synsets, and possibly their corresponding
word forms) that are semantic related to the inventory senses under
WordNet relations are easily obtainable and have been exploited by
many existing studies.

these relations are equally helpful.” Relation pairs involving
hyponyms were shown to result in better F-measure when used in gloss
overlaps
         ()
         . The authors attributed the
phenomenon to the the multitude of hyponyms compared to other
relations. We further hypothesize that, beyond sheer numbers, synonyms

distinguish the senses of a given ambiguous word, and thus are more
effective knowledge sources for WSD.

(e.g.,

coarse-grained WSD, this generality is likely to inflate the
hypernyms’ probabilistic estimation. Hyponyms, on the other hand, help
specify their corresponding senses with information that is possibly
missing from the often overly brief glosses: the many technical terms
as hyponyms in Table
         1
         — though rare —
are likely to occur in the (possibly domain-specific) contexts that
are highly typical of the corresponding senses. Particularly for the
NBM, the co-occurrence is likely to result in stronger
gloss-definition associations when similar contexts appear in a WSD
instance.

gloss-based WSD and is beyond the scope of the current
discussion.
         Overall, all three sources of LK may complement each other
in WSD tasks, with hyponyms particularly promising in both quantity

         To study the effect of different types of LK in WSD (Section

synonyms (

         ), hypernyms (
         hpr
         ), and hyponyms
(
         hpo
         ) as extended LK in addition to its gloss. The WSD model
is evaluated with gloss-only (
         glo
         ), individual extended LK
sources, and the combination of all four sources (
         all
         ). The

         By using only glosses, the proposed model already shows statistically
significant improvement over the basic Lesk algorithm (92.4% and
140.5% relative improvement in Senseval-2 coarse- and fine-grained
tracks, respectively).
         Moreover, comparison between coarse- and
fine-grained tracks reveals interesting properties of different LK
sources. Previous hypotheses (Section
         3.3
         )
are empirically confirmed that WSD performance benefits most from
hyponyms and least from hypernyms. Specifically, highly similar,
fine-grained sense candidates apparently share more hypernyms in the
fine-grained case than in the coarse-grained case; adding to the
generality of hypernyms (both semantic and distributional), we
postulate that their probability in the NBM is uniformly inflated
among many sense candidates, and hence they decrease in
distinguishability. Synonyms might help with regard to semantic
specification, though their limited quantity also limits their
benefits. These patterns on the LK types are consistent in all three
experiments.

       Conclusions and Future Work
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        We have proposed a general-purpose Naive Bayes model for measuring
association between two sets of random events. The model replaced
string matching in the Lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation
with a probabilistic measure of gloss-context overlap. The base model
on average more than doubled the accuracy of Lesk in Senseval-2 on
both fine- and coarse-grained tracks. With additional lexical
knowledge, the model also outperformed state of the art results with
statistical significance on two coarse-grained WSD tasks.

      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        For future work, we plan to apply the model in other shared tasks,
including open-text WSD, so as to compare with more recent Lesk
variants. We would also like to explore how to incorporate syntactic
features and employ alternative statistical methods (e.g., parametric
models) to improve probability estimation and inference. Other NLP
problems involving compositionality in general might also benefit from
the proposed many-to-many similarity measure.
