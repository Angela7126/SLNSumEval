   Much of the recent work on dependency parsing has been focused on solving inherent combinatorial problems associated with rich scoring functions.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   In contrast, we demonstrate that highly expressive scoring functions can be used with substantially simpler inference procedures.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Specifically, we introduce a sampling-based parser that can easily handle arbitrary global features.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Inspired by SampleRank, we learn to take guided stochastic steps towards a high scoring parse.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We introduce two samplers for traversing the space of trees, Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings with Random Walk.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   The model outperforms state-of-the-art results when evaluated on 14 languages of non-projective CoNLL datasets.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Our sampling-based approach naturally extends to joint prediction scenarios, such as joint parsing and POS correction.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   The resulting method outperforms the best reported results on the CATiB dataset, approaching performance of parsing with gold tags.
