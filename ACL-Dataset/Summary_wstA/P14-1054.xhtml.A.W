   The automatic estimation of machine translation (MT) output quality is a hard task in which the selection of the appropriate algorithm and the most predictive features over reasonably sized training sets plays a crucial role.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   When moving from controlled lab evaluations to real-life scenarios the task becomes even harder.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   For current MT quality estimation (QE) systems, additional complexity comes from the difficulty to model user and domain changes.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Indeed, the instability of the systems with respect to data coming from different distributions calls for adaptive solutions that react to new operating conditions.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   To tackle this issue we propose an online framework for adaptive QE that targets reactivity and robustness to user and domain changes.

  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Contrastive experiments in different testing conditions involving user and domain changes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
