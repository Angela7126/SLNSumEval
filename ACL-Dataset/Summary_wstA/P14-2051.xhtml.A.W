   We show that it is possible to automatically detect machine translated text at sentence level from monolingual corpora, using text classification methods.

   We show further that the accuracy with which a learned classifier can detect text as machine translated is strongly correlated with the translation quality of the machine translation system that generated it.

   Finally, we offer a generic machine translation quality estimation technique based on this approach, which does not require reference sentences.
