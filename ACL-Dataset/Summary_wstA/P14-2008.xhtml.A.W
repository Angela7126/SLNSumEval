   We present a study of aspects of discourse structure specifically discourse devices used to organize information in a sentence that significantly impact the quality of machine translation.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Our analysis is based on manual evaluations of translations of news from Chinese and Arabic to English.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We find that there is a particularly strong mismatch in the notion of what constitutes a sentence in Chinese and English, which occurs often and is associated with significant degradation in translation quality.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Also related to lower translation quality is the need to employ multiple explicit discourse connectives ( because, but , etc.), as well as the presence of ambiguous discourse connectives in the English translation.

   Furthermore, the mismatches between discourse expressions across languages significantly impact translation quality.
