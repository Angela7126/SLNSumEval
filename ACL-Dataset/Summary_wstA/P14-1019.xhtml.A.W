   We present CoSimRank , a graph-theoretic similarity measure that is efficient because it can compute a single node similarity without having to compute the similarities of the entire graph.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We present equivalent formalizations that show CoSimRank s close relationship to Personalized PageRank and SimRank and also show how we can take advantage of fast matrix multiplication algorithms to compute CoSimRank.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Another advantage of CoSimRank is that it can be flexibly extended from basic node-node similarity to several other graph-theoretic similarity measures.

   In an experimental evaluation on the tasks of synonym extraction and bilingual lexicon extraction, CoSimRank is faster or more accurate than previous approaches.
