   Incorrect normalization of text can be particularly damaging for applications like text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) or typing auto-correction, where the resulting normalization is directly presented to the user, versus feeding downstream applications.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   In this paper, we focus on abbreviation expansion for TTS, which requires a do no harm , high precision approach yielding few expansion errors at the cost of leaving relatively many abbreviations unexpanded.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   In the context of a large-scale, real-world TTS scenario, we present methods for training classifiers to establish whether a particular expansion is apt.

   We achieve a large increase in correct abbreviation expansion when combined with the baseline text normalization component of the TTS system, together with a substantial reduction in incorrect expansions.
