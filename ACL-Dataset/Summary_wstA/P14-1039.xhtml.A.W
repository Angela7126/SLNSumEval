   We present an unsupervised method for inducing verb classes from verb uses in giga-word corpora.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Our method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   By taking this step-wise approach, we can not only generate verb classes based on a massive amount of verb uses in a scalable manner, but also deal with verb polysemy, which is bypassed by most of the previous studies on verb clustering.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In our experiments, we acquire semantic frames and verb classes from two giga-word corpora, the larger comprising 20 billion words.

  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The effectiveness of our approach is verified through quantitative evaluations based on polysemy-aware gold-standard data.
