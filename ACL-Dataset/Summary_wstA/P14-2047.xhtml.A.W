   All possible NE candidates are represented as nodes in the graph and associations between different candidates are represented by edges between the nodes.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Each node has an initial confidence score, e.g., entity popularity.

  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Page-Rank is used to rank nodes and the final rank is combined with the initial confidence for candidate selection.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Experiments on 27,819 NE textual mentions show the effectiveness of using Page-Rank in conjunction with initial confidence.

   87% accuracy is achieved, outperforming both baseline and state-of-the-art approaches.
