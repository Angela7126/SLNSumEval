   The ability to accurately represent sentences is central to language understanding.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We describe a convolutional architecture dubbed the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that we adopt for the semantic modelling of sentences.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The network uses Dynamic k -Max Pooling, a global pooling operation over linear sequences.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The network handles input sentences of varying length and induces a feature graph over the sentence that is capable of explicitly capturing short and long-range relations.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The network does not rely on a parse tree and is easily applicable to any language.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   We test the DCNN in four experiments small scale binary and multi-class sentiment prediction, six-way question classification and Twitter sentiment prediction by distant supervision.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   The network achieves excellent performance in the first three tasks and a greater than 25 % error reduction in the last task with respect to the strongest baseline.
