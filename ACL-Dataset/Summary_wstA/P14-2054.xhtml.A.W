   The focus of this paper is to determine the correlation of automatic measures with human judgements for this task.

   We estimate the correlation of unigram and Smoothed bleu , ter , rouge-su4 , and Meteor against human judgements on two data sets.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The main finding is that unigram bleu has a weak correlation, and Meteor has the strongest correlation with human judgements.
