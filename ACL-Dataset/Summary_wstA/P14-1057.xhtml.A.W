   A central challenge in semantic parsing is handling the myriad ways in which knowledge base predicates can be expressed.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Traditionally, semantic parsers are trained primarily from text paired with knowledge base information.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Our goal is to exploit the much larger amounts of raw text not tied to any knowledge base.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In this paper, we turn semantic parsing on its head.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Given an input utterance, we first use a simple method to deterministically generate a set of candidate logical forms with a canonical realization in natural language for each.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Then, we use a paraphrase model to choose the realization that best paraphrases the input, and output the corresponding logical form.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   We present two simple paraphrase models, an association model and a vector space model, and train them jointly from question-answer pairs.

   Our system ParaSempre improves state-of-the-art accuracies on two recently released question-answering datasets.
