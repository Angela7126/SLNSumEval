   This paper presents experiments with WordNet semantic classes to improve dependency parsing.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We study the effect of semantic classes in three dependency parsers, using two types of constituency-to-dependency conversions of the English Penn Treebank.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Overall, we can say that the improvements are small and not significant using automatic POS tags, contrary to previously published results using gold POS tags [].

   In addition, we explore parser combinations, showing that the semantically enhanced parsers yield a small significant gain only on the more semantically oriented LTH treebank conversion.
