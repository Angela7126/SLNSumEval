   Multi-document summarization (MDS) systems have been designed for short, unstructured summaries of 10-15 documents, and are inadequate for larger document collections.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We propose a new approach to scaling up summarization called hierarchical summarization , and present the first implemented system, Summa.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Summa produces a hierarchy of relatively short summaries, in which the top level provides a general overview and users can navigate the hierarchy to drill down for more details on topics of interest.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Summa optimizes for coherence as well as coverage of salient information.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   In an Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluation, users prefered Summa ten times as often as flat MDS and three times as often as timelines.
