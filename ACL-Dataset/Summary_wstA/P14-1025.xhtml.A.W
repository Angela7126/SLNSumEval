   We present experiments in using discourse structure for improving machine translation evaluation.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all-subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Then, we show that these measures can help improve a number of existing machine translation evaluation metrics both at the segment- and at the system-level.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Rather than proposing a single new metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, and thus should be taken into account in the development of future richer evaluation metrics.
