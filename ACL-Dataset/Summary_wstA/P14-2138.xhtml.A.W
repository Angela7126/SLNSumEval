   This paper demonstrates the importance of relation equivalence for entity translation pair discovery.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Existing approach of understanding relation equivalence has focused on using explicit features of co-occurring entities.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   In this paper, we explore latent features of temporality for understanding relation equivalence, and empirically show that the explicit and latent features complement each other.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Our proposed hybrid approach of using both explicit and latent features improves relation translation by 0.16 F1-score, and in turn improves entity translation by 0.02.
