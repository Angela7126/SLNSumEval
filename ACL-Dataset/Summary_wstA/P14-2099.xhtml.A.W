   In this paper we introduce a semantic role labeler for Korean, an agglutinative language with rich morphology.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   First, we create a novel training source by semantically annotating a Korean corpus containing fine-grained morphological and syntactic information.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We then develop a supervised SRL model by leveraging morphological features of Korean that tend to correspond with semantic roles.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Our model also employs a variety of latent morpheme representations induced from a larger body of unannotated Korean text.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   These elements lead to state-of-the-art performance of 81.07% labeled F1, representing the best SRL performance reported to date for an agglutinative language.
