   We propose a novel learning approach for statistical machine translation (SMT) that allows to extract supervision signals for structured learning from an extrinsic response to a translation input.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We show how to generate responses by grounding SMT in the task of executing a semantic parse of a translated query against a database.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Experiments on the Geoquery database show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for response-based learning over learning from references only on returning the correct answer from a semantic parse of a translated query.

   In general, our approach alleviates the dependency on human reference translations and solves the reachability problem in structured learning for SMT.
