       Accurately segmenting a citation string into fields for authors, titles, etc. is a challenging task because the output typically obeys various global constraints. Previous work has shown that modeling
       soft constraints
       , where the model is encouraged, but not require to obey the constraints, can substantially improve segmentation performance. On the other hand, for imposing
       hard constraints
       , dual decomposition is a popular technique for efficient prediction given existing algorithms for unconstrained inference. We extend dual decomposition to perform prediction subject to soft constraints. Moreover, with a technique for performing inference given soft constraints, it is easy to automatically generate large families of constraints and learn their costs with a simple convex optimization problem during training. This allows us to obtain substantial gains in accuracy on a new, challenging citation extraction dataset.

        Citation field extraction, an instance of information extraction, is the task of segmenting and labeling research paper citation strings into their constituent parts, including authors, editors, year, journal, volume, conference venue, etc. This task is important because citation data is often provided only in plain text; however, having an accurate structured database of bibliographic information is necessary for many scientometric tasks, such as mapping scientific sub-communities, discovering research trends, and analyzing networks of researchers. Automated citation field extraction needs further research because it has not yet reached a level of accuracy at which it can be practically deployed in real-world systems.

        Hidden Markov models and linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) have previously been applied to citation extraction
        [9, 14]
        . These models support efficient dynamic-programming inference, but only model
        local
        dependencies in the output label sequence. However citations have strong
        global
        regularities not captured by these models. For example many book citations contain both an
        author
        section and an
        editor
        section, but none have two disjoint
        author
        sections. Since linear-chain models are unable to capture more than Markov dependencies, the models sometimes mislabel the
        editor
        as a second author. If we could enforce the global constraint that there should be only one
        author
        section, accuracy could be improved.

        One framework for adding such global constraints into tractable models is
        constrained inference
        , in which at inference time the original model is augmented with restrictions on the outputs such that they obey certain global regularities. When hard constraints can be encoded as linear equations on the output variables, and the underlying model‚Äôs inference task can be posed as linear optimization, one can formulate this constrained inference problem as an
        integer linear program
        (ILP)
        [15]
        . Alternatively, one can employ
        dual decomposition
        [17]
        . Dual decompositions‚Äôs advantage over ILP is is that it can leverage existing inference algorithms for the original model as a black box. Such a modular algorithm is easy to implement, and works quite well in practice, providing certificates of optimality for most examples.

        The above two approaches have previously been applied to impose
        hard
        constraints on a model‚Äôs output. On the other hand, recent work has demonstrated improvements in citation field extraction by imposing
        soft
        constraints
        [4]
        . Here, the model is not required obey the global constraints, but merely pays a penalty for their violation.

        This paper introduces a novel method for imposing soft constraints via dual decomposition. We also propose a method for learning the penalties the prediction problem incurs for violating these soft constraints. Because our learning method drives many penalties to zero, it allows practitioners to perform ‚Äòconstraint selection,‚Äô in which a large number of automatically-generated candidate global constraints can be considered and automatically culled to a smaller set of useful constraints, which can be run quickly at test time.

        Using our new method, we are able to incorporate not only all the soft global constraints of Chang et al.
        [4]
        , but also far more complex data-driven constraints, while also providing stronger optimality certificates than their beam search technique. On a new, more broadly representative, and challenging citation field extraction data set, we show that our methods achieve a 17.9% reduction in error versus a linear-chain conditional random field. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our inference technique can use and benefit from the constraints of Chang et al.
        [4]
        , but that including our data-driven constraints on top of these is beneficial. While this paper focusses on an application to citation field extraction, the novel methods introduced here would easily generalize to many problems with global output regularities.

         The overall modeling technique we employ is to add soft constraints to a simple model for which we have an existing efficient prediction algorithm. For this underlying model, we employ a chain-structured conditional random field (CRF), since CRFs have been shown to perform better than other simple unconstrained models like hidden markov models for citation extraction
         [14]
         . We produce a prediction by performing

penalty for each unsatisfied constraint, proportional to the
amount by which it is violated. Therefore, our derivation parallels how
soft-margin SVMs are derived from hard-margin SVMs by introducing
auxiliary slack variables

        We consider the UMass citation dataset, first introduced in Anzaroot and McCallum
        [1]
        . It has over 1800 citation from many academic fields,
extracted from the arXiv. This dataset contains both coarse-grained
and fine-grained labels; for example it contains labels for the
segment of all authors, segments for each individual author, and
for the first and last name of each author. There are 660
citations in the development set and 367 citation in the test set.

BIO is a commonly used labeling schema for information extraction tasks. BIO labeling allows individual labels on tokens to label segmentation information as well as labels for the segments. In this schema, labels that begin segments are prepended with a
        B

Note these constraints are all
linear, since they depend only on the counts of each possible
conditional random field label. Moreover, since our labels are
BIO-encoded, it is possible, by counting B tags, to count how
often each citation tag itself appears in a sentence. The first two
families of constraints that we describe are general to any sequence
labeling task while the last is specific to hierarchical labeling

         We constrain the output labeling of the chain-structured CRF to be a valid BIO encoding. This both improves performance of the underlying model when used without global constraints, as well as ensures the validity of the global constraints we impose, since they operate only on
         B
         labels. The constraint that the labeling is valid BIO can be expressed as a collection of pairwise constraints on adjacent labels in the sequence. Rather than enforcing these constraints using dual decomposition, they can be enforced directly when performing MAP inference in the CRF by modifying the dynamic program of the Viterbi algorithm to only allow valid pairs of adjacent labels.

time, this can be computationally costly, specially if one is
considering very large constraint families. This is problematic because the size of some constraint families we consider grows quadratically with the number of candidate labels, and there are about 100 in the UMass dataset. Such a family consists of constraints that the sum of the
counts of two different label types has to be bounded (a useful
example is that there can‚Äôt be more than one out of ‚Äúphd

        There are multiple previous examples of augmenting chain-structured sequence models with terms capturing global relationships by expanding the chain to a more complex graphical model with non-local dependencies between the outputs. Inference in these models can be performed, for example, with loopy belief propagation
        [3, 22]
        or Gibbs sampling
        [8]
        . Belief propagation is prohibitively expensive in our model due to the high cardinalities of the output variables and of the global factors, which involve all output variables simultaneously. There are various methods for exploiting the combinatorial structure of these factors, but performance would still have higher complexity than our method. While Gibbs sampling has been shown to work well tasks such as named entity recognition
        [8]
        , our previous experiments show that it does not work well for citation extraction, where it found only low-quality solutions in practice because the sampling did not mix well, even on a simple chain-structured CRF.

        Recently, dual decomposition has become a popular method for solving complex structured prediction problems in NLP
        [12, 17, 18, 13, 5]
        . Soft constraints can be implemented inefficiently using hard constraints and dual decomposition‚Äî by introducing copies of output variables and an auxiliary graphical model, as in Rush et al.
        [16]
        . However, at every iteration of dual decomposition, MAP must be run in this auxiliary model. Furthermore the copying of variables doubles the number of iterations needed for information to flow between output variables, and thus slows convergence. On the other hand, our approach to soft constraints has identical per-iteration complexity as for hard constraints, and is a very easy modification to existing hard constraint code.

The global constraints added into the model are simply that each label only occurs once per citation. This approach is limited in its use of an HMM as an underlying model, as it has been shown that CRFs perform significantly better, achieving 95.37 token-level accuracy on CORA

In addition, we use a rule-based segmenter that segments the citation string based on punctuation as well as probable start or end segment words (e.g. ‚Äòin‚Äô and ‚Äòvolume‚Äô). We add a binary feature to tokens that correspond to the start of a segment in the output of this simple segmenter. This final feature improves the F1 score on the cleaned test set from 94.0 F1 to 94.44 F1, which we use as a baseline score.

        Table
        1
        shows how each type of constraint family improved the F1 score on the dataset. Learning all the constraints jointly provides the largest improvement in F1 at 95.39. This improvement in F1 over the baseline CRF as well as the improvement in F1 over using only-one constraints was shown to be statistically significant using the Wilcoxon signed rank test with p-values
        &lt;0.05
        . In the all-constraints settings, 32.96% of the constraints have a learned parameter of
        0
        , and therefore only 421 constraints are active.
Soft-DD converges, and thus solves the constrained inference problem exactly, for all test set examples after at most 41 iterations. Running Soft-DD to convergence requires 1.83 iterations on average per example. Since performing inference in the CRF is by far the most computationally intensive step in the iterative algorithm, this means our procedure requires approximately twice as much work as running the baseline CRF on the dataset. On examples where unconstrained inference does not satisfy the constraints, Soft-DD converges after 4.52 iterations on average. For 11.99% of the examples, the Soft-DD algorithm satisfies constraints that were not satisfied during unconstrained inference, while in the remaining 11.72% Soft-DD converges with some constraints left unsatisfied, which is possible since we are imposing them as soft constraints.

        We could have enforced these constraints as hard constraints rather than soft ones. This experiment is shown in the last row of Table
        1
        , where F1 only improves to 94.6. In addition, running the DD algorithm with these constraints takes 5.21 iterations on average per example, which is 2.8 times slower than Soft-DD with learned penalties.

        In Figure

        , we analyze the performance of Soft-DD when we don‚Äôt necessarily run it to convergence, but stop after a fixed number of iterations on each test set example. We find that a large portion of our gain in accuracy can be obtained when we allow ourselves as few as 2 dual decomposition iterations. However, this only amounts to 1.24 times as much work as running the baseline CRF on the dataset, since the constraints are satisfied immediately for many examples.

        We train and evaluate on the UMass dataset instead of CORA, because it is significantly larger, has a useful finer-grained labeling schema, and its annotation is more consistent. We were able to obtain better performance on CORA using our baseline CRF than the

        results presented in Chang et al.
        [4]
        , which include soft constraints. Given this high performance of our base model on CORA, we did not apply our Soft-DD algorithm to the dataset. Furthermore, since the dataset is so small, learning the penalties for our large collection of constraints is difficult, and test set results are unreliable. Rather than compare our work to Chang et al.

        via results on CORA, we apply their constraints on the UMass data using Soft-DD and demonstrate accuracy gains, as discussed above.

         We now describe a number of the useful constraints that receive non-zero learned penalties and have high importance scores, defined in Section
         5.6

         The above example constraints are almost always satisfied on the ground truth, and would be useful to enforce as hard constraints. However, there are a number of learned constraints that are often violated on the ground truth but are still useful as soft constraints.
Take, for example, the constraint that the number of
         number
         segments does not exceed the number of
         booktitle
         segments, as well as the constraint that it does not exceed the number of
         journal
         segments. These constraints are moderately violated on ground truth examples, however. For example, when
         booktitle
         segments co-occur with
         number
         segments but not with
         journal
         segments, the second constraint is violated. It is still useful to impose these soft constraints, as strong evidence from the CRF allows us to violate them, and they can guide the model to good predictions when the CRF is unconfident.
