      <p class="ltx_p">
       We present a method to jointly learn features and weights directly from distributional data in a log-linear framework. Specifically, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for learning phonological markedness constraints directly from the distribution of input-output mappings in an Optimality Theory (OT) setting. The model uses an Indian Buffet Process prior to learn the feature values used in the log-linear method, and is the first algorithm for learning phonological constraints without presupposing constraint structure.
The model learns a system of constraints that explains observed data as well as the phonologically-grounded constraints of a standard analysis, with a violation structure corresponding to the standard constraints. These results suggest an alternative data-driven source for constraints instead of a fully innate constraint set.

        Many aspects of human cognition involve the interaction of constraints that push a decision-maker toward different options, whether in something so trivial as choosing a movie or so important as a fight-or-flight response. These constraint-driven decisions can be modeled with a log-linear system. In these models, a set of constraints is weighted and their violations are used to determine a probability distribution over outcomes. But where do these constraints come from?

        We consider this question by examining the dominant framework in modern phonology, Optimality Theory

        , implemented in a log-linear framework, MaxEnt OT

        , with output forms‚Äô probabilities based on a weighted sum of constraint violations. OT analyses generally assume that the constraints are innate and universal, both to obviate the problem of learning constraints‚Äô identities and to limit the set of possible languages.

        We propose a new approach: to learn constraints with limited innate phonological knowledge by identifying sets of constraint violations that explain the observed distributional data, instead of selecting constraints from an innate set of constraint definitions. Because the constraints are identified as sets of violations, this also permits constraints specific to a given language to be learned. This method, which we call IBPOT, uses an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior to define the space of possible constraint violation matrices, and uses Bayesian reasoning to identify constraint matrices likely to have generated the observed data.
In identifying constraints solely by their extensional violation profiles, this method does not directly identify the intensional definitions of the identified constraints, but to the extent that the resulting violation profiles are phonologically interpretable, we may conclude that the data themselves guide constraint identification.
We test IBPOT on tongue-root vowel harmony in Wolof, a West African language.

        The set of constraints learned by the model satisfy two major goals: they explain the data as well as the standard phonological analysis, and their violation structures correspond to the standard constraints. This suggests an alternative data-driven genesis for constraints, rather than the traditional assumption of fully innate constraints.

         Optimality Theory has been used for constraint-based analysis of many areas of language, but we focus on its most successful application: phonology. We consider an OT analysis of the mappings between underlying forms and their phonological manifestations ‚Äì i.e., mappings between forms in the mental lexicon and the actual vocalized forms of the words.

         Stated generally, an OT system takes some input, generates a set of candidate outputs, determines what constraints each output violates, and then selects a candidate output with a relatively unobjectionable violation profile. To do this, an OT system contains four major components: a generator
         Gen
         , which generates candidate output forms for the input; a set of constraints
         Con
         , which penalize candidates; a evaluation method
         Eval
         , which selects an winning candidate; and
         H
         , a language-particular weighting of constraints that
         Eval
         uses to determine the winning candidate.
Previous OT work has focused on identifying the appropriate formulation of
         Eval
         and the values and acquisition of
         H
         , while taking
         Gen

Unlike previous OT learning methods, which assume known constraint definitions and only learn the relative strength of these constraints, the IBPOT learns constraint violation profiles and weights for them simultaneously. The constraints are derived from sets of violations that effectively explain the observed data, rather than being selected from a pre-existing set of possible constraints.

         Although all OT systems share the same core structure, different choices of
         Eval
         lead to different behaviors. In IBPOT, we use the log-linear
         Eval
         developed by
         in their MaxEnt OT system. MEOT extends traditional OT to account for variation (cases in which multiple candidates can be the winner), as well as gradient/probabilistic productions
         []
         and other constraint interactions (e.g., cumulativity) that traditional OT cannot handle
         []
         . MEOT also is motivated by the general MaxEnt framework, whereas most other OT formulations are ad hoc constructions specific to phonology.

         fi‚Å¢(y,x)

         This formulation represents a probabilistic extension of the traditional formulation of OT
         []
         . Traditionally, constraints form a strict hierarchy, where a single violation of a high-ranked constraint is worse than any number of violations of lower-ranked constraints. Traditional OT is also deterministic, with the optimal candidate always selected. In MEOT, the constraint weights define hierarchies of varying strictness, and some probability is assigned to all candidates. If constraints‚Äô weights are close together, multiple violations of lower-weighted constraints can reduce a candidate‚Äôs probability below that of a competitor with a single high-weight violation. As the distance between weights in MEOT increases, the probability of a suboptimal candidate being chosen approaches zero; thus the traditional formulation is a limit case of MEOT.

         Ete and

         is innate and universal. But in the absence of direct evidence of innate constraints, we should prefer a method that can derive the constraints from cognitively-general learning over one that assumes they are pre-specified.

This version allows language-particular constraints, but it comes with a computational cost, as the learner must be able to generate and evaluate possible constraints while learning the language‚Äôs phonology. Even with relatively simple constraint templates, such as the phonological constraint learner of Hayes and Wilson
         []
         , the number of possible constraints expands exponentially. Depending on the specific formulation of the constraints, the constraint identification problem may even be NP-hard
         []
         . Our approach of casting the learning problem as one of identifying violation profiles is an attempt to determine the amount that can be learned about the active constraints in a paradigm without hypothesizing intensional constraint definitions.
The violation profile information used by our model could then be used to narrow the search space for intensional constraints, either by performing post-hoc analysis of the constraints identified by our model or by combining intensional constraint search into the learning process.

         To establish performance for the phonological standard, we use the IBPOT learner to find constraint weights but do not update
         M
         . The resultant learner is essentially MaxEnt OT with the weights estimated through Metropolis sampling instead of gradient ascent. This is done so that the IBPOT weights and phonological standard weights are learned by the same process and can be compared. We use the same parameters for this baseline as for the IBPOT tests. The results in this section are based on nine runs each of IBPOT and MEOT; ten MEOT runs were performed but one failed to converge and was removed from analysis.

         A successful set of learned constraints will satisfy two criteria: achieving good data likelihood (no worse than the phonological-standard constraints) and acquiring constraint violation profiles that are phonologically interpretable. We find that both of these criteria are met by IBPOT on Wolof.

          Our second criterion is the acquisition of meaningful constraints, that is, ones whose violation profiles have phonologically-grounded explanations. IBPOT learns the same number of markedness constraints as the phonological standard (two); over the final 1000 iterations of the model runs,

          For instance, the strongest learned markedness constraint, shown as
          M1
          in Figure
          2
          , has the same violations as the top-ranked constraint that actively distinguishes between candidates in each paradigm. For the five paradigms with at least one high vowel (the top row and left column),
          M1
          has the same violations as
          *I
          , as
          *I
          penalizes some but not all of the candidates. In the other four paradigms,
          *I
          penalizes none of the candidates, and the IBPOT learner has no reason to learn it. Instead, it learns that
          M1
          has the same violations as
          Harmony
          , which is the highest-weighted constraint that distinguishes between candidates in these paradigms. Thus in the high-vowel paradigms,
          M1
          serves as
          *I
          , while in the low/mid-vowel paradigms, it serves as

          The lower-weighted

          makes some values of
          M2
          inconsequential. Consider the top-left paradigm of Figure
          2

          M1
          (

          M1

          M2

          The meaning of

          M2
          matches
          Harmony
          , and the learned and standard constraints agree on all consequential violations, despite being essentially at chance on the indistinguishable violations (58%). On the non-high paradigms, the meaning of
          M2
          is unclear, as
          Harmony
          is handled by
          M1

          *I
          is unviolated. In all four paradigms, the model learns that the RTR-RTR candidate violates
          M2
          and the ATR-ATR candidate does not; this appears to be the model‚Äôs attempt to reinforce a pattern in the lowest-ranked faithfulness constraint (
          Parse
          [atr]), which the ATR-ATR candidate never violates.

          Thus, while the IBPOT constraints are not identical to the phonologically standard ones, they reflect a version of the standard constraints that is consistent with the IBPOT framework.
          In paradigms where each markedness constraint distinguishes candidates, the learned constraints match the standard constraints. In paradigms where only one constraint distinguishes candidates, the top learned constraint matches it and the second learned constraint exhibits a pattern consistent with a low-ranked faithfulness constraint.

        Relation to phonotactic learning
       </h3>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S5.SS1.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         Our primary finding from IBPOT is that it is possible to identify constraints that are both effective at explaining the data and representative of theorized phonologically-grounded constraints, given only input-output mappings and faithfulness violations. Furthermore, these constraints are successfully acquired without any knowledge of the phonological structure of the data beyond the faithfulness violation profiles. The model‚Äôs ability to infer constraint violation profiles without theoretical constraint structure provides an alternative solution to the problems of the traditionally innate and universal OT constraint set.

         As it jointly learns constraints and weights, the IBPOT model calls to mind Hayes and Wilson‚Äôs
         []
         joint phonotactic learner. Their learner also jointly learns weights and constraints, but directly selects its constraints from a compositional grammar of constraint definitions. This limits their learner in practice by the rapid explosion in the number of constraints as the maximum constraint definition size grows. By directly learning violation profiles, the IBPOT model avoids this explosion, and the violation profiles can be automatically parsed to identify the constraint definitions that are consistent with the learned profile. The inference method of the two models is different as well; the phonotactic learner selects constraints greedily, whereas the sampling on
         M
         in IBPOT asymptotically approaches the posterior.

         The two learners also address related but different phonological problems. The phonotactic learner considers phonotactic problems, in which only output matters. The constraints learned by Hayes and Wilson‚Äôs learner are essentially OT markedness constraints, but their learner does not have to account for varied inputs or effects of faithfulness constraints.

        Extending the learning model

        <p class="ltx_p">
         IBPOT, as proposed here, learns constraints based on binary violation profiles, defined extensionally. A complete model of constraint acquisition should provide intensional definitions that are phonologically grounded and cover potentially non-binary constraints. We discuss how to extend the model toward these goals.
        </p>

        <p class="ltx_p">
         IBPOT currently learns extensional constraints, defined by which candidates do or do not violate the constraint. Intensional definitions are needed to extend constraints to unseen forms. Post hoc violation profile analysis, as in Sect.
         4.3
         , provides a first step toward this goal. Such analysis can be integrated into the learning process using the Rational Rules model
         []
         to identify likely constraint definitions compositionally. Alternately, phonological knowledge could be integrated into a joint constraint learning process in the form of a naturalness bias on the constraint weights or a phonologically-motivated replacement for the IBP prior.

         The results presented here use binary constraints, where each candidate violates each constraint only once, a result of the IBP‚Äôs restriction to binary matrices. Non-binarity can be handled by using the binary matrix
         M
         to indicate whether a candidate violates a constraint, with a second distribution determining the number of violations.
Alternately, a binary matrix can directly capture non-binary constraints;
         converted existing non-binary constraints into a binary OT system by representing non-binary constraints as a set of equally-weighted overlapping constraints, each accounting for one violation. The non-binary harmony constraint, for instance, becomes a set {*(at least one disharmony), *(at least two disharmonies), etc.}.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         Lastly, the Wolof vowel harmony problem provides a test case with overlaps in the candidate sets for different inputs. This candidate overlap helps the model find appropriate constraint structures. Analyzing other phenomena may require the identification of appropriate abstractions to find this same structural overlap. English regular plurals, for instance, fall into broad categories depending on the features of the stem-final phoneme. IBPOT learning in such settings may require learning an appropriate abstraction as well.
