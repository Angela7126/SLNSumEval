      </h6>
      <p class="ltx_p">
       We study the use of temporal information in the form of timelines to enhance multi-document summarization.
We employ a fully automated temporal processing system to generate a timeline for each input document.
We derive three features from these timelines, and show that their use in supervised summarization lead to a significant 4.1% improvement in ROUGE performance over a state-of-the-art baseline.
In addition, we propose
       TimeMMR
       , a modification to Maximal Marginal Relevance that promotes temporal diversity by way of
computing time span similarity, and show its utility in summarizing certain document sets.
We also propose a filtering metric to discard noisy timelines generated by our automatic processes, to purify the timeline input for summarization.
By selectively using timelines guided by filtering, overall summarization performance is increased by a significant 5.9%.

       Introduction
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        There has been a good amount of research invested into improving the temporal interpretation of text.
Besides the increasing availability of annotation standards (e.g.,
        TimeML
        [21]
        ) and corpora (e.g., TIDES
        [9]
        , TimeBank
        [22]
        ),
the community has also organized three successful evaluation workshops — TempEval-1
        [25]
        , -2
        [26]
        , and -3
        [24]
        .
As the state-of-the-art improves, these workshops have moved away from the piecemeal evaluation of individual temporal processing tasks and towards the evaluation of complete end-to-end systems in TempEval-3.
We believe our understanding of the temporal information found in text is sufficiently robust, and that there is an opportunity to now leverage this information in downstream applications.
In this paper, we present our work in incorporating the use of such temporal information into multi-document summarization.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        The goal of multi-document summarization is to generate a summary which includes the main points from an input collection of documents with minimal repetition of similar points.
We hope to improve the quality of the summaries that are generated by considering temporal information found in the input text.
To motivate how temporal information can be useful in summarization, let us refer to Figure
        1
        .
The three sentences describe a recent cyclone and a previous one which happened in 1991. Recognizing that sentence (3) is about a storm that had happened in the past is important when writing a summary about the recent storm, as it is not relevant and can likely be excluded.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        It is reasonable to expect that a collection of documents about the recent storm will contain more references to it, compared with the earlier one that happened in 1991.
Visualized on a timeline, this will translate to more events (bolded in Figure
        1
        ) around the time when the recent storm occurred.
There should be fewer events mentioned in the collection for the earlier 1991 time period.
Figure
        2
        illustrates a possible timeline laid out with the events found in Figure
        1
        .
The events from the more recent storm are found together at the same time.
There are fewer events which talk about the previous storm.
Thus, temporal information does assist in identifying which sentences are more relevant to the final summary.

        Our work is significant as it addresses an important gap in the exploitation of temporal information.
While there has been prior work making use of temporal information for multi-document summarization, they 1) have been largely confined to helping to chronologically order content within summaries
        [2]
        , or 2) focus only on the use of recency as an indicator of saliency
        [10, 27]
        .
In this work we construct timelines (as a representation of temporal information) automatically and incorporate them into a state-of-the-art multi-document summarization system.
This is achieved with 1) three novel features derived from timelines to help measure the saliency of sentences, as well as 2)
        TimeMMR
        , a modification to the traditional Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)
        [3]
        .
TimeMMR promotes diversity by additionally considering temporal information instead of just lexical similarities.
Through these, we demonstrate that temporal information is useful for multi-document summarization.
Compared to a competitive baseline, significant improvements of up to 4.1% are obtained.

        Automatic temporal processing systems are not perfect yet, and this may have an impact on their use for downstream applications.
This work additionally proposes the use of the lengths of timelines as a metric to gauge the usefulness of timelines.
Together with the earlier described contributions, this metric further improves summarization, yielding an overall 5.9% performance increase.

        Barzilay et al. (1999)
        were one of the first to use time for multi-document summarization.
They recognized the importance of generating a summary which presents the time perspective of the summarized documents correctly.
They estimated the chronological ordering of events with a small set of heuristics, and also made use of lexical patterns to perform basic time normalization on terms like “today” relative to the document creation time.
The induced ordering is used to present the selected summary content, following the chronological order in the original documents.

        Goldstein et al. (2000)
        made use of the temporal ordering of documents to be summarized.
In computing the relevance of a passage for inclusion into the final summary, they considered the recency of the passage’s source document.
Passages from more recent documents are deemed to be more important.
        Wan (2007)

        Demartini et al. (2010)

        Instead of just considering the notion of recency,
        Liu et al. (2009)
        proposed an interesting approach using a temporal graph.
Events within a document set correspond to vertices in their proposed graph, while edges are determined by the temporal ordering of events.
From the resulting weakly-connected graph, the largest forests are assumed to contain key topics within the document set and used to influence a scoring mechanism which prefers sentences touching on these topics.

        Wu (2008)
        also made use of the relative ordering of events.
He assigned complete timestamps to events extracted from text.
After laying out these events onto a timeline by making use of these timestamps, the number of events that
happen within the same day is used to influence sentence scoring.
The motivation behind this approach is that days which have a large number of events should be more important and more worthy of reporting than others.

        These prior works target either 1) sentence re-ordering, or 2) the use of recency as an indicator of saliency.
In sentence re-ordering, final summaries are re-arranged so that the extracted sentences that form the summary are in a chronological order.
We argue that this may not be appropriate for all summaries.
Depending on the style of writing or journalistic guidelines, a summary can arguably be written in a number of ways.
The use of recency as an indicator of saliency is useful, yet disregards other accessible temporal information.
If a summary of a whole sequence of events is desired, recency becomes less useful.

        The work of
        Wu (2008)
        is closely related to one of the features proposed in this paper.
He had also made use of temporal information to weight sentences to generate summaries.
However his approach is guided by the number of events happening within the same time span, and relies on event co-referencing.
In this work, we have simplified this idea by dropping the need for event co-referencing (removing a source of propagated error), and augmented it with two additional features derived from timelines.
By doing so, we are able to make better use of the available temporal information, taking into account all known events and the time in which they occur.

        A useful note here is that this work is arguably different from the Temporal Summarization (TmpSum) track at the Text Retrieval Conference
        [1]
        .
Given a large stream of data in real-time, the purpose of the TmpSum track is to look out for a query event, and retrieve specific details about the event over a period of time.
Systems are also expected to identify the source sentences from which these details are retrieved.
This is not the same as our approach here, which makes use of temporal information encoded in timelines to generate prose summaries.

        Temporal Processing
        generates timelines from text, one for each input document.
Timelines are well-understood constructs which have often been used to represent temporal information
        [7, 8]
        .
They indicate the temporal relationships between two basic temporal units: 1) events, and 2) time expressions (or timexes for short).
In this work, we adopt the definitions proposed in the standardized
        TimeML
        annotation
        [21]
        .
An event refers to an eventuality, a situation that occurs or an action; while
a timex is a reference to a particular date or time (e.g. “
        2013 December 31
        ”).

        Summarization.
        We make use of a state-of-the-art summarization system,
        SWING
        [16]
        (bottom half of Figure
        3

        SWING
        is a supervised, extractive summarization system which ranks sentences based on scores computed using a set of features in the
        Sentence Scoring
        phase. The Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm is then used in the
        Sentence Re-ordering
        phase to re-order and select sentences to form the final summary.
The timelines built in the earlier temporal processing can be incorporated into this pipeline by deriving a set of features used to score sentences in
        Sentence Scoring
        , and as input to the MMR algorithm when computing similarity in
        Sentence Re-ordering

The arrowed, horizontal axis is the timeline itself.
The timeline can be viewed as a continuum of time, with points on the timeline referring to specific moments of time.
Small solid blocks on the timeline itself are references to absolute timestamps along the timeline (e.g., “

Generalizing, we refer to the time period an event takes place in as its
         time span
         (vertical dotted lines).
As a simplifying assumption, events are laid out on the timeline based on the starting time of their time span.
Note that in our work, time spans may not correspond to specific instances of time, but instead help in inferring an ordering of events.
Events which appear to the left of others take place earlier, while events within the same time span happen together over the same time period.

         We hypothesize that when more events happen within a particular time span, that time span is potentially more relevant for summarization.
Sentences that mention events found in such a time span should be assigned higher scores.
Referring to Figure

         The importance of a time span may not depend solely on the number of events that happen within it.
If it is near time spans which are “important” (i.e., one that has a large number of events), it should also be of relative importance.
A more concrete illustration of this can also be seen in Figure

         T⁢Sl⁢p

The contribution of each peak to the weighted sum is decayed by its distance from

         3. Sentence Temporal Coverage Density (TCD).
         We first define the
         temporal coverage
         of a sentence.
This corresponds to the number of time spans that the events in a sentence talk about.
Suppose a sentence contains events which are associated with time spans
         T⁢Sa
         ,
         T⁢Sb
         ,
         T⁢Sc
         .
The time spans are ordered in the sequence they appear on the timeline.
Then the temporal coverage of a sentence is defined as the number of time spans between the earliest time span
         T⁢Sa
         and the latest time span
         T⁢Sc
         .
Referring to Figure
         4
         , suppose a sentence contains the three events which have been shaded black. The temporal coverage in this case includes all the time spans from time span
         A
         to time span
         A+4
         , inclusive.

        <p class="ltx_p">
         The constraint on the number of sentences that can be included in a summary requires us to select compact sentences which contain as many relevant facts as possible.
Traditional lexical measures may attempt to achieve this by computing the ratio of keyphrases to the number of words in a sentence

Stated equivalently, when two sentences are of the same length, if one contains more keyphrases, it should contain more useful facts.
TCD parallels this idea with the use of temporal information, i.e. if two sentences are of the same temporal coverage, then the one with more events should carry more useful facts.

         In the sentence re-ordering stage of the

In each iteration,
         s
         is penalized if it is lexically similar to other sentences that have already been selected to form the eventual summary

The motivating idea is to reduce repeated information by preferring sentences which bring in new facts.

In Figure

They describe the destruction caused by a hurricane with trees uprooted and buildings blown away.
A summary about the hurricane need not contain all of these sentences as they are all describing the same thing.
However it is not trivial for the lexically-motivated MMR algorithm to detect that events like “
         passed
         ”, “
         uprooted
         ” or “
         damaged

         Temporal processing is imperfect.
Together with the simplifying assumptions that were made in timeline construction, our generated timelines have errors which propagate into the summarization process.
With this in mind, we selectively employ timelines to generate summaries only when we are confident of their accuracy.
This can be done by computing a metric which can be used to decide whether or not timelines should be used for a particular input document collection.

The intuition for this is that for longer timelines (which contain more events), possible errors are spread over the entire timeline, and do not overpower any useful signal that can be obtained from the timeline features outlined earlier.
Errors are however very easily propagated into summary generation for shorter timelines, leading to less useful results.

Since the focus of this paper is on multi-document summarization, we employ only the three generic features, i.e., 1) sentence position, 2) sentence length, and 3) interpolated n-gram document frequency in our experiments below.

number of document sets where temporal information is used is reduced.
This suggests that filtering is successful in identifying timelines that are not sufficiently accurate to be useful for summarization.
R-2 performance peaks around a threshold of 40.
This affirms our use of the average length of timelines as the threshold value in our earlier experiments.
Beyond 60, the R-2 scores are still higher than that obtained by

At these higher thresholds, temporal information is still able to help get an improvement in R-2.
