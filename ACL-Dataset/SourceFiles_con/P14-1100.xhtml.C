       Abstract
      </h6>
      <p class="ltx_p">
       We propose a spectral approach for unsupervised constituent parsing that comes with theoretical guarantees on latent structure recovery. Our approach is grammarless ‚Äì we directly learn the bracketing structure of a given sentence without using a grammar model. The main algorithm is based on lifting the concept of additive tree metrics for structure learning of latent trees in the phylogenetic and machine learning communities to the case where the tree structure varies across examples. Although finding the ‚Äúminimal‚Äù latent tree is NP-hard in general, for the case of projective trees we find that it can be found using bilexical parsing algorithms. Empirically, our algorithm performs favorably compared to the constituent context model of Klein and Manning (2002) without the need for careful initialization.

        Solutions to the problem of grammar induction have been long sought after since the early days of computational linguistics and are interesting both from cognitive and engineering perspectives. Cognitively, it is more plausible to assume that children obtain only terminal strings of parse trees and not the actual parse trees. This means the unsupervised setting is a better model for studying language acquisition. From the engineering perspective, training data for unsupervised parsing exists in abundance (i.e. sentences and part-of-speech tags), and is much cheaper than the syntactically annotated data required for supervised training.

        Most existing solutions treat the problem of unsupervised parsing by assuming a generative process over parse trees e.g. probabilistic context free grammars
        [Jelinek et al.1992]
        , and the constituent context model
        [Klein and Manning2002]
        . Learning then reduces to finding a set of parameters that are estimated by identifying a local maximum of an objective function such as the likelihood
        [Klein and Manning2002]
        or a variant of it
        [Smith and Eisner2005, Cohen and Smith2009, Headden et al.2009, Spitkovsky et al.2010b, Gillenwater et al.2010, Golland et al.2012]
        . Unfortunately, finding the global maximum for these objective functions is usually intractable
        [Cohen and Smith2012]
        which often leads to severe local optima problems (but see Gormley and Eisner, 2013
        ). Thus, strong experimental results are often achieved by initialization techniques
        [Klein and Manning2002, Gimpel and Smith2012]
        , incremental dataset use
        [Spitkovsky et al.2010a]
        and other specialized techniques to avoid local optima such as count transforms
        [Spitkovsky et al.2013]
        . These approaches, while empirically promising, generally lack theoretical justification.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        On the other hand, recently proposed spectral methods approach the problem via restriction of the PCFG model
        [Hsu et al.2012]
        or matrix completion
        [Bailly et al.2013]
        . These novel perspectives offer strong theoretical guarantees but are not designed to achieve competitive empirical results.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        In this paper, we suggest a different approach, to provide a first step to bridging this theory-experiment gap. More specifically, we approach unsupervised constituent parsing from the perspective of
        structure learning
        as opposed to parameter learning. We associate each sentence with an undirected latent tree graphical model, which is a tree consisting of both observed variables (corresponding to the words in the sentence) and an additional set of latent variables that are unobserved in the data. This undirected latent tree is then directed via a
        direction mapping
        to give the final constituent parse.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p5">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        In our framework, parsing reduces to finding the best latent structure for a given sentence. However, due to the presence of latent variables, structure learning of latent trees is substantially more complicated than in observed models. As before, one solution would be local search heuristics.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p6">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Intuitively, however, latent tree models encode low rank dependencies among the observed variables permitting the development of ‚Äúspectral‚Äù methods that can lead to provably correct solutions. In particular we leverage the concept of additive tree metrics
        [Buneman1971, Buneman1974]
        in phylogenetics and machine learning that can create a special distance metric among the observed variables as a function of the underlying spectral dependencies
        [Choi et al.2011, Song et al.2011, Anandkumar et al.2011, Ishteva et al.2012]
        . Additive tree metrics can be leveraged by ‚Äúmeta-algorithms‚Äù such as neighbor-joining
        [Saitou and Nei1987]
        and recursive grouping
        [Choi et al.2011]
        to provide consistent learning algorithms for latent trees.

      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p7">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Moreover, we show that it is desirable to learn the ‚Äúminimal‚Äù latent tree based on the tree metric (‚Äúminimum evolution‚Äù in phylogenetics). While this criterion is in general NP-hard
        [Desper and Gascuel2005]
        , for projective trees we find that a bilexical parsing algorithm can be used to find an exact solution efficiently
        [Eisner and Satta1999]

        Unlike in phylogenetics and graphical models, where a single latent tree is constructed for all the data, in our case, each part of speech sequence is associated with its own parse tree. This leads to a severe data sparsity problem even for moderately long sentences. To handle this issue, we present a strategy that is inspired by ideas from kernel smoothing in the statistics community
        [Zhou et al.2010, Kolar et al.2010b, Kolar et al.2010a]
        . This allows principled sharing of samples from different but similar underlying distributions.

        We provide theoretical guarantees on the recovery of the correct underlying latent tree and characterize the associated sample complexity under our technique. Empirically we evaluate our method on data in English, German and Chinese. Our algorithm performs favorably to Klein and Manning‚Äôs (2002) constituent-context model (CCM), without the need for careful initialization. In addition, we also analyze CCM‚Äôs sensitivity to initialization, and compare our results to Seginer‚Äôs algorithm

         be a vector of words corresponding to a sentence of length
         ‚Ñì

         .
In addition, let
         ùíô=(x1,‚Ä¶,x‚Ñì)

a bracketing parse tree for each of these examples. The word embeddings are used during the learning process, but the final decoder that the learning algorithm outputs
maps a POS tag sequence
         ùíô
         to a parse tree. While ideally we would want to use the word information in decoding as well, much of the syntax of a sentence
is determined by the POS tags, and relatively high level of accuracy can be achieved by learning, for example, a supervised parser from POS tag sequences.

parse tree generate the words of the sentence (in the form of embeddings). The latent states are represented by vectors

        Intuition
       </h3>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS2.p1">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         For intuition, consider the simple tag sequence
         ùíô=(ùöÖùô±ùô≥,ùô≥ùöÉ,ùôΩùôΩ)
         .
Two candidate constituent parse structures are shown in Figure
         2
         and the correct one is boxed in green (the other in red).
Recall that our training data contains word phrases that have the tag sequence
         ùíô
         e.g.
         ùíò(1)=(ùöëùöíùöù,ùöùùöëùöé,ùöãùöäùöïùöï)
         ,
         ùíò(2)=(ùöäùöùùöé,ùöäùöó,ùöäùöôùöôùöïùöé)
         .
        </p>
       </div>
       <div class="ltx_para" id="S2.SS2.p2">
        <p class="ltx_p">
         Intuitively, the words in the above phrases exhibit dependencies that can reveal the parse structure. The determiner (
         w2
         ) and the direct object (
         w3
         ) are correlated in that the choice of determiner depends on the plurality of
         w3
         . However, the choice of verb (
         w1
         ) is mostly independent of the determiner. We could thus conclude that
         w2
         and
         w3
         should be closer in the parse tree than
         w1
         and
         w2
         , giving us the correct structure. Informally, the latent state
         z
         corresponding to the
         (w2,w3)
         bracket would store information about the plurality of
         z
         , the key to the dependence between
         w2
         and
         w3
         . It would then be reasonable to assume that
         w2
         and
         w3
         are independent given
         z

Our learning algorithm focuses on recovering the undirected tree based for the generative model that was described above. This undirected tree

As implied by the above definition of

          , selecting which edge is the root can be interpreted as determining the top bracket of the constituent parse.
For example, in Figure

          ([1,2],[3,5])=([ùô≥ùöÉ,ùôΩùôΩ],[ùöÖùô±ùô≥,ùô≥ùöÉ,ùôΩùôΩ])

        If all the variables were observed, then the Chow-Liu algorithm

What is needed is a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù distance function that allows us to reverse engineer the distances among the latent variables given the distances among the observed variables. This is the key idea behind additive tree metrics that are the basis of our approach.

is in the form of the above assumption. If

         m
         .
Assumption
         1
         allows for the
         wi
         to be high dimensional features, as long as the expectation requirement above is satisfied.

         Bailly et al.2009

         Furthermore, Assumption
         1
         makes it explicit that regardless of the size of
         p
         , the relationships among the variables in the latent tree are restricted to be of rank
         m
         , and are thus
         low rank
         since
         p&gt;m

To leverage this low rank structure, we propose using the following additive metric, a normalized variant of that in

         Summary.
         We first defined a generative model that describes how a sentence, its sequence of POS tags, and its bracketing is generated (¬ß
         2.3
         ).
First an undirected
         u‚ààùí∞
         is generated (only as a function of the POS tags), and then
         u
         is mapped to a bracketing using a direction mapping
         hdir
         . We then showed that we can define a distance metric between nodes in the undirected tree, such that minimizing
it leads to a recovery of
         u
         . This distance metric can be computed based only on the text, without needing to identify the latent information (¬ß
         3.2
         ).
If the true distance metric is known, with respect to the true distribution that generates the words in a sentence, then
         u
         can be fully recovered
by optimizing the cost function
         c‚Å¢(u)
         . However, in practice the distance metric must be estimated from data, as discussed below.

         ùíô=(ùô≥ùöÉùü∑,ùôΩùôΩùü∏,ùöÖùô±ùô≥ùüπ,ùô≥ùöÉùü∫,ùôΩùôΩùüª)

         ùíü‚Å¢(ùíô)
         may be insufficient for an accurate empirical estimate. However, consider another sequence

         is similar to
         ùö∫ùíô‚Å¢(1,2)
         because the determiner and the noun appear in similar syntactic context.
         ùö∫ùíô‚Ä≤‚Å¢(5,7)
         also may be somewhat similar,
but
         ùö∫ùíô‚Ä≤‚Å¢(2,7)
         should not be very similar to
         ùö∫ùíô‚Å¢(1,2)

         The observation that the covariance matrices depend on local syntactic context is the main driving force behind our solution. The local syntactic context acts as an ‚Äúanchor,‚Äù which
enhances or replaces a word index in a sentence with local syntactic context.
More formally, an anchor is a function
         G
         that maps a word index
         j
         and a sequence of POS tags
         ùíô
         to a local context
         G‚Å¢(j,ùíô)
         . The anchor we use
is
         G‚Å¢(j,ùíô)=(j,xj)
         . Then, the covariance matrices
         ùö∫ùíô
         are estimated using kernel smoothing
         [Hastie et al.2009]
         , where the smoother
tests similarity between the different anchors
         G‚Å¢(j,ùíô)

         The full learning algorithm is given in Figure
         3.3
         . The first step in the algorithm is to estimate the covariance matrix block
         ùö∫^ùíô(i)‚Å¢(j,k)
         for each
training example
         ùíô(i)

         (j,k)
         in
         ùíô(i)
         . Instead of computing this block by computing the empirical covariance matrix for positions
         (j,k)
         in
the data
         ùíü‚Å¢(ùíô)
         , the algorithm uses all of the pairs
         (j‚Ä≤,k‚Ä≤)
         from all of
         N
         training examples. It averages the empirical covariance matrices from these contexts using a kernel
weight, which gives a similarity measure for the position
         (j,k)
         in
         ùíô(i)

         (j‚Ä≤,k‚Ä≤)

         Œ≥
         is the kernel ‚Äúbandwidth‚Äù, a user-specified parameter that controls how inclusive the kernel will be with respect to examples in
         ùíü
         (see ¬ß
         4.1
         for a concrete example). Note that the learning algorithm is such that it ensures that
         ùö∫^ùíô(i)‚Å¢(j,k)=ùö∫^ùíô(i‚Ä≤)‚Å¢(j‚Ä≤,k‚Ä≤)
         if

          As mentioned earlier, each

          can be an arbitrary feature vector. For all languages we use Brown clustering
          [Brown et al.1992]
          to construct a
          log‚Å°(C)+C
          feature vector where the first
          log‚Å°(C)
          elements indicate which mergable cluster the word belongs to, and the last
          C
          elements indicate the cluster identity. For English, more sophisticated word embeddings are easily obtainable, and we experiment with neural word embeddings
          Turian et al.2010
          of length 50. We also explored two types of CCA embeddings: OSCCA and TSCCA, given in
          Dhillon et al.2012

          For CCM, we found that if the full dataset (all sentence lengths) is used in training, then performance degrades when evaluating on sentences of length

For CCM, we also experimented with the original parts of speech, universal tags (CCM-U), the cross-product of the original parts of speech with the Brown clusters (CCM-OB), and the cross-product of the universal tags with the Brown clusters (CCM-UB). The results in Table

          The EM algorithm with the CCM requires very careful initialization, which is described in
