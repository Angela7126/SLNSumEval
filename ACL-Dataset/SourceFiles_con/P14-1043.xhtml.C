       Abstract
      </h6>
      <p class="ltx_p">
       This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework for semi-supervised dependency parsing at entire tree level, referred to as
       ambiguity-aware ensemble training
       .
Instead of only using 1-best parse trees in previous work, our core idea is to utilize parse forest (
       ambiguous labelings
       ) to combine multiple 1-best parse trees generated from diverse parsers on unlabeled data.
With a conditional random field based probabilistic dependency parser, our training objective is to maximize mixed likelihood of labeled data and auto-parsed unlabeled data with ambiguous labelings.
This framework offers two promising advantages.
1) ambiguity encoded in parse forests compromises noise in 1-best parse trees.
During training, the parser is aware of these ambiguous structures, and has the flexibility to distribute probability mass to its preferred parse trees as long as the likelihood improves.
2) diverse syntactic structures produced by different parsers can be naturally compiled into forest,
offering complementary strength to our single-view parser.
Experimental results on benchmark data show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline supervised parser and other entire-tree based semi-supervised methods, such as self-training, co-training and tri-training.

       Introduction
      </h2>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Supervised dependency parsing has made great progress during the past decade.
However, it is very difficult to further improve performance of supervised parsers. For example,
        and
        show that incorporating higher-order features into a graph-based parser only leads to modest increase in parsing accuracy.
In contrast, semi-supervised approaches, which can make use of large-scale unlabeled data, have attracted more and more interest.
Previously, unlabeled data is explored to derive useful local-context features such as word clusters
        []
        , subtree frequencies
        []
        , and
word co-occurrence counts
        []
        .
A few effective learning methods are also proposed for dependency parsing to implicitly utilize distributions on unlabeled data
        []
        .
All above work leads to significant improvement on parsing accuracy.

      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        Another line of research is to pick up some high-quality auto-parsed training instances from unlabeled data using bootstrapping methods, such as self-training
        []
        , co-training
        []
        , and tri-training
        []
        . However, these methods gain limited success in dependency parsing.
Although working well on constituent parsing
        []
        ,
self-training is shown unsuccessful for dependency parsing
        []
        . The reason may be that dependency parsing models are prone to amplify previous mistakes during training on self-parsed unlabeled data.
        apply a variant of co-training to dependency parsing and report positive results on out-of-domain text.
        combine tri-training and parser ensemble to boost parsing accuracy. Both work employs two parsers to process the unlabeled data, and only select as extra training data sentences on which the 1-best parse trees of the two parsers are identical.
In this way, the auto-parsed unlabeled data becomes more reliable.
However, one obvious drawback of these methods is that they are unable to
exploit unlabeled data with divergent outputs from different parsers.
Our experiments show that unlabeled data with identical outputs from different parsers tends to be short (18.25 words per sentence on average), and only has a small proportion of 40% (see Table
        6
        ).
More importantly, we believe that unlabeled data with divergent outputs is equally (if not more) useful.
Intuitively, an unlabeled sentence with divergent outputs should contain some ambiguous syntactic structures (such as preposition phrase attachment) that are very hard to resolve and lead to the disagreement of different parsers.
Such sentences can provide more discriminative instances for training
which may be unavailable in labeled data.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
       <p class="ltx_p">
        To solve above issues,
this paper proposes a more general and effective framework for semi-supervised dependency parsing, referred to as
        ambiguity-aware ensemble training
        .
Different from traditional self/co/tri-training which only use 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data,
our approach adopts ambiguous labelings, represented by parse forest, as gold-standard for unlabeled sentences.
Figure
        1
        shows an example sentence with an ambiguous parse forest.
The forest is formed by two parse trees, respectively shown at the upper and lower sides of the sentence.
The differences between the two parse trees are highlighted using dashed arcs.
The upper tree take
        ‚Äúdeer‚Äù
        as the subject of
        ‚Äúriding‚Äù
        ,
whereas the lower one indicates that
        ‚Äúhe‚Äù
        rides the bicycle.
The other difference is where the preposition phrase (PP)
        ‚Äúin the park‚Äù
        should be attached, which is also known as the PP attachment problem, a notorious challenge for parsing.
Reserving such uncertainty has three potential advantages.
First, noise in unlabeled data is largely alleviated, since parse forest encodes only a few highly possible parse trees with high oracle score.
Please note that the parse forest in Figure
        1
        contains four parse trees after combination of the two different choices.
Second, the parser is able to learn useful features from the unambiguous parts of the parse forest.
Finally, with sufficient unlabeled data, it is possible that the parser can learn to resolve such uncertainty
by biasing to more reasonable parse trees.

       <p class="ltx_p">
        To construct parse forest on unlabeled data,
we employ three supervised parsers based on different paradigms, including
our baseline graph-based dependency parser, a transition-based dependency parser
        []
        , and a generative constituent parser
        []
        .
The 1-best parse trees of these three parsers are aggregated in different ways.
Evaluation on labeled data shows the oracle accuracy of parse forest is much higher than that of 1-best outputs of single parsers (see Table
        3
        ).
Finally, using a conditional random field (CRF) based probabilistic parser,
we train a better model by
maximizing mixed likelihood of labeled data and auto-parsed unlabeled data with ambiguous labelings.
Experimental results on both English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed ambiguity-aware ensemble training outperforms other entire-tree based methods such as self/co/tri-training.
In summary, we make following contributions.

        In standard entire-tree based semi-supervised methods such as self/co/tri-training,
automatically parsed unlabeled sentences are used as additional training data, and
noisy 1-best parse trees are considered as gold-standard.
To alleviate the noise, the tri-training method only uses unlabeled data on which multiple parsers from different views produce identical parse trees.
However, unlabeled data with divergent syntactic structures should be more useful.
Intuitively, if several parsers disagree on an unlabeled sentence,
it implies that the unlabeled sentence contains some difficult syntactic phenomena which are not sufficiently covered in manually labeled data.
Therefore, exploiting such unlabeled data may introduce more discriminative syntactic knowledge,
largely compensating labeled training data.

When using the outputs of GParser itself (‚ÄúUnlabeled

The results on both English and Chinese re-confirm that

consistent with previous studies

another parser‚Äôs 1-best results are projected into unlabeled data to help the core parser.
Using unlabeled data with the results of ZPar (‚ÄúUnlabeled

We believe the reason is that being a generative model designed for constituent parsing,
Berkeley Parser is more different from discriminative dependency parsers, and therefore can
provide more divergent syntactic structures.
This kind of syntactic divergence is helpful because it can provide complementary knowledge from a different perspective.
         also show that the diversity of parsers is important for performance improvement when integrating different parsers in the supervised track.
Therefore, we can conclude that
         co-training helps dependency parsing, especially when using a more divergent parser

Although using less unlabeled sentences (0.7M for English and 1.2M for Chinese),

         Contribution of unlabeled data with regard to syntactic divergence:
         We divide the unlabeled data into three sets according to the divergence of the 1-best outputs of Berkeley Parser and ZPar.
The first set contains those sentences that the two parsers produce identical parse trees, denoted by ‚Äúconsistent‚Äù, which corresponds to the setting for tri-training.
Other sentences are split into two sets according to averaged number of heads per word in parse forests, denoted by ‚Äúlow divergence‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh divergence‚Äù respectively.
Then we train semi-supervised GParser using the three sets of unlabeled data.
Table
         6
         illustrates the results and statistics.
We can see that unlabeled data with identical outputs from Berkeley Parser and ZPar tends to be short sentences (18.25 words per sentence on average).
Results show all the three sets of unlabeled data can help the parser.
Especially, the unlabeled data with highly divergent structures leads to slightly higher improvement.
This demonstrates that
         our approach can better exploit unlabeled data on which parsers of different views produce divergent structures

         Impact of unlabeled data size:
         To understand how our approach performs with regards to the unlabeled data size,
we train semi-supervised GParser with different sizes of unlabeled data.
Fig.
         3
         shows the accuracy curve on the test set.
We can see that the parser consistently achieves higher accuracy with more unlabeled data,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We expect that our approach has potential to achieve higher accuracy with more additional data.

        Our work is originally inspired by the work of
        .
They first apply the idea of ambiguous labelings to multilingual parser transfer in the unsupervised parsing field, which
aims to build a dependency parser for a resource-poor target language by making use of source-language treebanks.
Different from their work, we explore the idea for semi-supervised dependency parsing where a certain amount of labeled training data is available.
Moreover, we for the first time build a state-of-the-art CRF-based dependency parser and conduct in-depth comparisons with previous methods.
Similar ideas of learning with ambiguous labelings are previously explored for classification
        []
        and sequence labeling problems
        []
        .

        Our work is also related with the parser ensemble approaches such as stacked learning and re-parsing in the supervised track.
Stacked learning uses one parser‚Äôs outputs as guide features for another parser, leading to improved performance
        []
        .
Re-parsing merges the outputs of several parsers into a dependency graph, and then apply Viterbi decoding to find a better tree
        []
        .
One possible drawback of parser ensemble is that several parsers are required to parse the same sentence during the test phase.
Moreover, our approach can benefit from these methods in that we can get parse forests of higher quality on unlabeled data
