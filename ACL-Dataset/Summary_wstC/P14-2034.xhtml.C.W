   Results of Phase 1 provide support for the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis, at least as a strong bias.

   More work will be needed to determine the strength of that bias.

   The findings are largely consistent with VerbNet s semantics, but changes are indicated in some cases.

   We find that inter-annotator agreement is sufficiently high that annotation can be done effectively using the modal response with an average of 6-7 responses per item.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We are currently investigating whether we can achieve better reliability with fewer responses per item by taking into account an individual annotator s history across items, as recent work suggests is possible [ 13 , 17 , 19 ].

   Thus, crowd-sourcing VerbNet semantic entailments appears to be both feasible and productive.

   Data-collection continues.

   Phase 2, which added over 10 new verb classes, is complete.

  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Phase 3, which includes both new classes and new entailments, has been launched.
