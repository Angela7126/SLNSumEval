   We presented a proposal for a new learning and evaluation framework for SMT.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The central idea is to ground meaning transfer in successful interaction in an extrinsic task, and use task-based feedback for structured learning.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We presented a proof-of-concept experiment that defines the extrinsic task as executing semantic parses of translated queries against the Geoquery database.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Our experiments show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for response-based learning over structured learning from reference translations.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Our error analysis shows that response-based learning generates grammatical translations which is due to the additional use of a cost function that boosts similarity of translations to human reference translations.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   In future work, we would like to extend our work on embedding SMT in virtual gameplay to larger and more diverse datasets, and involve human feedback in the response-based learning loop.
