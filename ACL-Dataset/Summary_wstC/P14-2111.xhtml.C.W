   Denoising autoencoders provide an intuitive solution for domain adaptation transform the features into a representation that is resistant to the noise that may characterize the domain adaptation process.

   The original implementation of this idea produced this noise directly [ 12 ] ; later work showed that dropout noise could be analytically marginalized [ 4 ].

   We take another step towards simplicity by showing that structured dropout can make marginalization even easier, obtaining dramatic speedups without sacrificing accuracy.
