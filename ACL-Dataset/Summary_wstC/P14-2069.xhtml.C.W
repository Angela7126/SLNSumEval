   We use crowdsourcing to collect POS annotations with minimal context (five-word windows.

   While the performance of POS models learned from this data is still slightly below that of models trained on expert annotations, models learned from aggregations approach oracle performance for POS tagging.

   In general, we find that the use of a dictionary tends to make aggregations more useful, irrespective of aggregation method.

   For some downstream tasks, models using the aggregated POS tags perform even better than models using expert-annotated tags.
