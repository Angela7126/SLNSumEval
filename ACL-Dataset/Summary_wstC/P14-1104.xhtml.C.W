   Leveraging the burstiness of content words, we have developed a simple technique to consistently boost term detection performance across languages.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Using word repetitions, we effectively use a broad document context outside of the typical 2-5 N-gram window.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Furthermore, we see improvements across a broad spectrum of languages languages with syllable-based word tokens (Vietnamese, Cantonese), complex morphology (Turkish), and dialect variability (Pashto.

  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Secondly, our results are not only effective but also intuitive, given that the interpolation weight parameter matches our expectations for the burstiness of the word tokens in the language on which it is estimated.

  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We have focused primarily on re-scoring results for the term detection task.

   Given the effectiveness of the technique across multiple languages, we hope to extend our effort to exploit our human tendency towards redundancy to decoding or other aspects of the spoken document processing pipeline.
