   We have presented CoSimRank , a new similarity measure that can be computed for a single node pair without relying on the similarities in the whole graph.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   We gave two different formalizations of CoSimRank i) a derivation from Personalized PageRank and (ii) a matrix representation that can take advantage of fast matrix multiplication algorithms.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We also presented extensions of CoSimRank for a number of applications, thus demonstrating the flexibility of CoSimRank as a similarity measure.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We showed that CoSimRank is superior to SimRank in time and space complexity; and we demonstrated that CoSimRank performs better than PPR+cos on two similarity computation tasks.
