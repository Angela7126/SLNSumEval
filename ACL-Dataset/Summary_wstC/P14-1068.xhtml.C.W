   We experimented strategies to predict both MWE analysis and dependency structure, and tested them on the dependency version of French Treebank [ 1 ] , as instantiated in the SPMRL Shared Task [ 23 ].

   Our work focused on using an alternative representation of syntactically regular MWEs, which captures their syntactic internal structure.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We obtain a system with comparable performance to that of previous works on this dataset, but which predicts both syntactic dependencies and the internal structure of MWEs.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   This can be useful for capturing the various degrees of semantic compositionality of MWEs.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The main weakness of our system comes from the identification of regular MWEs, a property which is highly lexical.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Our current use of external lexicons does not seem to suffice, and the use of data-driven external information to better cope with this identification can be envisaged.
