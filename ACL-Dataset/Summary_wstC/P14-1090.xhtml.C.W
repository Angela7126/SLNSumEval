   In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for learning sentence-level sentiment.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   Our approach incorporates intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints while training a conditional random field model via posterior regularization.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We explore a rich set of context-aware constraints at both intra- and inter-sentential levels, and demonstrate their effectiveness in the analysis of sentence-level sentiment.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   While we focus on the sentence-level task, our approach can be easily extended to handle sentiment analysis at finer levels of granularity.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Our experiments show that our model achieves better accuracy than existing supervised and semi-supervised models for the sentence-level sentiment classification task.
