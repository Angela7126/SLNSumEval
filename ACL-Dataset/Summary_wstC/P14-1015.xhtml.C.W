   Two video games have been presented for validating and extending knowledge bases.
  </a>
  <a href="#1" id="1">
   The first game, Infection, validates concept-concept relations, and the second, The Knowledge Towers, validates image-concept relations.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   In experiments involving online players, we demonstrate three contributions.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   First, games were released in two conditions whereby players either saw financial incentives for playing or a personal satisfaction incentive where they were thanked by us.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   We demonstrated that both conditions produced nearly identical numbers of annotations and, moreover, that players were disinterested in the satisfaction incentive, suggesting they played out of interest in the game itself.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel design for games with a purpose which does not require two players for validation and instead reinforces behavior only using true negative items that required no manual annotation.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Second, in a comparison with crowdsourcing, we demonstrate that video game-based annotations consistently generated higher-quality annotations.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Last, we demonstrate that video game-based annotation can be more cost-effective than crowdsourcing or annotation tasks with game-like features.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   The significant number of annotations generated by the satisfaction incentive condition shows that a fun game can generate high-quality annotations at virtually no cost.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   All annotated resources, demos of the games, and a live version of the top-ranking items for each concept are currently available online.

   In the future we will apply our video games to the validation of more data, such as the new Wikipedia bitaxonomy [ 11 ].
