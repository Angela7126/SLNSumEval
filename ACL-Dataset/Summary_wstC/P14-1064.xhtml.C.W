   Negation plays a fundamental role in modifying sentiment.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   In the process of semantic composition, the impact of negators is complicated by the syntax and semantics of the text spans they modify.

   This paper provides a comprehensive and quantitative study of the behavior of negators through a unified view of fitting human annotation.

  <a href="#3" id="3">
   We first measure the modeling capabilities of two influential heuristics on a sentiment treebank and find that they capture some effect of negation; however, extending these non-lexicalized models to be dependent on the negators improves the performance statistically significantly.

  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The detailed analysis reveals the differences in the behavior among negators, and we argue that they should always be modeled separately.
  </a>

   We further make the models to be dependent on the text being modified by negators, through adaptation of a state-of-the-art recursive neural network to incorporate the syntax and semantics of the arguments; we discover this further reduces fitting errors.
