   We have provided experimental evidence against the hypothesis that the phonology of L1 strongly affects the choice of words in L2.

   We showed that a small set of high-frequency function words have disproportionate influence on the accuracy of a bigram-based NLI classifier, and that the majority of the indicative bigrams appear to be independent of L1.

   This suggests an alternative explanation of the effectiveness of a bigram-based classifier in identifying the native language of a writer that the character bigrams simply mirror differences in the word usage rather than the phonology of L1.

   Our explanation concurs with the findings of Daland ( 2013 ) that unigram frequency differences in certain types of phonological segments between child-directed and adult-directed speech are due to a small number of word types, such as you , what , and want , rather than to any general phonological preferences.

   He argues that the relative frequency of sounds in speech is driven by the relative frequency of words.

   In a similar vein, Koppel et al.

   2005 ) see the usefulness of character n -grams as simply an artifact of variable usage of particular words, which in turn might be the result of different thematic preferences, or as a reflection of the L1 orthography.

   We conclude by noting that our experimental results do not imply that the phonology of L1 has absolutely no influence on L2 writing.

   Rather, they show that the evidence from the Native Language Identification task has so far been inconclusive in this regard.
