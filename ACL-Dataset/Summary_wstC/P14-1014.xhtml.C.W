   We have presented approximate inference strategies to jointly compress sentences under bigram and dependency-factored objectives by exploiting the modularity of the task and considering the two subproblems in isolation.

   Experiments show that one of these approximation strategies produces results comparable to a state-of-the-art integer linear program for the same joint inference task with a 60% reduction in average inference time.
