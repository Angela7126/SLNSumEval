   GPUs represent a challenging opportunity for natural language processing.

  <a href="#1" id="1">
   By carefully designing within the constraints imposed by the architecture, we have created a parser that can exploit the same kinds of sparsity that have been developed for more traditional architectures.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   One of the key remaining challenges going forward is confronting the kind of lexicalized sparsity common in other NLP models.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The Berkeley parser s grammars by virtue of being unlexicalized can be applied uniformly to all parse items.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The bilexical features needed by dependency models and lexicalized constituency models are not directly amenable to acceleration using the techniques we described here.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Determining how to efficiently implement these kinds of models is a promising area for new research.
