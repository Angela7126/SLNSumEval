   None of these discourse factors has a significant impact on translation quality from Arabic to English.

   Translation quality from both languages is adversely affected by translations of discourse relations expressed implicitly in one language but explicitly in the other or by paired connectives.

   Our experiments indicate that discourse usage may affect machine translation between some language pairs but not others, and for particular relations such as contingency.

   Finally, we established the need to identify sentences in the source language that would be translated into multiple sentences in English.
