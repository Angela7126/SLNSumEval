<a href="#0" id="0">To learn Con , we propose a data-driven markedness constraint learning system that avoids both innateness and tractability issues.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Unlike previous OT learning methods, which assume known constraint definitions and only learn the relative strength of these constraints, the IBPOT learns constraint violation profiles and weights for them simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The constraints are derived from sets of violations that effectively explain the observed data, rather than being selected from a pre-existing set of possible constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The Wolof data has 36 input forms, each of the form V 1 ⁢ t ⁢ V 2 , where V 1 and V 2 are vowels that agree in height.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Each input form has four candidate outputs, with one output always winning.</a>
