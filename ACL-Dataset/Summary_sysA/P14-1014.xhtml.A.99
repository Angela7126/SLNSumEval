<a href="#0" id="0">This may partly be due to the fact that unlike computer vision tasks, the input structure of POS tagging or other sequential labelling tasks is relatively simple, and a single non-linear layer is enough to model the interactions within the input [ 27 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This is consistent with previous work (Le Roux et al., 2011), which found that for noisy data such as web domain text, data cleaning is a effective and necessary step.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally, using word representation , which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM, or ngram-level representation , which corresponds to initializing both the projection and sigmoid layers of the web-feature module by the learned WRRBM.</a>
