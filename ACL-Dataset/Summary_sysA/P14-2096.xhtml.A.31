<a href="#1" id="1">We propose a method based on article hypernym and topic model to link English Wikipedia articles to corresponding Chinese Baidu Baike articles.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our method comprises two stages candidate selection and candidate ranking.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We formulate candidate selection as a cross-language information retrieval task based on the title similarity between English and Chinese articles.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In candidate ranking, we employ several features of the articles in our SVM model.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To evaluate our method, we compile a dataset from English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike, containing the 500 most popular Baidu articles.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Evaluation results of our method show an MRR of up to 80.95% and a recall of 87.46%.</a>
