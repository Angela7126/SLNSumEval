<a href="#0" id="0">We present a new dataset of Twitter messages that use FactBank predicates (e.g.,, claim , say , insist ) to scope the claims of named entity sources.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This dataset was annotated by Mechanical Turk workers who gave ratings for the factuality of the scoped claims in each Twitter message.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Saur√≠ ( 2008 ) describes several classes of source-introducing predicates, which indicate how the source relates to the quoted claim.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We are unaware of prior work comparing the contribution of linguistic and extra-linguistic predictors (e.g.,, source and journalist features) for factuality ratings.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This prior work also does not measure the impact of individual cues and cue classes on assessment of factuality.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Perceptions of the factuality of quoted content are influenced by the cue words used to introduce them, while extra-linguistic factors, such as the source and the author, did not appear to be relevant in our experiments.</a>
