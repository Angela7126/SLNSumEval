<a href="#0" id="0">With this simple reranking strategy and each of three different Treebank parsers, we find that it is possible to improve BLEU scores on Penn Treebank development data with White Rajkumar ’ s [ 28 , 36 ] baseline generative model, but not with their averaged perceptron model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In inspecting the results of reranking with this strategy, we observe that while it does sometimes succeed in avoiding egregious errors involving vicious ambiguities, common parsing mistakes such as PP-attachment errors lead to unnecessarily sacrificing conciseness or fluency in order to avoid ambiguities that would be easily tolerated by human readers.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To improve word ordering decisions, White Rajkumar [ 36 ] demonstrated that incorporating a feature into the ranker inspired by Gibson ’ s [ 12 ] dependency locality theory can deliver statistically significant improvements in automatic evaluation scores, better match the distributional characteristics of sentence orderings, and significantly reduce the number of serious ordering errors (some involving vicious ambiguities) as confirmed by a targeted human evaluation.</a>
