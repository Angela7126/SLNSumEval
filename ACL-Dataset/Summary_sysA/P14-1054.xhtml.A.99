<a href="#0" id="0">Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Unlike the traditional segmentation based method, which is a partition of the sentence, the Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The soft constraint is the method to generate the combine features 1 1 If without ambiguity, we also use the terminology of “ soft constraint ” denoting features generated by the employed constraint conditions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the following experiments, focusing on Chinese relation extraction, we will analyze the performance of candidate feature sets and study the influence of the constraint conditions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By-Segmentation denotes the traditional segmentation based feature set generated by a segmentation tool, collecting every output of relation mention.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The soft constraint utilizes four constraint conditions to catch the structure information in a relation instance.</a>
