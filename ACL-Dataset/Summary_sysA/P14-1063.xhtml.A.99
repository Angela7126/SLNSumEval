<a href="#0" id="0">By contrast, a linear tensor model only needs to learn H ⁢∑ d = 1 D n d “ bases ” of the m feature weights instead of individual weights directly.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The size n d of each tensor mode, d = 1 , … , D , determines the structure of feature weights a tensor model can precisely represent, as well as the number of parameters to estimate (we also assume H = 1 in the analysis below.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However it is hard to know the structure of target feature weights before learning, and it would be impractical to try every possible combination of mode sizes, therefore we choose the criterion of determining the mode sizes as minimization of the total number of parameters, namely we solve the problem.</a>
