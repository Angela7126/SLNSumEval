<a href="#1" id="1">We evaluated the proposed RNN-based alignment models against two baselines the IBM Model 4 and the FFNN-based model with one hidden layer.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In N ⁢ T ⁢ C ⁢ I ⁢ R and F ⁢ B ⁢ I ⁢ S , each alignment model was trained from the randomly sampled 100 K data, and then a translation model was trained from all the training data that was word-aligned by the alignment model.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 4 demonstrates that the proposed RNN-based model outperforms I ⁢ B ⁢ M ⁢ 4 trained from the unlabeled 40 K data by employing either the 1 K labeled data or the 9 K unlabeled data, which is less than 25% of the training data for I ⁢ B ⁢ M ⁢ 4.</a>
