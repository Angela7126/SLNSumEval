<a href="#1" id="1">1) For each regex match, we score whether it matches based on the span as well.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, “ make ” is a match for VP-t in Figures 3 and 3 , and is also a match for the span as well, since in both derivation trees it includes the words “ make … Florida ”.</a>
