<a href="#0" id="0">Most work in user classification relies on featurizing language use, most simply through binary indicators recording whether a user did or did not use a particular word in a history of n tweets.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To explore whether language provides signal for future work in fine-grain social role prediction, we constructed a set of experiments, one per role, where training and test sets were balanced between users from a random background sample and self-reported users.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">From the remaining attribute terms, we identified users with tweets scoring 4.0 or better as positive examples of the associated roles.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Tweets from those users were scraped via the Twitter API to construct corpora for each role.</a>
