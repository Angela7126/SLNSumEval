<a href="#0" id="0">In theory, semantic information could offer a valuable cue for phoneme induction 1 1 The models in this paper do not distinguish between phonetic and phonemic categories, since they do not capture phonological processes (and there are also none present in our synthetic data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We thus use the terms interchangeably by helping infants distinguish between minimal pairs, as linguists do ( 48.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In the individual components of VM, TLD and LD have similar VC ( “ recall ” ), but TLD has higher VH ( “ precision ” ), demonstrating that the semantic information given by the topics can separate potentially ambiguous words, as hypothesized.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Overall, the contextual semantic information added in the TLD model leads to both better phonetic categorization and to a better protolexicon, especially when the input is noisier, using degraded consonants.</a>
