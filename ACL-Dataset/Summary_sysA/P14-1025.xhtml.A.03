<a href="#0" id="0">We further propose a method for applying our sense distribution acquisition system to the task of finding unattested senses â€” i.e.,, senses that are in the sense inventory but not attested in a given corpus.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Corpus instances of a word can also correspond to senses that are not present in a given sense inventory.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The predominant sense and distribution across senses for each target lemma was obtained by aggregating over the sense annotations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that we do not consider high-frequency senses with frequency higher than 0.6, as it is rare for a medium- to high-frequency word to take on a novel sense which is then the predominant sense in a given corpus.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A usage that corresponds to a novel sense should have a topic that does not align well with any of the pre-existing senses in the sense inventory.</a>
