<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, instead of proposing a new metric, we focus on enriching current MT evaluation metrics with discourse information.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To do so, we contrast different MT evaluation metrics with and without discourse information.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this section, we explore how discourse information can be used to improve machine translation evaluation metrics.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Below we present the evaluation results at the system- and segment-level, using our two basic metrics on discourse trees (Section 3.1 ), which are referred to as DRÂ and DR- lex.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our results show that discourse-based metrics can improve the state-of-the-art MT metrics, by increasing correlation with human judgments, even when only sentence-level discourse information is used.</a>
