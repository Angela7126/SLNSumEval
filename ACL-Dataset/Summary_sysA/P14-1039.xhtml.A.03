<a href="#0" id="0">With the SVM reranker, we obtain a significant improvement in BLEU scores over White Rajkumar ’ s averaged perceptron model on both development and test data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Simple ranking with the Berkeley parser of the generative model ’ s n -best realizations raised the BLEU score from 85.55 to 86.07, well below the averaged perceptron model ’ s BLEU score of 87.93.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Similarly, we conjectured that large differences in the realizer ’ s perceptron model score may more reliably reflect human fluency preferences than small ones, and thus we combined this score with features for parser accuracy in an SVM ranker.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper, we have shown that while using parse accuracy in a simple reranking strategy for self-monitoring fails to improve BLEU scores over a state-of-the-art averaged perceptron realization ranking model, it is possible to significantly increase BLEU scores using an SVM ranker that combines the realizer ’ s model score together with features from multiple parsers, including ones designed to make the ranker more robust to parsing mistakes that human readers would be unlikely to make.</a>
