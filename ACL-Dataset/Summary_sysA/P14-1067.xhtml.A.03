<a href="#0" id="0">Our results show that the sensitivity of online QE models to different distributions of training and test instances makes them more suitable than batch methods for integration in a CAT framework.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The batch model is built by learning only from the training data and is evaluated on the test set without exploiting information from the test instances.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">On each combination of training and test sets, the batch , adaptive , and empty models are trained and evaluated in terms of global MAE scores on the test set.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is a strong evidence of the fact that, in case of domain changes, online models can still learn from new test instances even if they have a label distribution similar to the training set.</a>
