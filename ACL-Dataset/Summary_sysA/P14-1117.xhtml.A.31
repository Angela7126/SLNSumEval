<a href="#0" id="0">The Chu-Liu Edmonds algorithm is also employed for another purpose when the underlying LP for the joint inference problem is not tight — a frequent occurrence in our compression experiments — Algorithm 2.2 will not converge on a single primal solution and will instead oscillate between solutions that are close to the dual optimum.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We identify this phenomenon by counting repeated solutions and, if they exceed some threshold l max with at least one repeated solution from either subproblem, we terminate the update procedure for Lagrange multipliers and instead attempt to identify a good solution from the repeating ones by scoring them under ( 2.</a>
