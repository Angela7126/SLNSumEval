<a href="#0" id="0">2) We propose a novel ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed word graph by taking the query content, overall information content and grammaticality (i.e.,, fluency) of the sentence into consideration.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In order to generate an abstract summary, we need to identify which sentences from the previous step (i.e.,, redundancy removal) can be clustered and combined in generated abstract sentences.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The purpose of such a model is three-fold i) to cover the content of query information optimally; ii) to generate a more readable and grammatical sentence; and iii) to favor strong connections between the concepts.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Considering the fact that the abstract sentences are automatically generated and the original sentences are human-written, the grammaticality score and the percentage of fully grammatical sentences generated by our system, with higher ROUGE or quality scores in comparison with other methods, demonstrates that our system is an effective phrasal query abstraction framework for both spoken and written conversations.</a>
