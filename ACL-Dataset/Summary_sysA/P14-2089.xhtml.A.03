<a href="#0" id="0">We propose a new training objective for learning word embeddings that incorporates prior knowledge.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Word2vec [] is an algorithm for learning embeddings using a neural language model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Based on our initial experiments, RCM uses the output embeddings of cbow.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, we use the embeddings from a trained joint model to pre-train an RCM model.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After obtaining trained embeddings from any of our objectives, we use the embeddings in the word2vec model to measure perplexity of the test set.</a>
