<a href="#0" id="0">We wish to predict sentiment annotation complexity of the text using a supervised technique.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As stated above, the time-to-annotate is one good candidate.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, “ simple time measurement ” is not reliable because the annotator may spend time not doing any annotation due to fatigue or distraction.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We presented a metric called Sentiment Annotation Complexity (SAC), a metric in SA research that has been unexplored until now.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">First, the process of data preparation through eye tracking, labeled with the SAC score was elaborated.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Using this data set and a set of linguistic features, we trained a regression model to predict SAC.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Our predictive framework for SAC resulted in a mean percentage error of 22.02%, and a moderate correlation of 0.57 between the predicted and observed SAC values.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Finally, we observe a negative correlation between the classifier confidence scores and a SAC, as expected.</a>
