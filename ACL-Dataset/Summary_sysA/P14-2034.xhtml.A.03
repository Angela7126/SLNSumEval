<a href="#0" id="0">We compare our work to the original Green and DeNero model and two other Arabic segmentation systems the MADA+TOKAN toolkit v. 3.1 [ 6 ] and its Egyptian dialect variant, MADA-ARZ v. 0.4 [ 7 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In particular, a few colloquial ‘‘ filler ’’ expressions are sometimes not segmented, despite being compound Arabic words that are segmented elsewhere in the data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We evaluated our segmenter on broadcast news and Egyptian Arabic due to the current availability of annotated data in these domains.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, as data for other Arabic dialects and genres becomes available, we expect that the model ’ s simplicity and the domain adaptation method we use will allow the system to be applied to these dialects with minimal effort and without a loss of performance in the original domains.</a>
