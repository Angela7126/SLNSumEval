<a href="#1" id="1">BabySRL is a computational model of semantic role acquistion using a similar set of assumptions to the current work.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">BabySRL learns weights over ordering constraints (e.g., preverbal, second noun, etc.) to acquire semantic role labelling while still exhibiting 1-1 role bias.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The acquisition of semantic role labelling (SRL) by the BabySRL model [] bears many similarities to the current work and is, to our knowledge, the only comparable line of inquiry to the current one.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The primary function of BabySRL is to model the acquisition of semantic role labelling while making an idiosyncratic error which infants also make [] , the 1-1 role bias error ( John and Mary gorped interpreted as John gorped Mary.</a>
