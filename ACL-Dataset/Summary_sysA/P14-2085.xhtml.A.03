<a href="#0" id="0">While most verbs have one predominant interpretation, others are more flexible for aspectual class and can occur as either stative ( 1 ) or dynamic ( 1 ) depending on the context.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context ( stative , dynamic , both ), we assume a supervised learning setting and explore features mined from a large background corpus, distributional features, and instance-based features.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Our experiments show that in any setting where labeled training data is available, improvement over the most frequent class baseline can only be reached by integrating instance-based features, though type-based features (LingInd, Dist) may provide useful priors for some verbs and successfully predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types.</a>
