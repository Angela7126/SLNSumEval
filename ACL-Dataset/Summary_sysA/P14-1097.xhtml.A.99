<a href="#0" id="0">First, we make multiple data points for each verb to deal with verb polysemy (cf polysemy-aware previous studies still represented a verb as one data point [ 14 , 23 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To do that, we induce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering verb uses.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, we induce verb classes by clustering these verb-specific semantic frames across verbs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To induce verb classes across verbs, we apply clustering to the induced verb-specific semantic frames.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We can use exactly the same clustering method as described in Section 3.2.3 by using semantic frames for multiple verbs as an input instead of initial frames for a single verb.</a>
