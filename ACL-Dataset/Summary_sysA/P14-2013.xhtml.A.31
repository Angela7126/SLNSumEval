<a href="#0" id="0">In our approach we model each possible candidate for every NE mention in a document as a distinct node in a graph and model candidate coherence by links between the nodes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this section we discuss the construction of a graph representation that we call the solution graph.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The input is a document containing pre-tagged NE textual mentions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The solution graph is an undirected graph G = ( V , D ) where V is the node set of all possible NE candidates for different textual mentions in the input document and D is the set of edges between nodes.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Edges are not drawn between different nodes for the same mention.</a>
