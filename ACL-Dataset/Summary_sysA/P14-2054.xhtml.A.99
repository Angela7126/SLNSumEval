<a href="#0" id="0">Our method extends Eisner ’ s cubic time parsing algorithm by adding signatures to each span, which indicate the number of deleted words and the rightmost kept word within the span, resulting in O ⁢ ( n 6 ) time complexity and O ⁢ ( n 4 ) space complexity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For each combination, the algorithm enumerates the number of virtual arcs in the left and right spans, and the split position (e.g.,, k ′ , k ′′ , r in case 2), thus it takes O ⁢ ( n 3 ) running time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We drop the signature of the virtual arc number from each span, and thus obtain an O ⁢ ( n 4 ) time algorithm.</a>
