<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we instead try to minimize the structural complexity of the grammar by moving as much context as possible onto local surface features.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our parser uses a minimal PCFG backbone grammar to ensure a basic level of structural well-formedness, but relies mostly on features of surface spans to drive accuracy.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One advantage of a system that relies on surface features and a simple grammar is that it is portable not only across languages but also across tasks to an extent.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Subsequent lines in Table 1 indicate additional surface feature templates computed over the span, which are then conjoined with the rule identity as shown in Figure 1 to give additional features.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Adding these simple features (first word, last word, and lengths) as span features of the X-bar grammar already gives us a substantial improvement over our baseline system, improving the parser â€™ s performance from 73.0 F1 to 85.0 F1 (see Table 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Recall from Section 3 that every span feature is conjoined with indicators over rules and rule parents to produce features over anchored rule productions; when we consider adding an annotation layer to the grammar, what that does is refine the rule indicators that are conjoined with every span feature.</a>
