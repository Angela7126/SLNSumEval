<a href="#0" id="0">Crucially, the GP expression with the bilingual knowledge is then used as side information to regularize a CRFs (conditional random fields) model ’ s learning over treebank and bitext data, based on the posterior regularization (PR) framework [ 9 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">But, unlike the prior pipelined approaches, this study performs a joint learning behavior in which GP is used as a learning constraint to interact with the CRFs model estimation.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">One of our main objectives is to bias CRFs model ’ s learning on unlabeled data, under a non-linear GP constraint encoding the bilingual knowledge.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In what follows, the graph setting and propagation expression are introduced.</a>
