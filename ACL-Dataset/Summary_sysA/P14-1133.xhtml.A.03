<a href="#0" id="0">Given an utterance x and the KB, we construct a set of candidate logical forms 𝒵 x , and then for each z ∈𝒵 x generate a small set of canonical natural language utterances 𝒞 z.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We define a discriminative log-linear model that places a probability distribution over pairs of logical forms and canonical utterances ( c , z ) , given an utterance x.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that the candidate set of logical forms 𝒵 x and canonical utterances 𝒞 x are constructed during the canonical utterance construction phase.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given an input utterance x , we first construct a set of logical forms 𝒵 x , and then generate canonical utterances from each z ∈𝒵 x.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Once the candidate set of logical forms paired with canonical utterances is constructed, our problem is reduced to scoring pairs ( c , z ) based on a paraphrase model.</a>
