<a href="#1" id="1">In contrast, we use pairwise morphological similarity as a prior in a non-parametric clustering model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can create an infinite mixture model by combining the ddCRP prior with a likelihood function defining the probability of the data given the cluster assignments.</a>
