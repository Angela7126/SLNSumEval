<a href="#1" id="1">We expect a dependency parsing model to benefit from several aspects of the low-rank tensor scoring.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our parsing model aims to combine the strengths of both traditional features from the MST/Turbo parser as well as the new low-rank tensor features.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When Γ = 0 , the arc scores are entirely based on the low-rank tensor and Δ⁢Θ = 0.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We should note that since our model parameter A is represented and learned in the low-rank form, we only have to store and maintain the low-rank projections U ⁢Φ h , V ⁢Φ m and W ⁢Φ h , m rather than explicitly calculate the feature tensor Φ h ⊗Φ m ⊗Φ h , m.</a>
