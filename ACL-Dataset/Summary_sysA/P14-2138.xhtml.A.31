<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we provide evidence against the above hypothesis.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We design an algorithm to identify the most discriminative words and the character bigrams that are indicative of such words, and perform two experiments to quantify their impact on the NLI task.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The results of the first experiment demonstrate that the removal of a relatively small set of discriminative words from the training data significantly impairs the accuracy of a bigram-based classifier.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The results of the second experiment reveal that the most indicative bigrams are quite similar across different language sets.</a>
