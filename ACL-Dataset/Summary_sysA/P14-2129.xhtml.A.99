<a href="#0" id="0">Table 1 presents hedge parsing accuracy on the development set for the full parsing baseline, where the output of regular PCFG parsing is transformed to hedges and evaluated, versus parsing with a hedgebank grammar, with no segmentation of the strings.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The results show the same patterns as on the development set.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Finally, Figure 3 shows the speed of inference, labeled precision and labeled recall of annotating hedge constituents on the test set as a function of the maximum span parameter L , versus the baseline parser.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Keep in mind that the number of reference constituents increases as L increases, hence both precision and recall can decrease as the parameter grows.</a>
