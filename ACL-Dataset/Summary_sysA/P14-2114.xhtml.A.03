<a href="#1" id="1">We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It should be noted here that some event elements such as location is not always available in the tweets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this paper we have proposed an unsupervised Bayesian model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract the structured representation of events from social media data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After that, the model can automatically extract events which involving a named entity at certain time, location, and with event-related keywords based on the co-occurrence patterns of the event elements.</a>
