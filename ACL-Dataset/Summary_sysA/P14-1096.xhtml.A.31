<a href="#1" id="1">1 ≤ k ≤ m , 1 ≤ l ≤ n denotes the fraction of words in a newer sense cluster s j ⁢ l , that were also present in an older sense cluster s i ⁢ k.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">K = m + 1 , 1 ≤ l ≤ n denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s j ⁢ l , that were not present in any of the m clusters in t ⁢ v i.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">Table 3 shows the evaluation results for a few candidate words, flagged due to birth.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Columns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term ‘ birth cluster ’ for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes.</a>
