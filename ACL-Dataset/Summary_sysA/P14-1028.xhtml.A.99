<a href="#1" id="1">Workable as previous neural network models seem, a limitation of them to be pointed out is that the tag-tag interaction, tag-character interaction and character-character interaction are not well modeled.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">[ 15 ] modeled Chinese word segmentation as a series of classification task at each position of the sentence in which the tag score is transformed into probability using softmax function.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The model is then trained in MLE-style which maximizes the log-likelihood of the tagged data.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, the transition score in equation (4) is not necessary in our model, because, by incorporating tag embedding into the neural network, the effect of tag-tag interaction and tag-character interaction are covered uniformly in one same model.</a>
