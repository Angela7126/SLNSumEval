<a href="#1" id="1">If a word undergoes sense change, this can be detected by comparing the sense clusters obtained from two different time periods by the algorithm outlined above.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let C i = { s i ⁢ 1 , s i ⁢ 2 , … , s i ⁢ m } and C j = { s j ⁢ 1 , s j ⁢ 2 , … , s j ⁢ n } , where s k ⁢ z denotes z t ⁢ h sense cluster for word w during time interval t ⁢ v k.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We hypothesize that word w can undergo sense change from one time interval ( t ⁢ v i ) to another ( t ⁢ v j ) as per one of the following scenarios.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">K = m + 1 , 1 ≤ l ≤ n denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s j ⁢ l , that were not present in any of the m clusters in t ⁢ v i.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">1 ≤ k ≤ m , l = n + 1 denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s i ⁢ k , that did not show up in any of the n clusters in t ⁢ v j.</a>
