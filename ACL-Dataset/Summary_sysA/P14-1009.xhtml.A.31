<a href="#0" id="0">The plf model performs very well on both anvan benchmarks, outperforming not only add and mult, but also the full-fledged lf model.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given that these data sets contain, systematically, transitive verbs, the major difference between plf and lf lies in their representation of the latter.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Evidently, the separately-trained subject and object matrices of plf, being less affected by data sparseness than the 3-way tensors of lf, are better able to capture how verbs interact with their arguments.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For anvan1, plf is just below the state of the art, which is based on disambiguating the verb vector in context [ 18 ] , and lf outperforms the baseline, which consists in using the verb vector only as a proxy to sentence similarity.</a>
