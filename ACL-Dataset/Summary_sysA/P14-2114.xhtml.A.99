<a href="#1" id="1">The graphical model of LEM is shown in Figure 2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper we have proposed an unsupervised Bayesian model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract the structured representation of events from social media data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Instead of employing labeled corpora for training, the proposed model only requires the identification of named entities, locations and time expressions.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">After that, the model can automatically extract events which involving a named entity at certain time, location, and with event-related keywords based on the co-occurrence patterns of the event elements.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our proposed model has been evaluated on the FSD corpus.</a>
