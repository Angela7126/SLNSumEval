<a href="#0" id="0">As can be seen in the above experiments, there is a strong correlation between the BLEU score and the MT detection accuracy of our method.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In fact, results are linearly and negatively correlated with BLEU, as can be seen both on commercial systems and our in-house SMT systems.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also wish to consider the relationship between detection accuracy and a human quality estimation score.</a>
