<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we consider the problem of hedge parsing , i.e.,, discovering every constituent of length up to some span L.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this section we present our segmentation model which takes the input sentence and chunks it into appropriate segments for hedge parsing.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We use hedge segmentation as a finite-state pre-processing step for hedge context-free parsing.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 1 presents hedge parsing accuracy on the development set for the full parsing baseline, where the output of regular PCFG parsing is transformed to hedges and evaluated, versus parsing with a hedgebank grammar, with no segmentation of the strings.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Table 2 shows the results on the development set when segmenting prior to hedge parsing.</a>
