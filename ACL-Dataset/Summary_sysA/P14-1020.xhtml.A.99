<a href="#1" id="1">In this section, we describe their dense algorithm, which we take as the baseline for our work; we present it in a way that sets up the changes to follow.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">At the top level, the CPU and GPU communicate via a work queue of parse items of the form ( s , i , k , j ) , where s is an identifier of a sentence, i is the start of a span, k is the split point, and j is the end point.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Because of the overhead associated with creating pruning masks and the further overhead of GPU communication, we found that this method did not actually produce any time savings at all.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The result is a parsing speed of 185.5 sentences per second, as shown in Table 1 on the row labeled ‘ Reimpl ’ with ‘ Empty, Coarse ’ pruning.</a>
