<a href="#0" id="0">In this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">As in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator to assign class labels to a set of topics inferred on the unlabeled training documents.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We use the labeled topics to find probability distribution of each training document over the class labels.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">C number of topics on the sprinkled dataset using collapsed Gibbs sampling, where C is the set of class labels of the training documents.</a>
