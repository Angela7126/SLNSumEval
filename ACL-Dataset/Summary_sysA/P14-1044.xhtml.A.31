<a href="#0" id="0">Our approach for aligning lexical resources exploits the graph structure of each resource.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Therefore, we assume that a lexical resource L can be represented as an undirected graph G = ( V , E ) where V is the set of nodes, i.e.,, the concepts defined in the resource, and E is the set of undirected edges, i.e.,, semantic relations between concepts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Each concept c ∈ V is associated with a set of lexicalizations ℒ G ⁢ ( c ) = { w 1 , w 2 , … , w n }.</a>
