<a href="#0" id="0">F i ⁢ j ⁢ k is the number of violations of faithfulness constraint F k by input-output pair type ( x i , y j ) ; M j ⁢ l is the number of violations of markedness constraint M ⋅ l by output candidate y j.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The goal of the IBPOT model is to learn the markedness matrix M and weights w for both the markedness and faithfulness constraints.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We test the model by learning the markedness constraints driving Wolof vowel harmony [].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The model must learn the markedness constraints * \textipa I and Harmony , as well as the weights for all four constraints.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In paradigms where each markedness constraint distinguishes candidates, the learned constraints match the standard constraints.</a>
