<a href="#0" id="0">Focusing on the adaptability to user and domain changes, we report the results of comparative experiments with two online algorithms and the standard batch approach.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The evaluation is carried out by measuring the global error of each algorithm on test sets featuring different degrees of similarity with the data used for training.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our results show that the sensitivity of online QE models to different distributions of training and test instances makes them more suitable than batch methods for integration in a CAT framework.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Intuitively, dealing with simultaneous user and domain changes represents a more challenging problem compared to the previous setting where only post-editors changes were considered.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Such intuition is confirmed by the results of the adaptive models that outperform both the baseline ( Μ ) and the batch models even for low Δ HTER values.</a>
