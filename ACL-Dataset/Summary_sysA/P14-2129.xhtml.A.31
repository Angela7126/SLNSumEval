<a href="#0" id="0">Table 1 presents hedge parsing accuracy on the development set for the full parsing baseline, where the output of regular PCFG parsing is transformed to hedges and evaluated, versus parsing with a hedgebank grammar, with no segmentation of the strings.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We find an order of magnitude speedup of parsing, but at the cost of 3 percent F-measure absolute.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that most of that loss is in recall, indicating that hedges predicted in that condition are nearly as reliable as in full parsing.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Table 2 shows the results on the development set when segmenting prior to hedge parsing.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The first row shows the result with no segmentation, the same as the last row in Table 1 for ease of reference.</a>
