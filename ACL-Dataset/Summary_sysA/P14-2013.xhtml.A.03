<a href="#0" id="0">In our approach we model each possible candidate for every NE mention in a document as a distinct node in a graph and model candidate coherence by links between the nodes.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The solution graph is an undirected graph G = ( V , D ) where V is the node set of all possible NE candidates for different textual mentions in the input document and D is the set of edges between nodes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The local confidence is computed by a similarity measure between the NE mention in the query document and the KB entry of the candidate entity.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The disambiguation phase ranks all nodes in the solution graph and selects the best from the candidate list for each NE textual mention.</a>
