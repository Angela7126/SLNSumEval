<a href="#0" id="0">Our hypothesis is that a model that can even weakly identify recurrent motifs such as ‘ water table ’ or ‘ breaking a fall ’ would be helpful in building more effective semantic representations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We describe learning of the model parameters with fully annotated training data, as well as an approach for learning motif segmentation that requires only partial supervision.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We first quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the performance of the segmentation model, and then evaluate the distributional motif representations learnt by the model through two downstream applications.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The above table shows some of the top results for the unary token ‘ elephant ’ by frequency, and frequent unary and non-unary motifs for the motif ‘ white elephant ’ retrieved by the segmentation model.</a>
