<a href="#0" id="0">A distributional thesaurus is a lexical network that lists semantic neighbours, computed from a corpus and a similarity measure between lexical items, which generally captures the similarity of contexts in which the items occur.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A distributional thesaurus includes a lot of “ noise ” from a semantic point of view, but also lists relevant lexical pairs that escape classical lexical relations such as synonymy or hypernymy.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can draw the tentative conclusion that the quality of distributional relations depends on the contextualizing of the related lexical items, beyond just the similarity score and the ranks of items as neighbours of other items.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We proposed a method to reliably evaluate distributional semantic similarity in a broad sense by considering the validation of lexical pairs in contexts where they both appear.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It seems from these experiments that the quality of distributional relations depends on the contextualizing of the related lexical items, beyond just the similarity score and the ranks of items as neighbours of other items.</a>
