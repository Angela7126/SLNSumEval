<a href="#0" id="0">We frame content selection as a simple classification task given a set of time-series data, decide for each template whether it should be included in a summary or not.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, with the term ‘ template ’ we refer to a quadruple consisting of an id , a factor (bottom left of Table 4 ), a reference type (trend, weeks, average, other) and surface text.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">However, simple classification assumes that the templates are independent of each other, thus the decision for each template is taken in isolation from the others, which is not appropriate for our domain.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to capture the dependencies in the context, multiple simple classifiers can make the decisions for each template iteratively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, the content selection task and the suggested multi-label classification approach are presented.</a>
