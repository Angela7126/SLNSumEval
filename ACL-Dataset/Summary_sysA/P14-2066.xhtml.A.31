<a href="#0" id="0">With the increasing popularity of e-print services such as the arXiv 4 4 http://arxiv.org/ , strength changes in scientific papers are becoming more readily available.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The main contribution of this work is to provide the first large-scale corpus of sentence-level revisions for studying a broad range of variations in statement strength.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We collected labels for a subset of these revisions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Given the possibility of all kinds of disagreement, the fair level of agreement (Fleiss ’ Kappa) among our annotators was decent.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">But in some cases, the labels differed from our expectations, indicating that the general public can interpret the strength of scientific statements differently from researchers.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The participants ’ comments may further shed light on science communication and point to better ways to define and understand strength differences.</a>
