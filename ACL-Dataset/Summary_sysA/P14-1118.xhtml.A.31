<a href="#1" id="1">One of the challenging aspects of sentiment analysis of YouTube data is that the comments may express the sentiment not only towards the product shown in the video, but also the video itself, i.e.,, users may post positive comments to the video while being generally negative about the product and vice versa.</a>
