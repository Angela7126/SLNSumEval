<a href="#0" id="0">Here we formally define the latent variable “ max-violation ” perceptron over a hypergraph for MT training.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Where 1 and 4 are the indexes for reference words “ held ” and “ with ” respectively.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">IWSLT04 is used as development set in MaxForce training, and as tuning set for n -best Mert , Hypergraph Mert , and Pro.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally we also try the “ local-update ” method from \newcite liang+:2006 which updates towards the derivation with the best Bleu + 1 in the root group S [ 0 x.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">On the development set, max-violation update without Word-Edges features achieves Bleu similar to n -best Mert and Pro , but lower than Hypergraph Mert.</a>
