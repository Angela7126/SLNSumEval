<a href="#0" id="0">There has been a considerable amount of research on representing word senses and disambiguating usages of words in context ( wsd ) as, in order to produce computational systems that understand and produce natural language, it is essential to have a means of representing and disambiguating word sense wsd algorithms require word sense information to disambiguate token instances of a given ambiguous word, e.g.,Â in the form of sense definitions [] , semantic relationships [ 17 ] or annotated data [ 20 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">A natural next step for this research would be to couple sense distribution estimation and the detection of unattested senses with evidence from the context, using topics or other information about the local context (e.g., ) to carry out unsupervised wsd of individual token occurrences of a given word.</a>
