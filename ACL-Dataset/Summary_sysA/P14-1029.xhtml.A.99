<a href="#1" id="1">Polarity-based shifting As will be shown in our experiments, negators can have different shifting power when modifying a positive or a negative phrase.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Thus, we explore the use of two different constants for these two situations, i.e.,, f ⁢ ( s ⁢ ( w → ) ) = s ⁢ ( w → ) - s ⁢ i ⁢ g ⁢ n ⁢ ( s ⁢ ( w → ) ) * C ⁢ ( s ⁢ i ⁢ g ⁢ n ⁢ ( s ⁢ ( w → ) ).</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that depending on different purposes, p 1 s ⁢ e ⁢ n can take the value of the automatically predicted sentiment distribution obtained in forward propagation, the gold sentiment annotation of node p 1 , or even other normalized prior sentiment value or confidence score from external sources (e.g.,, sentiment lexicons or external training data.</a>
