<a href="#0" id="0">The second experiment asks participants to label metaphoricity, this time including a distinction between slightly metaphoric and highly metaphoric sentences.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The purpose of this is not to test a three-way distinction in metaphoricity values, but rather to improve the scale by moving intermediate sentences out of the Literal or Metaphoric categories.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The metaphoricity values for this experiment were calculated in the same way the percentage of participants who rated a sentence as highly metaphoric.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, this measurement also is based on the idea that more participants will be consciously aware of highly metaphoric sentences, with a third category available to allow an extra distinction to be made.</a>
