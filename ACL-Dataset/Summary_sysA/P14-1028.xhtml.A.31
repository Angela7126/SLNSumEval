<a href="#0" id="0">To capture more interactions, researchers have designed a large number of features based on linguistic intuition and statistical information.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In previous neural network models, however, hardly can such interactional effects be fully captured relying only on the simple transition score and the single non-linear transformation (See section 2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To model the tag dependency, previous neural network models [ 6 , 35 ] introduce a transition score A i ⁢ j for jumping from tag i ∈ T to tag j ∈ T.</a>
