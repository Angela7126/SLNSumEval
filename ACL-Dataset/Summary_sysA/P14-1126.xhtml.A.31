<a href="#0" id="0">But how can we define the transferring distribution for the parallel examples { 𝒙 i t ∈ P }.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We define the transferring distribution by defining the transferring weight utilizing the English parsing model p Λ E ( 𝒚𝒙 ) via parallel data with word alignments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we propose an unsupervised projective dependency parsing approach for resource-poor languages, using existing resources from a resource-rich source language.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">By presenting a model training framework, our approach can utilize parallel text to estimate transferring distribution with the help of a well-developed resource-rich language dependency parser, and use unlabeled data as entropy regularization.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The experimental results on three data sets across ten target languages show that our approach achieves significant improvement over previous studies.</a>
