<a href="#0" id="0">To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this technique on relation extraction with distant supervision.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">More specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we model the task with a sparse matrix whose rows present items (entity pairs) and columns contain noisy textual features and incomplete relation labels.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In such a way, relation classification is transformed into a problem of completing the unknown labels for testing items in the sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels, based on the assumption that the item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is of low rank.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In practice, we record the rank of matrix Z at each round of iteration until it converges at a rather small threshold Î• = 10 - 4.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The reason is that we suppose the optimal low-rank representation of the matrix Z conveys the truly effective information about underlying semantic correlation between the features and the corresponding labels.</a>
