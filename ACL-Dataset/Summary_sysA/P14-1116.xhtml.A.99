<a href="#0" id="0">We frame content selection as a simple classification task given a set of time-series data, decide for each template whether it should be included in a summary or not.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Secondly, for Decision Tree (with predicted history) , 29 classifiers were also trained, but this time the input included the previous decisions made by the previous classifiers (i.e.,Â the history) as well as the set of time-series data in order to emulate the dependencies in the dataset.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For instance, classifier n was trained using the data from the 9 factors and the template decisions for templates 0 to n - 1.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have shown that ML classification for summarisation of our time-series data has an accuracy of 76.95% and that this approach significantly outperforms other classification methods as it is able to capture dependencies in the data when making content selection decisions.</a>
