<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we presented a model that uses stacked autoencoders to learn grounded meaning representations by simultaneously combining textual and visual modalities.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The two modalities are encoded as vectors of natural language attributes and are obtained automatically from decoupled text and image data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To the best of our knowledge, our model is novel in its use of attribute-based input in a deep neural network.</a>
