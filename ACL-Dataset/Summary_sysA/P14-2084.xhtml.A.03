<a href="#1" id="1">And indeed, all three annotators requested additional context for this comment.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that the misclassifications (with respect to whether comments contain irony or not) made by a standard text classification model significantly correlate with those comments for which human annotators requested additional context.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We analyzed this corpus to provide empirical evidence that annotators quite often require context beyond the comment under consideration to discern irony; especially for those comments ultimately deemed as being intended ironically.</a>
