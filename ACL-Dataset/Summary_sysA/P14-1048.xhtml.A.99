<a href="#0" id="0">Starting from the EDUs on the bottom level, we need to perform inference for one chain on each level during the bottom-up tree-building, and thus the total time complexity is Σ i = 1 m k ⁢ O ⁢ ( m k - i ) = O ⁢ ( m k 2 ).</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The total time to generate sentence-level discourse trees for n sentences is Σ k = 1 n ⁢ O ⁢ ( m k 2.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is fairly safe to assume that each m k is a constant, in the sense that m k is independent of the total number of sentences in the document.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, the total time complexity Σ k = 1 n ⁢ O ⁢ ( m k 2 ) ≤ n × O ⁢ ( max 1 ≤ j ≤ n ⁡ ( m j 2 ) ) = n × O ⁢ ( 1 ) = O ⁢ ( n ) , i.e.,, linear in the total number of sentences.</a>
