<a href="#0" id="0">We have presented an unsupervised framework for abstractive summarization of spoken and written conversations based on phrasal queries.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For content selection, we propose a sentence extraction model that incorporates query relevance and content importance into the extraction process.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the generation phase, we propose a ranking strategy which selects the best path in the constructed word graph based on fluency, query relevance and content.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Both automatic and manual evaluation of our model show substantial improvement over extraction-based methods, including Biased LexRank, which is considered a state-of-the-art system.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Moreover, our system also yields good grammaticality score for human evaluation and achieves comparable scores with the original sentences.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our future work is four-fold.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">First, we are trying to improve our model by incorporating conversational features (e.g.,, speech acts.</a>
