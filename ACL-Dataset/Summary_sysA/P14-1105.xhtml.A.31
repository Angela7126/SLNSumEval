<a href="#0" id="0">Building from those insights, we introduce a recursive neural network ( rnn ) to detect ideological bias on the sentence level.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This model requires richer data than currently available, so we develop a new political ideology dataset annotated at the phrase level.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">With this new dataset we show that rnn s not only label sentences well but also improve further when given additional phrase-level annotations rnn s are quantitatively more effective than existing methods that use syntactic and semantic features separately, and we also illustrate how our model correctly identifies ideological bias in complex syntactic constructions.</a>
