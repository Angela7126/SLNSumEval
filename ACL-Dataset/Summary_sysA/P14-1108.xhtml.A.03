<a href="#1" id="1">We learnt the generalized language models on the same split of the training corpus as the standard language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and we also used the same set of test sequences for a direct comparison.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then we trained a generalized language model as well as a standard language model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on each of these samples of the training data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As the size of the training data set becomes smaller (even smaller than the evaluation data), the GLM achieves a reduction of perplexity of up to 25.7 ‚Å¢ % compared to language models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on the same data set.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have introduced a novel generalized language model as the systematic combination of skip n -grams and modified Kneser-Ney smoothing.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our experiments underline that the generalized language models overcome in particular the weaknesses of modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on sparse training data.</a>
