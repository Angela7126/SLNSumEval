<a href="#2" id="2">We hypothesize that two nouns with some particular semantic relations are more likely to constitute event causality.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Below we describe the semantic relations that we believe are likely to constitute event causality.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Binary pattern of our semantic relations that co-occurs with two nouns of an event causality candidate in our web corpus.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">They ranked event causality candidates by C ⁢ s ⁢ ( p 1 , p 2 ) s 1.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Note that some event causality candidates were not given excitation values for their templates, since some templates were acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto et al ’ s method.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We proposed a supervised method for event causality extraction that exploits semantic relation, context, and association features.</a>
