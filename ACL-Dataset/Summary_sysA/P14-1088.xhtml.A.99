<a href="#0" id="0">Let the function LAS ⁢ ( t 1 , t 2 ) be the number of tokens with the same head and label in the two trees t 1 and t 2 , T ⁢ ( i ) the set of trees possible for an item i ∈ I , and tokens the number of tokens in the corpus.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Synthetic experiments do not always fully reflect real-world behaviour, however.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore we will also evaluate our metrics on real-world inter-annotator agreement data sets.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In our evaluation, we will contrast labelled accuracy, the standard parser evaluation metric, and our three Α metrics.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When there are more than two annotators, we generalise the metric to be the average pairwise LAS for each sentence, weighted by the length of the sentence.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Let LAS ⁢ ( t 1 , t 2 ) be the fraction of tokens with identical head and label in the trees t 1 and t 2 ; the pairwise labelled accuracy LAS p ⁢ ( X ) of a set of annotations X as described in section 1.2 is.</a>
