<a href="#0" id="0">In this work, we compare our system to topic word based ones since the latter is also a general method to find surprising new words in a set of input documents but is not a bayesian approach.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first compute a surprise value for each word type in the summarization input.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Surprise is computed based on the changes in probabilities of all of these hypotheses upon seeing the summarization input ii) The computation of topic words is local, it assumes a binomial distribution and the occurrence of a word is independent of others.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Here we describe the input sets and background corpus used for the two summarization tasks and define the prior distribution for each.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In practice for both tasks, a new summarization input can have words unseen in the background.</a>
