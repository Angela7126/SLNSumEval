<a href="#1" id="1">We define the transferring distribution by defining the transferring weight utilizing the English parsing model p Λ E ( 𝒚𝒙 ) via parallel data with word alignments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Train a parsing model for the target language by minimizing the objective K ′ function which is the combination of expected negative log-likelihood on parallel and unlabeled data.</a>
