<a href="#0" id="0">We have proposed a general-purpose Naive Bayes model for measuring association between two sets of random events.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The model replaced string matching in the Lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation with a probabilistic measure of gloss-context overlap.</a>
