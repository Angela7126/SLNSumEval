<a href="#0" id="0">Increasing m or stacking multiple convolutional layers of the narrow type makes the range of the feature detectors larger; at the same time it also exacerbates the neglect of the margins of the sentence and increases the minimum size s of the input sentence required by the convolution.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">So far we have described how one applies a wide convolution, a (dynamic) k -max pooling layer and a non-linear function to the input sentence matrix to obtain a first order feature map.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We denote a feature map of the i -th order by 𝐅 i.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As in convolutional networks for object recognition, to increase the number of learnt feature detectors of a certain order, multiple feature maps 𝐅 1 i , … , 𝐅 n i may be computed in parallel at the same layer.</a>
