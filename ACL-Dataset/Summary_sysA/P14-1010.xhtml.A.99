<a href="#0" id="0">Other approaches train an SMT system to predict lemmas instead of surface forms, and then inflect the SMT output as a post-processing step [ 21 , 7 , 11 , 10 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Alternatively, one can reparameterize existing phrase tables as exponential models, so that translation probabilities account for source context and morphological features [ 16 , 30 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Equation 1 may need to be modified for other languages or segmentation schemes, but our techniques generalize to any definition that can be written as a regular expression.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A desegmenting transducer can be constructed by first encoding our desegmenter as a table that maps morpheme sequences to words.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Regardless of whether the original desegmenter was based on concatenation, rules or table-lookup, it can be encoded as a lattice-specific table by applying it to an enumeration of all words found in the lattice.</a>
