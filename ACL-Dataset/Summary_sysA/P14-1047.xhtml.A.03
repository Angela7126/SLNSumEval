<a href="#0" id="0">So far research on using RL for dialogue policy learning has focused on single-agent RL techniques.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this case the environment of a learning agent is one or more other agents that can also be learning at the same time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As mentioned in section 1 , there are three main approaches to the problem of learning dialogue policies using RL.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus the environment of an agent is one or more other agents that continuously change their behavior because they are also learning at the same time.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus the reward for Agent 1 is 1190, the reward for Agent 2 is 1190, and the average reward of the two agents is also 1190.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We used single-agent RL and multi-agent RL for learning dialogue policies in a resource allocation negotiation scenario.</a>
