<a href="#0" id="0">On the basis of a case study of the construction “ V the hell out of NP ” , I show how distributional semantics can profitably be applied to the study of syntactic productivity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To answer these questions, I will analyze the distribution of the construction from a semantic point of view by using a measure of semantic similarity derived from distributional information.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The resulting matrix, which contains the distributional information (in 4,683 columns) for 92 verbs occurring in the hell -construction, constitutes the semantic space under consideration in this case study.</a>
