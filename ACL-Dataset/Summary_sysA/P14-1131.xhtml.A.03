<a href="#0" id="0">In Section 4 , we compare CoSimRank and SimRank.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">CoSimRank can either be interpreted as an efficient version of SimRank or as a version of Personalized PageRank for similarity measurement.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Later on, we will give a matrix formulation to compare CoSimRank with SimRank.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">If d k , then the time complexity of CoSimRank is ùí™‚Å¢ ( k 2 ‚Å¢ n.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In summary, CoSimRank and SimRank have similar space and time complexities for computing all n 2 similarities.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We propose CoSimRank as an efficient algorithm for computing the similarity of nodes in a graph.</a>
