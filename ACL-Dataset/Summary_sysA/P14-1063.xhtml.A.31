<a href="#0" id="0">In general, if V features are defined for a learning problem, and we (i) organize the feature set as a tensor 𝚽∈ℝ n 1 × n 2 × …⁢ n D and (ii) use H component rank-1 tensors to approximate the corresponding target weight tensor.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then the total number of parameters to be learned for this tensor model is H ⁢∑ d = 1 D n d , which is usually much smaller than V = ∏ d = 1 D n d for a traditional vector space model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore we expect the tensor model to be more effective in a low-resource training environment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Hence { x 1 , … , x n } can also be represented by a D th order tensor 𝒬′∎.</a>
