<a href="#0" id="0">By using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and relations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, Paralex [ 7 ] , with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We adapt the work of [ 8 , 15 ] for measuring the semantic distance between a question and relational triples in the KB as the core component of our semantic parsing approach.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we focus on using a knowledge base to answer single-relation questions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Compared to the existing work, our key insight is to match relation patterns and entity mentions using a semantic similarity function rather than lexical rules.</a>
