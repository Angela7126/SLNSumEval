<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we equip DCS with logical inference , which, in one point of view, is “ the best way of testing an NLP system ’ s semantic capacity ” [].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this section we describe the idea of representing natural language semantics by DCS trees, and achieving inference by computing logical relations among the corresponding abstract denotations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For example, the abstract denotation of germ 𝙰𝚁𝙶⁢ ( 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 ) in Figure 1 is defined as Π𝙰𝚁𝙶⁢ ( 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤∩Π𝙾𝙱𝙹⁢ ( 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝∩ ( 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝚂𝚄𝙱𝙹 × 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤𝙾𝙱𝙹 ) ) ) , meaning “ books read by students ”.</a>
