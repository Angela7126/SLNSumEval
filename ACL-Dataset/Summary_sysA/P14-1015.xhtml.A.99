<a href="#0" id="0">Being supervised methods, the above assumptions are implicitly factored in by including the appropriate feature (e.g.,, post position in thread) in the feature space so that the learner may learn the correlation (e.g.,, solution posts typically are among the first few posts) using the training data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The only unsupervised approach for the task, that from [ 4 ] , uses a graph propagation method on a graph modeled using posts as vertices, and relies on the assumptions that posts that bear high similarity to the problem and other posts and those authored by authoritative users are more likely to be solution posts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Usage of translation models for modeling the correlation between textual problems and solutions have been explored earlier starting from the answer retrieval work in [ 18 ] where new queries were conceptually expanded using the translation model to improve retrieval.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In short, our empirical analysis illustrates the superior performance and establishes our method as the method of choice for unsupervised solution identification.</a>
