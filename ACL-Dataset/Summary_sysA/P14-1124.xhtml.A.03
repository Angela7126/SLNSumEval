<a href="#0" id="0">The word error rate (WER) and term detection performance are clearly correlated.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We evaluate term detection and word repetition-based re-scoring on the IARPA BABEL training and development corpora 1 1 Language collection releases IARPA-babel101-v0.4c, IARPA-babel104b-v0.4bY, IARPA-babel105b-v0.4, IARPA-babel106-v0.2g and IARPA-babel107b-v0.7 respectively for five languages Cantonese, Pashto, Turkish, Tagalog and Vietnamese [].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We seek a workable definition of broad document context beyond N-gram models that will improve term detection performance on an arbitrary set of queries.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The primary difference between this and previous work on similar language models is the narrower focus here on the term detection task, in which we consider each search term in isolation, rather than all words in the vocabulary.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In general, we can think of using word repetitions to re-score term detection as applying a limited form of adaptive or cache language model [].</a>
