<a href="#1" id="1">Given the two adjacent roles 𝑅 i and 𝑅 i + 1 in a PAS pas , Table 2 shows the features that are used in the semantic leftmost and rightmost reordering models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The syntactic reordering models outperform the semantic reordering models on both the baseline and MR08 systems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Finally, we integrate both the syntactic and semantic reordering models into the final system.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">And we again see that the improvement achieved by semantic reordering models is limited in the presence of the syntactic reordering models.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The syntactic reordering models take CFG rules and model their reordering on the target side, while the semantic reordering models work with PAS.</a>
