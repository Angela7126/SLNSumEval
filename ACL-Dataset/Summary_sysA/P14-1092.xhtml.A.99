<a href="#0" id="0">[ 22 ] recently addressed the problem of answer sentence selection and demonstrated that LS models, including recurrent neural network language models (RNNLM), have a higher contribution to overall performance than exploiting syntactic analysis.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The ensemble model without LS (third line) has a nearly identical P@1 score as the equivalent in-domain model (line 13 in Table 1), while slightly surpassing in-domain MRR performance.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most striking demonstrations of domain transfer in answer ranking for non-factoid QA, and highlights the generality of these discourse features in identifying answer structures across domains and genres.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple genres and question types and obtain benefits of up to 24% relative improvement over a strong baseline that combines information retrieval and lexical semantics.</a>
