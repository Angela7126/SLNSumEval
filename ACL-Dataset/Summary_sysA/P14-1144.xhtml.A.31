<a href="#1" id="1">We form two types of features from prompt adherence keywords.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">While both types of features measure how much each prompt component was discussed in an essay, they differ in how they encode the information.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To obtain feature values of the first type, we take the RI similarities between the whole essay and each set of prompt adherence keywords from the prompt ’ s components.</a>
