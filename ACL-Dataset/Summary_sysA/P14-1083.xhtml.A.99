<a href="#0" id="0">Our experimental results show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for response-based learning over standard structured learning from reference translations.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We show in an error analysis that this improvement can be attributed to using structural and lexical variants of reference translations as positive examples in response-based learning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Recent approaches to machine learning for SMT formalize the task of discriminating good from bad translations as a structured prediction problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Assume a joint feature representation Φ⁢ ( x , y ) of input sentences x and output translations y ∈ Y ⁢ ( x ) , and a linear scoring function s ⁢ ( x , y ; w ) for predicting a translation y ^ (where ⟨⋅ , ⋅⟩ denotes the standard vector dot product) s.t.</a>
