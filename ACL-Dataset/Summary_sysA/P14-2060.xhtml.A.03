<a href="#1" id="1">To predict the expansion given the context, we extract n-gram observations for full words in the TTS lexicon.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">For the “ SVM ” model, we extract features from the log likelihood and log odds scores associated with contextual n-grams, as well as from the pair LM probability and characteristics of the abbreviation itself.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">To report true and false positive rates for the N-gram system we would need to select an arbitrary decision threshold operating point, unlike the deterministic TTS baseline and the SVM model with its decision threshold of 0.</a>
