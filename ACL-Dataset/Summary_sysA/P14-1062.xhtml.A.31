<a href="#0" id="0">The convolutional layers apply one-dimensional filters across each row of features in the sentence matrix.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Convolving the same filter with the n -gram at every position in the sentence allows the features to be extracted independently of their position in the sentence.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A convolutional layer followed by a dynamic pooling layer and a non-linearity form a feature map.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Like in the convolutional networks for object recognition [] , we enrich the representation in the first layer by computing multiple feature maps with different filters applied to the input sentence.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Subsequent layers also have multiple feature maps computed by convolving filters with all the maps from the layer below.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The weights at these layers form an order-4 tensor.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The resulting architecture is dubbed a Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">The Max-TDNN sentence model is based on the architecture of a TDNN [].</a>
