<a href="#0" id="0">Multi-modal models in which perceptual input is filtered according to our algorithm learn higher-quality semantic representations than previous approaches, resulting in a significant performance improvement of up to 17% in capturing the semantic similarity of concepts.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The filtering approach described thus far improves multi-modal representations because image dispersion provides a means to distinguish concrete concepts from more abstract concepts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We presented a novel method, image dispersion-based filtering, that improves multi-modal representations by approximating conceptual concreteness from images and filtering model input.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The results clearly show that including more perceptual input in multi-modal models is not always better.</a>
