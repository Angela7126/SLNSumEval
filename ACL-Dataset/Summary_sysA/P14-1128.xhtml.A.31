<a href="#0" id="0">This paper proposes an alternative Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) model adapted to the SMT task, which seeks not only to maintain the advantages of a monolingual supervised model, having hand-annotated linguistic knowledge, but also to assimilate the relevant bilingual segmentation nature.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We propose leveraging the bilingual knowledge to form learning constraints that guide a supervised segmentation model toward a better solution for SMT.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Besides the bilingual motivated models, character-based alignment is also employed to achieve the mappings of the successive Chinese characters and the target language words.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Instead of directly merging the characters into concrete segmentations, this work attempts to extract word boundary distributions for character-level trigrams (types) from the “ chars-to-word ” mappings.</a>
