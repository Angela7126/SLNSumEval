<a href="#0" id="0">This paper reports the first attempt at using a distributional measure of semantic similarity derived from a vector-space model for the study of syntactic productivity in diachrony.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">On the basis of a case study of the construction “ V the hell out of NP ” from 1930 to 2009, the advantages of this approach were demonstrated.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Not only does distributional semantics provide an empirically-based measure of semantic similarity that appropriately captures semantic distinctions, it also enables the use of methods for which quantification is necessary, such as data visualization and statistical analysis.</a>
