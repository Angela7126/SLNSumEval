<a href="#0" id="0">Our method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Induce both semantic frames and verb classes from a massive amount of verb uses by a scalable method.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Then, we induce verb classes by clustering these verb-specific semantic frames across verbs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Induce verb classes by clustering the induced semantic frames across verbs as shown in the upper part of Figure 1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We induce verb-specific semantic frames from verb uses based on the method of Kawahara et al.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">To induce verb classes across verbs, we apply clustering to the induced verb-specific semantic frames.</a>
