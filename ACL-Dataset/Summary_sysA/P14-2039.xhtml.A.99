<a href="#0" id="0">Although this method speeds the search for the best alignment, it introduces a significant number of errors to the output of the system due to inconsistency at the boundaries of the chunks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We are interested in investigating how the three key parameters of the algorithm, i.e.,, the chunk size ( c ), the heuristic weight ( w ) and the keep-length ( k ), affect the system latency, the search speed, and the alignment accuracy.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">By effectively addressing the problem of alignment errors at chunk boundaries, our sliding window approach outperforms the existing fixed window based system [] in terms of word error rate, particularly when the chunk size is small, and thus achieves higher accuracy at lower latency.</a>
