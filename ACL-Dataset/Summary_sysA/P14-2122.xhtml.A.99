<a href="#0" id="0">P ( ℱ k k ′ℱ , ℳ ) is the marginal probability of all the possible F ∈ℱ that contain ℱ k k ′ as a word, which can be calculated efficiently through dynamic programming (the process is similar to the foreward-backward algorithm in training a hidden Markov model (HMM) [].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The proposed method does not require any annotated data, but the SMT system with it can achieve comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised word segmenters trained on precious annotated data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, the proposed method yields 0.96 BLEU improvement relative to supervised word segmenters on an out-of-domain corpus.</a>
