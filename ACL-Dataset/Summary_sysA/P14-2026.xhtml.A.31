<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we introduced a novel pre-ordering approach based on dependency parsing for a Chinese-English PBSMT system.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The results showed that our approach achieved a BLEU score gain of 1.61.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Moreover, our dependency-based pre-ordering rule set substantially decreased the time for applying pre-ordering rules about 60% compared with WR07, on the training set of 1M sentences pairs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The overall accuracy of our rule set is 60.0%, which is almost at the same level as the WR07 rule set.</a>
