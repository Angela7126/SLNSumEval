<a href="#0" id="0">A consequence of focusing on all relations is a shift from the traditional temporal relation classification task, where the system is given a pair of events and asked only to label the type of temporal relation, to a temporal relation identification task, where the system must determine for itself which events in the document to pair up.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In contrast, we aim for a shift in the community wherein all pairs are considered candidates for temporal ordering, allowing researchers to ask questions such as how must algorithms adapt to label the complete graph of pairs, and if the more difficult and ambiguous event pairs are included, how must feature-based learners change.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We lean toward higher annotator agreement with relations that have greater separation between their semantics 4 4 For instance, a relation like starts is a special case of includes if events are viewed as open intervals, and immediately before is a special case of before.</a>
