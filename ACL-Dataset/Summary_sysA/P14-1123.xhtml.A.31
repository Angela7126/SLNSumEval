<a href="#0" id="0">The focus of this study is the design and performance analysis of a measure of the syntactic complexity of non-native English responses for use in automatic scoring systems.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The state-of-the art automated scoring system for spontaneous speech [ 38 , 15 ] currently uses measures of fluency and pronunciation (acoustic aspects) to produce scores that are in reasonable agreement with human-rated scores of proficiency.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We show that the measure of syntactic complexity derived from a shallow-analysis of spoken utterances satisfies the design constraint of high discriminative ability between proficiency levels.</a>
