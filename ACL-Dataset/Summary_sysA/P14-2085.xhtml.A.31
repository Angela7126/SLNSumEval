<a href="#0" id="0">We have described a new, context-aware approach to automatically predicting aspectual class, including a new set of distributional features.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We have also introduced two new data sets of clauses labeled for aspectual class.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our experiments show that in any setting where labeled training data is available, improvement over the most frequent class baseline can only be reached by integrating instance-based features, though type-based features (LingInd, Dist) may provide useful priors for some verbs and successfully predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In order to arrive at a globally well-performing system, we envision a multi-stage approach, treating verbs differently according to whether training data is available and whether or not the verb â€™ s aspectual class distribution is highly skewed.</a>
