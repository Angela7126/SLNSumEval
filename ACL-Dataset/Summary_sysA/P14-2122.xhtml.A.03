<a href="#0" id="0">However, bilingual approaches that model word probabilities suffer from computational complexity.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">[] proposed a bilingual method by adding alignment into the generative model, but was only able to test it on small-scale BTEC data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This section describes our unified monolingual and bilingual UWS scheme.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We now look in more detail at the complexity of the expectation calculation in monolingual and bilingual models.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Two monolingual corpora and two bilingual corpora are used (Table 2.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The proposed method with monolingual bigram model performed poorly on the Chinese monolingual segmentation task; thus, it was not tested.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The time cost of the bilingual models is about 5 times that of the monolingual model, which is consistent with the complexity analysis in Section 3.</a>
