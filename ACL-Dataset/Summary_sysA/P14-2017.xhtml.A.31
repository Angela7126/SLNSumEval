<a href="#0" id="0">The changes undergone by words when entering from one language into another and the transformation rules they follow have been successfully employed in various approaches to cognate detection [ 18 , 25 , 28 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">These orthographic changes have also been used in cognate production, which is closely related to the task of cognate detection, but has not yet been as intensively studied.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper we proposed a method for automatic detection of cognates based on orthographic alignment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We employed the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [ 29 ] for sequence alignment widely-used in computational biology and we used aligned pairs of words to extract rules for lexical changes occurring when words enter new languages.</a>
