<a href="#0" id="0">Inspired by [ 36 ] and [ 14 ] , we adopt the graph model for Chinese spell checking for pinyin segmentation and typo correction, which is based on the shortest path word segmentation algorithm [ 1 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Given HMM decoding problem is identical to SSSP problem on DAG, we propose a joint graph model for PTC conversion with typo correction.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The joint graph model aims to find the global optimal for both PTC conversion and typo correction on the entire input pinyin sequence.</a>
