<a href="#0" id="0">Multi-agent RL is designed to work for non-stationary environments.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this case the environment of a learning agent is one or more other agents that can also be learning at the same time.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Therefore, unlike single-agent RL, multi-agent RL can handle changes in user behavior or in the behavior of other agents participating in the interaction, and thus potentially lead to more realistic dialogue policies in complex dialogue scenarios.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This ability of multi-agent RL can also have important implications for learning via live interaction with human users.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We used single-agent RL and multi-agent RL for learning dialogue policies in a resource allocation negotiation scenario.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Two agents interacted with each other and both learned at the same time.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The advantage of this approach is that it does not require SUs to train against or corpora to learn from.</a>
