<a href="#0" id="0">Our simple reranking strategy for self-monitoring is to rerank the realizer ’ s n -best list by parse accuracy, preserving the original order in case of ties.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this way, if there is a realization in the n -best list that can be parsed more accurately than the top-ranked realization — even if the intended interpretation cannot be recovered with 100% accuracy — it will become the preferred output of the combined realization-with-self-monitoring system.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this paper, we have shown that while using parse accuracy in a simple reranking strategy for self-monitoring fails to improve BLEU scores over a state-of-the-art averaged perceptron realization ranking model, it is possible to significantly increase BLEU scores using an SVM ranker that combines the realizer ’ s model score together with features from multiple parsers, including ones designed to make the ranker more robust to parsing mistakes that human readers would be unlikely to make.</a>
