<a href="#0" id="0">In this setting, we assume that our system possesses linguistic and visual information for a set of concepts in the form of text-based representations of words and image-based vectors of the corresponding objects, used for vision-to-language-mapping training.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">2013 ) use linear regression to transform vector-based image representations onto vectors representing the same concepts in linguistic semantic space.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The process of learning to map objects to the their word label is implemented by training a projection function f proj v → w from the visual onto the linguistic semantic space.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For the learning, we use a set of N s seen concepts for which we have both image-based visual representations 𝐕 s ∈ℝ N s × d v and text-based linguistic representations 𝐖 s ∈ℝ N s × d w.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We implement this second setup ( w → v ) by training the projection function f proj w → v which maps linguistic vectors to visual ones.</a>
