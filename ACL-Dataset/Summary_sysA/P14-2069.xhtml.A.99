<a href="#0" id="0">The proposed EaLDA model extends the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 3 ] model by employing a small set of seeds to guide the model generating topics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Hence, the topics consequently group semantically related words into a same emotion category.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">1) we perform a case study for the lexicon generated by our algorithm, and (2) we compare the results of solving emotion classification task using our lexicon against different methods, and demonstrate the advantage of our lexicon over other lexicons and other emotion classification systems.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These domain-specific words are mostly not included in any other existing general-purpose emotion lexicons.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The experimental results show that our algorithm can successfully construct a fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon for this corpus that is able to understand the connotation of the words that may not be obvious without the context.</a>
