<a href="#0" id="0">First, we represent a document as a nested tree , which is composed of two types of tree structures a document tree and a sentence tree.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The document tree is a tree that has sentences as nodes and head modifier relationships between sentences obtained by RST as edges.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Figure 4 has two example sentences for which both methods selected a subtree as part of a summary.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The { ⋅ } indicates the parser ’ s root word.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The [ ⋅ ] indicates the word that the system selected as the root of the subtree.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Subtree selection selected a root in both examples that differed from the parser ’ s root.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">As we can see, subtree selection only selected important subtrees that did not include the parser ’ s root, e.g.,, purpose-clauses and that-clauses.</a>
