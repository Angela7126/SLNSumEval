<a href="#1" id="1">[] addressed this alignment problem using off-the-shelf multiple sequence alignment tools, as well as an algorithm based on incrementally building a precedence graph over output words.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Improved results for the alignment problem were shown using weighted A * search by Naim et al.</a>

<a href="#4" id="4">To speed the search for the best alignment, Naim et al.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">[] divided sequences into chunks of a fixed time duration, and applied the A * alignment algorithm to each chunk independently.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Although this method speeds the search for the best alignment, it introduces a significant number of errors to the output of the system due to inconsistency at the boundaries of the chunks.</a>
