<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we present a novel approach for semantic parsing based on paraphrasing that can exploit large amounts of text not covered by the KB (Figure 1.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our approach targets factoid questions with a modest amount of compositionality.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Given an input utterance, we first use a simple deterministic procedure to construct a manageable set of candidate logical forms (ideally, we would generate canonical utterances for all possible logical forms, but this is intractable.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Next, we heuristically generate canonical utterances for each logical form based on the text descriptions of predicates from the KB.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Finally, we choose the canonical utterance that best paraphrases the input utterance, and thereby the logical form that generated it.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We use two complementary paraphrase models an association model based on aligned phrase pairs extracted from a monolingual parallel corpus, and a vector space model , which represents each utterance as a vector and learns a similarity score between them.</a>
