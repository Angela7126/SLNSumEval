<a href="#1" id="1">Next, we evaluate STRUCT ’ s ability to generate sentences with nested subclauses.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">An example of such a sentence is “ The dog which ate the treat chased the cat ” This is a difficult sentence to generate for several reasons.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The first, and clearest, is that there are words in the sentence which do not help to increase the score assigned to the partial sentence.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Notably, we must adjoin the word “ which ” to “ the dog ” during the portion of generation where the sentence reads “ the dog chased the cat ”.</a>
