<a href="#0" id="0">Our goal is to use surface features to replicate the functionality of other annotations, without increasing the state space of our grammar, meaning that the rules rule ⁢ ( r ) remain simple, as does the state space used during inference.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">One probable reason for this is that our parser already includes monolexical features that inspect the first and last words of each span, which captures the syntactic or the semantic head in many cases or can otherwise provide information about what the constituent ’ s type may be and how it is likely to combine.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Syntax is often driven by heads of constituents, which tend to be located at the beginning or the end, whereas sentiment is more likely to depend on modifiers such as adjectives, which are typically present in the middle of spans.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, we augment our existing model with standard sentiment analysis features that look at unigrams and bigrams in the span [ 31 ].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We exploit this by adding an additional feature template similar to our span shape feature from Section 4.4 which uses the (deterministic) tag for each word as its descriptor.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We evaluated our model on the fine-grained sentiment analysis task presented in Socher et al.</a>
