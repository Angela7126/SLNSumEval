<a href="#0" id="0">The web-feature module, shown in the lower left part of Figure 1, consists of a input layer and two hidden layers.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The input for the this module is the word n-gram ( w i - l , â€¦ , w i + r ) , the form of which is identical to the training data of the pre-trained WRRBM.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We built a web-domain POS tagger using a two-phase approach.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We used a WRRBM to learn the representation of the web text and incorporate the representation in a neural network, which is trained using guided learning for easy-first POS tagging.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Experiment showed that our approach achieved significant improvement in tagging the web domain text.</a>
