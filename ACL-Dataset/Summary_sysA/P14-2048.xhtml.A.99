<a href="#0" id="0">We conduct the same classification experiment as above, with features based on function words and POS tags, and SMO-based SVM as the classifier.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We first use 3000 reference sentences from the WMT13 â€™ English reference translations, against the matching 3000 output sentences from one MT system at a time, resulting in 6000 sentence instances per experiment.</a>
