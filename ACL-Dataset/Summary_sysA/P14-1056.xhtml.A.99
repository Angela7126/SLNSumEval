<a href="#0" id="0">On a new, more broadly representative, and challenging citation field extraction data set, we show that our methods achieve a 17.9% reduction in error versus a linear-chain conditional random field.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The algorithms we present in later sections for handling soft global constraints and for learning the penalties of these constraints can be applied to general structured linear models, not just CRFs, provided we have an available algorithm for performing MAP inference.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In this case, the MAP problem can be formulated as a structured linear model similar to equation ( 1 ), for which we have a MAP algorithm, but where we have imposed some additional constraints A ⁢ y ≤ b that no longer allow us to use the algorithm.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An important property of problem ( 5 ) in the previous section is that it corresponds to a structured linear model over y and z.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">A similar analysis holds for the structured SVM approach.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Therefore, we can view learning the values of the penalties not just as parameter tuning, but as a means to perform ‘ constraint selection, ’ since constraints that have a penalty of 0 can be ignored.</a>
