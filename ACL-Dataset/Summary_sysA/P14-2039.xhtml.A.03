<a href="#1" id="1">[] divided the sequences into chunks of a fixed time duration, and applied the A * alignment algorithm to each chunk independently.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We also compare the performance of our algorithm with that of the most accurate fixed alignment window algorithm [].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The other systems are the graph-based algorithm of [] , the MUSCLE algorithm of [] , and the most accurate fixed alignment window algorithm of [].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">By effectively addressing the problem of alignment errors at chunk boundaries, our sliding window approach outperforms the existing fixed window based system [] in terms of word error rate, particularly when the chunk size is small, and thus achieves higher accuracy at lower latency.</a>
