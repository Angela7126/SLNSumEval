<a href="#0" id="0">Our previous method based on web mining [ 8 ] works well for hypernym extraction of entity names, but it is unsuitable for semantic hierarchy construction which involves many words with broad semantics.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Then we elaborate on our proposed method composed of three major steps, namely, word embedding training, projection learning, and hypernym â€“ hyponym relation identification.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">2013a ) propose two log-linear models, namely the Skip-gram and CBOW model, to efficiently induce word embeddings.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">These two models can be trained very efficiently on a large-scale corpus because of their low time complexity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2.</a>
