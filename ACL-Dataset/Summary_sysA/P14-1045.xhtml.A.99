<a href="#0" id="0">They are not suitable for the evaluation of the whole range of semantic relatedness that is exhibited by distributional similarities, which exceeds the limits of classical lexical relations, even though researchers have tried to collect equivalent resources manually, to be used as a gold standard [].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">One advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessarily standard lexical relations.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">It is not easy to decide if the non-relevant pairs are just noise, or context-dependent associations that were not present in the actual text considered (for polysemy reasons for instance), or just low-level associations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">An important aspect is thus to guarantee that there is a correlation between the similarity score (Lin â€™ s score here), and the evaluated relevance of the neighbour pairs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The filtering approach we propose seems to yield good results, by augmenting the similarity built on the whole corpus with signals from the local contexts and documents where related lexical items appear together.</a>
