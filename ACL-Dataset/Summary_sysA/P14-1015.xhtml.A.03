<a href="#0" id="0">We will use translation and language models in our method for solution identification.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Consider a unigram language model 𝒮 S that models the lexical characteristics of solution posts, and a translation model 𝒯 S that models the lexical correlation between problems and solutions.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">F ⁢ ( ( p , r ) , 𝒮 , 𝒯 ) indicates the conformance of the ( p , r ) pair (details in Section 4.3.1 ) with the generative model that uses the 𝒮 and 𝒯 models as the language and translation models respectively.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In short, our approach is a 2-way clustering algorithm that uses two pairs of models, [ 𝒮 S , 𝒯 S ] and [ 𝒮 N , 𝒯 N ] , to model solution pairs and non-solution pairs respectively.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As may be obvious from the ensuing discussion, those pairs labeled as solution pairs are used to learn the 𝒮 S and 𝒯 S models and those labeled as non-solution pairs are used to learn the models with subscript N.</a>
