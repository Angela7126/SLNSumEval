<a href="#0" id="0">Additionally, on top of a simpler decoder equivalent to Chiang ’ s [ 5 ] original Hiero implementation, our NNJM features are able to produce an improvement of +6.3 BLEU – as much as all of the other features in our strong baseline system combined.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The baseline used in the last section is a highly-engineered research system, which uses a wide array of features that were refined over a number of years, and some of which require linguistic resources.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Because of this, the baseline BLEU scores are much higher than a typical MT system – especially a real-time, production engine which must support many language pairs.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Therefore, we also present results using a simpler version of our decoder which emulates Chiang ’ s original Hiero implementation [ 5 ].</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Le ’ s model also uses minimal phrases rather than being purely lexicalized, which has two main downsides a) a number of complex, hand-crafted heuristics are required to define phrase boundaries, which may not transfer well to new languages, (b) the effective vocabulary size is much larger, which substantially increases data sparsity issues.</a>
