<a href="#1" id="1">The answer to the question can thus be derived by finding the relation – entity triple r ⁢ ( e 1 , e 2 ) in the KB and returning the entity not mentioned in the question.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The mapping between the pattern and the relation in the KB, as well as the mapping between the mention and the entity are determined by corresponding semantic similarity models.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We train two CNN semantic models from sets of pattern – relation and mention – entity pairs, respectively.</a>
