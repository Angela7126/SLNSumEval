<a href="#0" id="0">It is similar to direct transfer in that we also use a shared feature representation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Instead of designing this representation manually, however, we create compact monolingual feature representations for source and target languages separately and automatically estimate the mapping between the two from parallel data.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">This allows us to make use of language-specific annotations and account for the interplay between different types of information.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, a certain preposition attached to a token in the source language might map into a morphological tag in the target language, which would be hard to handle for traditional direct model transfer other than using some kind of refinement procedure involving parallel data.</a>
