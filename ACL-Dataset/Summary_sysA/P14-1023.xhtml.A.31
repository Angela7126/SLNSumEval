<a href="#0" id="0">Table 2 summarizes the evaluation results.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The first block of the table reports the maximum per-task performance (across all considered parameter settings) for count and predict vectors.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The latter emerge as clear winners, with a large margin over count vectors in most tasks.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Indeed, the predictive models achieve an impressive overall performance, beating the current state of the art in several cases, and approaching it in many more.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">It is worth stressing that, as reviewed in Section 3 , the state-of-the-art results were obtained in almost all cases using specialized approaches that rely on external knowledge, manually-crafted rules, parsing, larger corpora and/or task-specific tuning.</a>
