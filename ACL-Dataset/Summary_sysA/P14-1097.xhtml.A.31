<a href="#1" id="1">To induce verb classes across verbs, we apply clustering to the induced verb-specific semantic frames.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We can use exactly the same clustering method as described in Section 3.2.3 by using semantic frames for multiple verbs as an input instead of initial frames for a single verb.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is because an initial frame has the same structure as a semantic frame, which is produced by merging initial frames.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We regard each output cluster as a verb class this time.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We presented a step-wise unsupervised method for inducing verb classes from instances in giga-word corpora.</a>
