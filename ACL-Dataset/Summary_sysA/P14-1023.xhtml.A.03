<a href="#0" id="0">The first block of the table reports the maximum per-task performance (across all considered parameter settings) for count and predict vectors.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The success of the predict models cannot be blamed on poor performance of the count models.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Besides the fact that this would not explain the near-state-of-the-art performance of the predict vectors, the count model results are actually quite good in absolute terms.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Interestingly, count vectors achieve performance comparable to that of predict vectors only on the selectional preference tasks.</a>
