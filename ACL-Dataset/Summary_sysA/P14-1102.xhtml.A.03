<a href="#1" id="1">The acquisition of semantic role labelling (SRL) by the BabySRL model [] bears many similarities to the current work and is, to our knowledge, the only comparable line of inquiry to the current one.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The primary function of BabySRL is to model the acquisition of semantic role labelling while making an idiosyncratic error which infants also make [] , the 1-1 role bias error ( John and Mary gorped interpreted as John gorped Mary.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Similar to the model presented in this paper, BabySRL is based on simple ordering features such as argument position relative to the verb and argument position relative to the other arguments.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Further, the model exhibits better comprehension of wh -relatives than that -relatives similar to children [].</a>
