<a href="#0" id="0">The recently available Stanford Sentiment Treebank [] renders manually annotated, real-valued sentiment scores for all phrases in parse trees.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This corpus provides us with the data to further understand the quantitative behavior of negators, as the effect of negators can now be studied with arguments of rich syntactic and semantic variety.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Figure 1 illustrates the effect of a common list of negators on sentiment as observed on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">1 1 The sentiment values have been linearly rescaled from the original range [0, 1] to [-0.5, 0.5]; in the figure a negative or positive value corresponds to a negative or a positive sentiment respectively; zero means neutral.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The non-uniform distribution in Figure 1 has showed certain correlations between the sentiment values of s ⁢ ( w n , w → ) and s ⁢ ( w → ) , and such information has been leveraged in the models discussed in Section 3.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We intend to devise a model that implements Equation 4.</a>
