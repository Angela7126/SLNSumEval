<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we aim to identify hypernym – hyponym relations using word embeddings, which have been shown to preserve good properties for capturing semantic relationship between words.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We obtain 15,247 word pairs of hypernym – hyponym relations (9,288 for direct relations and 5,959 for indirect relations.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We extract hypernym – hyponym relations in the Baidubaike corpus, which is also used to train word embeddings (Section 4.1.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our method based on word embeddings can discover more hypernym – hyponym relations than the previous methods can.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Using the word embeddings, we learn the hypernym – hyponym relationship by estimating projection matrices which map words to their hypernyms.</a>
