<a href="#0" id="0">We evaluated the proposed RNN-based alignment models against two baselines the IBM Model 4 and the FFNN-based model with one hidden layer.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The IBM Model 4 was trained by previously presented model sequence schemes [ 28 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Table 4 shows the alignment performance on B ⁢ T ⁢ E ⁢ C with various training data sizes, i.e.,, training data for I ⁢ W ⁢ S ⁢ L ⁢ T (40 K), training data for B ⁢ T ⁢ E ⁢ C (9 K), and the randomly sampled 1 K data from the B ⁢ T ⁢ E ⁢ C training data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Note that R ⁢ N ⁢ N s + c ⁢ ( R ) cannot be trained from the 40 K data because the 40 K data does not have gold standard word alignments.</a>
