<a href="#0" id="0">From an information-theoretic point of view [ 38 ] , various problems in text analytics can be formulated as estimating the probability mass/density functions of tokens in text.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In NLP, many of the probabilistic text models work in the discrete space [ 9 , 2 ] , but our model is different since the text features are sparse, we first perform kernel density estimates to smooth out the zeroing items, and then calculate the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variables.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Note that the above step is also known as probability integral transform [ 11 ] , which allows us to convert any given continuous distribution to random variables having a uniform distribution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">This is of crucial importance to modeling text data instead of using the classic bag-of-words representation that uses raw counts, we are now working with uniform marginal CDFs, which helps coping with the overfitting issue due to noise and data sparsity.</a>
