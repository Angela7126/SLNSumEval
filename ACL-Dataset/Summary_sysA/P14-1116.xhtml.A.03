<a href="#0" id="0">We frame content selection as a simple classification task given a set of time-series data, decide for each template whether it should be included in a summary or not.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Collective content selection [] is similar to our proposed method in that it is a classification task that predicts the templates from the same instance simultaneously.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Algorithm adaptation approaches [] extend simple classification methods to handle ML data.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The RAndom k-labELsets (RAkEL) [] was applied in order to perform ML classification.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The summaries generated by the ML classification system are then compared with the output of a RL system and two baseline systems in simulation and with real students.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">We have shown that ML classification for summarisation of our time-series data has an accuracy of 76.95% and that this approach significantly outperforms other classification methods as it is able to capture dependencies in the data when making content selection decisions.</a>
