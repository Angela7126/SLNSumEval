<a href="#0" id="0">With the help of Amazon Mechanical Turk 1 1 www.mturk.com , we crowdsourced annotations on a corpus of edit-turn-pairs from 26 random English Wikipedia articles in various thematic categories.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The search space for corresponding edit-turn-pairs is quite big, as any edit to an article may correspond to any turn from the article â€™ s discussion page.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Assuming that most edit-turn-pairs are non-corresponding, we expect a heavy imbalance in the class distribution.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It was important to find a reasonable amount of corresponding edit-turn-pairs before the actual annotation could take place, as we needed a certain amount of positive seeds to keep turkers from simply labeling pairs as non-corresponding all the time.</a>
