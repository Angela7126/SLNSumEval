<a href="#0" id="0">Figure 1 shows an overview of the approach we first parse densely with a coarse grammar and then parse sparsely with the fine grammar, skipping symbols that the coarse pass deemed sufficiently unlikely.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Another approach would be to skip enqueuing any parse item ( s , i , k , j ) where the pruning mask for any of ( i , j ) , ( i , k ) , or ( k , j ) is entirely empty (i.e., all symbols are pruned in this cell by the coarse grammar.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The result is a parsing speed of 185.5 sentences per second, as shown in Table 1 on the row labeled ‘ Reimpl ’ with ‘ Empty, Coarse ’ pruning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">At the top level, our system first computes pruning masks with a coarse grammar.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We tested our new pruning approach using an X-bar grammar as the coarse pass.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Now, when we use a coarse pruning pass, we are able to parse nearly 280 sentences per second, a 70% increase in parsing performance relative to Canny et al.</a>
