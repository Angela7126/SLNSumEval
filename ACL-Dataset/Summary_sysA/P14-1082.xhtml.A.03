<a href="#0" id="0">The classifier maps the L1 word or phrase in its L2 context to its L2 translation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For any given hypothesis H , results from the L1 to L2 classifier are combined with results from the L2 language model.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">A second baseline was constructed by weighing the probabilities from the translation table directly with the L2 language model described earlier.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this study we have shown the feasibility of a classifier-based translation assistance system in which L1 fragments are translated in an L2 context, in which the classifier experts are built individually per word or phrase.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We have shown that such a translation assistance system scores both above a context-insensitive baseline, as well as an L2 language model baseline.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Automated configuration selection had positive results, yet the system with context size one and an L2 language model component often produces the best results.</a>
