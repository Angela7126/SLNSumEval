<a href="#0" id="0">In order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To model the tag dependency, previous neural network models [ 6 , 35 ] introduce a transition score A i ⁢ j for jumping from tag i ∈ T to tag j ∈ T.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Where f Θ ( t i c [ i - 2 i + 2 ] , t i - 1 ) is the score output for tag t i at the i -th character by the network with parameters Θ.</a>
