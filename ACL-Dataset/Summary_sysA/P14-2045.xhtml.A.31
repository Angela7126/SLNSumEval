<a href="#0" id="0">Our results confirm that showing examples in the form of words or phrases significantly improves the accuracy with which grammatical relationships are recognized over the standard baseline of showing the relation name with blanks.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our findings also showed that clausal relationships, which span longer distances in sentences, benefited significantly more from example phrases than either of the other treatments.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The results imply that user interfaces for syntactic search should show candidate relationships augmented with a list of phrases in which they occur.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">A list of phrases is the most recognizable presentation for clausal relationships (34% better than the baseline), and is as good as a list of words for the other types of relations, except adverb modifiers.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">For adverb modifiers, the list of words is the most recognizable presentation.</a>
