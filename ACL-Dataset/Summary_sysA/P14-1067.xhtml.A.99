<a href="#0" id="0">Among these, the necessity to model the diversity of human quality judgements and correction strategies [ 16 , 15 ] calls for solutions that i) account for annotator-specific behaviour, thus being capable of learning from inherently noisy datasets produced by multiple annotators, and ii) self-adapt to changes in data distribution, learning from user feedback on new, unseen test items.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">This suggests that, although PA is potentially capable of achieving higher results and better adapt to the new test points, its instability makes it less reliable for practical use.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a final analysis of our results, we investigated how the performance of the different types of models ( batch , adaptive , empty ) relates to the distance between training and test sets.</a>
