<a href="#1" id="1">Run sentiment classification on the un-annotated data D u with the current sentiment model and generate probabilities of sentiment classes for each tweet, P ( c x i ) ;.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Train a topic model on D , and store the topic inference model and topic distributions of each tweet;.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Cluster data in D based on the topic distributions from Step 5 and train a separate sentiment model for each cluster.</a>
