<a href="#0" id="0">These topic-related documents are utilized to learn a specific topic representation for each sentence using a neural network based approach.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this section, we explain our neural network based topic similarity model in detail, as well as how to incorporate the topic similarity features into SMT decoding procedure.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The learned neural networks are used to obtain sentence topic representations, which will be further leveraged to infer topic representations of bilingual translation rules.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We evaluate the performance of our neural network based topic similarity model on a Chinese-to-English machine translation task.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">This proves that bilingually induced topic representation with neural network helps the SMT system disambiguate translation candidates.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In our work, a novel neural network based approach is proposed to infer topic representations for parallel data.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In this paper, we propose a neural network based approach to learning bilingual topic representation for SMT.</a>
