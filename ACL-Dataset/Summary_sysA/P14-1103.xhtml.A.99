<a href="#0" id="0">The set of constraints learned by the model satisfy two major goals they explain the data as well as the standard phonological analysis, and their violation structures correspond to the standard constraints.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">2.4 , we assume that F is known as part of the output of Gen [].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The goal of the IBPOT model is to learn the markedness matrix M and weights w for both the markedness and faithfulness constraints.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">As for M , we need a non-parametric prior, as there is no inherent limit to the number of markedness constraints a language will use.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The violations on a given output form only affect probabilities within its paradigm.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">As a result, learned constraints are consistent within paradigms, but across paradigms, the same constraint may serve different purposes.</a>
