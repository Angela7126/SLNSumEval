<a href="#0" id="0">Example ( 1 ), where ⟨⟩ marks the cue and { } the in-scope elements, illustrates the annotations, including how negation inside a noun phrase can scope over discontinuous parts of the sentence.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Thus, the MRS crawling operations ‘ paint ’ a subset of the MRS graph as in-scope for a given negation cue.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Our MRS crawling algorithm was defined by looking at the annotated data rather than the annotation guidelines for the Shared Task [ 7 ].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Since in this case, the negation cue will not be a quantifier in the MRS, there will be no functor crawling to the verb ’ s EP.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We evaluated the performance of our system using the Shared Task development and evaluation data (respectively CDD and CDE in Table 1.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Furthermore, even a system using syntactic structure to model scope would be faced with a more complicated task than our crawling rules.</a>
