<a href="#0" id="0">By concentrating on citation polarity we are able to compare our classification to previous citation polarity work.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We treat citation polarity classification as a sentiment analysis domain adaptation task and therefore must be careful not to define features that are too domain specific.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We are interested in domain adaptation for citation classification and therefore need a target dataset of citations and a non-citation source dataset.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In our second set of experiments, we follow the domain adaptation approaches described in [ 12 ] and train on product review and citation data before testing on citations.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our initial results show that using mSDA for domain adaptation to citations actually outperforms in-domain classification.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Our approach achieves similar macro- F 1 on only the citation sentence, but using a different corpus we have shown that you can improve citation polarity classification by leveraging large amounts of annotated data from other domains and using a simple set of features.</a>
