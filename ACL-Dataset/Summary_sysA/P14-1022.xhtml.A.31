<a href="#0" id="0">Recall that our CRF factors over anchored rules r , where each r has identity rule ⁢ ( r ) and anchoring span ⁢ ( r.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The X-bar grammar has only indicators of rule ⁢ ( r ) , ignoring the anchoring.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Let a surface property of r be an indicator function of span ⁢ ( r ) and the sentence itself.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">For example, the first word in a constituent is a surface property, as is the word directly preceding the constituent.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">As illustrated in Figure 1 , the actual features of the model are obtained by conjoining surface properties with various abstractions of the rule identity.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">For rule abstractions, we use two templates the parent of the rule and the identity of the rule.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">The surface features are somewhat more involved, and so we introduce them incrementally.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">We have built up a strong set of features by this point, but have not yet answered the question of whether or not grammar annotation is useful on top of them.</a>
<a href="#8" id="8">In this section, we examine two of the most commonly used types of additional annotation, structural annotation, and lexical annotation.</a>
