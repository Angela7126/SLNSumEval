<a href="#0" id="0">If a word undergoes sense change, this can be detected by comparing the sense clusters obtained from two different time periods by the algorithm outlined above.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">1 ≤ k ≤ m , 1 ≤ l ≤ n denotes the fraction of words in a newer sense cluster s j ⁢ l , that were also present in an older sense cluster s i ⁢ k.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">K = m + 1 , 1 ≤ l ≤ n denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s j ⁢ l , that were not present in any of the m clusters in t ⁢ v i.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">1 ≤ k ≤ m , l = n + 1 denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s i ⁢ k , that did not show up in any of the n clusters in t ⁢ v j.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Thus, the matrix I captures all the four possible scenarios for sense change.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Since we can not expect a perfect split, birth etc., we used certain threshold values to detect if a candidate word is undergoing sense change via one of these four cases.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In Figure 1 , as an example, we illustrate the birth of a new sense for the word ‘ compiler ’.</a>
