<a href="#0" id="0">To show that our future scenario generation methods can generate many acceptable scenarios with reasonable precision, we experimentally compared four methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Proposed , our scenario generation method without the two filters, Proposed+Orig , our method with the original sentence filter, Proposed+Orig+Comm , our method with the original sentence and common argument filters, and Exact , a method that chains event causality by exact matching.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We applied our event causality extraction method to 2,451,254 candidates (Section 3.1 ) and culled the top 1,200,000 phrase pairs from them (See Section LABEL:A-sec:examples-of-event-causality in the supplementary notes for examples.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We proposed a supervised method for event causality extraction that exploits semantic relation, context, and association features.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We also proposed methods for our new task, future scenario generation.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The methods chain event causality by causal-compatibility.</a>
