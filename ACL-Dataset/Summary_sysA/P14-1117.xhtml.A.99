<a href="#0" id="0">Maximum spanning tree algorithms, commonly used in non-projective dependency parsing [ 35 ] , are not easily adaptable to this task since the maximum-weight subtree is not necessarily a part of the maximum spanning tree.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">An approximate inference approach based on an LP relaxation of ILP-Dep.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As discussed in § 2.4 , a maximum spanning tree is recovered from the output of the LP and greedily pruned in order to generate a valid integral solution while observing the imposed compression rate.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Comparing the two approximation strategies shows a clear performance advantage for DP+LP over DP+LP → MST the latter approach entails slower inference due to the overhead of running the Chu-Liu Edmonds algorithm at every dual update, and furthermore, the error introduced by approximating an integral solution results in a significant decrease in dependency recall.</a>
