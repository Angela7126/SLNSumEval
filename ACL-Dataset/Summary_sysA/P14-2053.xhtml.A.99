<a href="#0" id="0">The vast majority of systems generate questions by selecting one sentence at a time, extracting portions of the source sentence, then applying transformation rules or patterns in order to construct a question.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Additionally, patterns indicate the semantic arguments that provide the answer to the question, required fields, and filter condition fields.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As these patterns are matched, they will be rejected as candidates for generation for a particular sentence if the required arguments are absent or if filter conditions are present.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The patterns are designed to match only the arguments used as part of the question or the answer, in order to prevent over generation of questions.</a>
