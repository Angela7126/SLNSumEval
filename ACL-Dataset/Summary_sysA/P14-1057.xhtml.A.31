<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, to address the limitation caused by the inaccurate concept mapping results, we propose to regularize the weighting strategies in the concept-based representation methods.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Specifically, by applying the axiomatic approaches [ 7 ] , we analyze the retrieval functions with concept-based representation and find that they may violate some reasonable retrieval constraints.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Medical record retrieval is an important domain-specific IR problem.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Concept-based representation is an effective approach to dealing with ambiguity terminology in medical domain.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">However, the results of the NLP tools used to generate the concept-based representation are often not perfect.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">In this paper, we present a general methodology that can use axiomatic approaches as guidance to regularize the concept weighting strategies to address the limitations caused by the inaccurate concept mapping and improve the retrieval performance.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">In particular, we proposed two weighting regularization methods based on the relations among concepts.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Experimental results show that the proposed methods can significantly outperform existing retrieval functions.</a>
