<a href="#0" id="0">In this paper, we propose a sentence-level sentiment classification method that can (1) incorporate rich discourse information at both local and global levels; (2) encode discourse knowledge as soft constraints during learning; (3) make use of unlabeled data to enhance learning.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Specifically, we use the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model as the learner for sentence-level sentiment classification, and incorporate rich discourse and lexical knowledge as soft constraints into the learning of CRF parameters via Posterior Regularization (PR) [ 7 ].</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a framework for structured learning with constraints, PR has been successfully applied to many structural NLP tasks [ 6 , 7 , 5 ].</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">When combining discourse constraints with features from different sentences, the PR model becomes more powerful in disambiguating sentiment.</a>
