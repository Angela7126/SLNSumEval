<a href="#0" id="0">For our semi-supervised DAE feature learning task, we use the unsupervised pre-trained DBN to initialize DAE ’ s parameters and use the input original phrase features as the “ teacher ” for semi-supervised back-propagation.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Our semi-supervised DAE features significantly outperform the unsupervised DBN features and the baseline features, and our introduced input phrase features significantly improve the performance of DAE feature learning.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Next, we adapt and extend some original phrase features as the input features for DAE feature learning.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Except for the phrase feature X 1 [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , our introduced input features X significantly improve the DAE feature learning (row 11 vs.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Secondly, compared with the baseline phrase features X 1 , our introduced input original phrase features X significantly improve the performance of not only our DAE features but also the DBN features.</a>
