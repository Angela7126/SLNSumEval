<a href="#0" id="0">Experimental results over two TREC collections show that both proposed concept-based weighting regularization methods can improve the retrieval performance, and their performance is comparable with the best systems of the TREC Medical Records tracks [ 25 , 24 ].</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For example, as shown in Figure 1 , query aspect ‚Äú children ‚Äù is mapped to 2 concepts while ‚Äú dental caries ‚Äù is mapped to 3 concepts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In particular, we first formalize retrieval constraints that any reasonable concept-based representation methods should satisfy and then discuss how to regularize the existing weighting strategies to satisfy the constraints and improve the retrieval performance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">S ‚Å¢ ( Q , D ) is the relevance score of D with respect to Q e i denotes a concept, and ùíú‚Å¢ ( e ) denotes the query aspect associated with e , i.e.,, a set of concepts that are mapped to the same phrases as e by using MetaMap i ‚Å¢ ( e ) is the normalized confidence score of the mapping for concept e generated by MetaMap c ‚Å¢ ( e , D ) denotes the occurrences of concept e in document D , d ‚Å¢ f ‚Å¢ ( e ) denotes the number of documents containing e.</a>
