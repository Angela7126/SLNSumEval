<a href="#0" id="0">However, we further observe that hypernym – hyponym relations are more complicated than a single offset can represent.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">To address this challenge, we propose a more sophisticated and general method — learning a linear projection which maps words to their hypernyms (Section 3.3.1.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym – hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Subsequently, we identify whether an unknown word pair is a hypernym – hyponym relation using the projections (Section 3.4.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply word embeddings to this task.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The training data for projection learning is collected from CilinE (Section 3.3.3.</a>
