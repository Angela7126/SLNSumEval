<a href="#1" id="1">We discard pairs of words for which the forms across languages are identical (i.e.,, the Romanian word matrice and its Italian cognate pair matrice , having the same form), because these pairs do not provide any orthographic changes to be learned.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">We propose a method for automatic detection of cognate pairs using orthographic alignment.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We investigate the performance of the method we propose in comparison to previous approaches for automatic detection of cognate pairs based on orthographic similarity.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In this paper we proposed a method for automatic detection of cognates based on orthographic alignment.</a>
