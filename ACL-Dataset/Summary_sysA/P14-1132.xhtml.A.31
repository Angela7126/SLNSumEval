<a href="#0" id="0">The process of learning to map objects to the their word label is implemented by training a projection function f proj v → w from the visual onto the linguistic semantic space.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">For the learning, we use a set of N s seen concepts for which we have both image-based visual representations 𝐕 s ∈ℝ N s × d v and text-based linguistic representations 𝐖 s ∈ℝ N s × d w.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The projection function is subject to an objective that aims at minimizing some cost function between the induced text-based representations 𝐖 ^ s ∈ℝ N s × d w and the gold ones 𝐖 s.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The induced f proj v → w is then applied to the image-based representations 𝐕 u ∈ℝ N u × d v of N u unseen objects to transform them into text-based representations 𝐖 ^ u ∈ℝ N u × d w.</a>
