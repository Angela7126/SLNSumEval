<a href="#0" id="0">Because the number of alternatives is small, the scoring function could in principle involve arbitrary (global) features of parse trees.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">When proposing a small move, i.e.,, sampling a head of the word, we can also jointly sample its POS tag from a set of alternatives provided by the tagger.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As a result, the selected tag is influenced by a broad syntactic context above and beyond the initial tagging model and is directly optimized to improve parsing performance.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">However, for the joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset we do not use the Random Walk method because the first-order features in normal parsing are no longer first-order when POS tags are also variables.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The Effect of Constraints in Learning Our training method updates parameters to satisfy the pairwise constraints between (1) subsequent samples on the sampling path and (2) selected samples and the ground truth.</a>
