<a href="#1" id="1">2 2 http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T03 Our corpus is roughly similar in size to the PKPB, and taken together, the two Korean corpora now total about half the size of the Penn English PropBank.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Table 1 shows the semantic roles considered in our annotated corpus.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">We have annotated semantic roles by following the PropBank annotation guideline [ 3 ] and by using frame files of the Penn Korean PropBank built by Palmer et al.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">We ran Kokoma Korean morpheme analyzer 4 4 http://kkma.snu.ac.kr/ on each sentence of the Donga corpus to divide words into morphemes to build latent morpheme representations.</a>
