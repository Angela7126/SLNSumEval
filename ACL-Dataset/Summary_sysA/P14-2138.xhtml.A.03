<a href="#0" id="0">We design an algorithm to identify the most discriminative words and the character bigrams that are indicative of such words, and perform two experiments to quantify their impact on the NLI task.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">We are interested in identifying the character bigrams that are indicative of the most discriminative words in order to quantify their impact on the bigram-based classifier.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Algorithm 2 summarizes our method of identifying the discriminative words and indicative character bigrams.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In the first experiment, we showed that the removal of the 100 most discriminative words from the training data results in a significant drop in the accuracy of the classifier that is based exclusively on character bigrams.</a>
