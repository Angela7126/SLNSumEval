<a href="#0" id="0">We apply image dispersion-based filtering as follows if both concepts in an evaluation pair have an image dispersion below a given threshold, both the linguistic and the visual representations are included.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">The filtering approach described thus far improves multi-modal representations because image dispersion provides a means to distinguish concrete concepts from more abstract concepts.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">To evaluate the effectiveness of image dispersion as a proxy for concreteness we evaluated our algorithm on a binary classification task based on the set of 100 concrete and 100 abstract concepts A âˆª C introduced in Section 2.</a>
