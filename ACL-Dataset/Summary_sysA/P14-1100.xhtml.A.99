<a href="#0" id="0">Given the fact that the distance between a pair of nodes is a function of the random variables they represent (according to the true model), only 𝑫 W ⁢ W can be empirically estimated from data.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">However, if the underlying tree structure is known, then Definition 1 can be leveraged to compute 𝑫 Z ⁢ Z and 𝑫 Z ⁢ W as we show below.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Where Ν𝒙⁢ ( Γ ) , defined in the supplementary, is a function of the underlying distribution over the tag sequences 𝒙 and the kernel bandwidth Γ.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Thus, the sample complexity of our approach depends on the dimensionality of the latent and observed states ( m and p ), the underlying singular values of the cross-covariance matrices ( Σ∗⁢ ( 𝒙 ) ) and the difference in the cost of the true tree compared to the cost of the incorrect trees ( △⁢ ( 𝒙 ).</a>
