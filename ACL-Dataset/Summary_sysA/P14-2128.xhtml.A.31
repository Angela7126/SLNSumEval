<a href="#0" id="0">Our first experiment is to investigate the effect of processing paired punctuations on parsing accuracy.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this experiment, the method introduced in Section 3.1 is used to process paired punctuations, and the non-paired punctuations are left un-touched.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Feature templates used in this experiment are those listed in the top three rows of Table 3 together with those used for the baseline arc-standard parser.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">In this work, we proposed to treat punctuations as properties of context words for dependency parsing.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Experiments with an arc-standard parser showed that our method effectively improves parsing performance and we achieved the best accuracy for single-model transition-based parser.</a>
