<a href="#1" id="1">In contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">In order to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation ’ s arguments, we derive two kinds of clues from an existing KB, which are further utilized to discover the disagreements among local candidate predictions.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It is worth mentioning that when sufficient learnt clues are added into the model, the results are comparable to those based on the clues refined manually, as shown in Figure 5.</a>
