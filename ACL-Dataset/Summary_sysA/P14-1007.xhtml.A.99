<a href="#0" id="0">Task 1 at the First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics ( * SEM 2012; \citeNP Mor:Bla:12) provided a fresh, principled annotation of negation and called for systems to analyze negation — detecting cues (affixes, words, or phrases that express negation), resolving their scopes (which parts of a sentence are actually negated), and identifying the negated event or property.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">As with the logical-forms representations we use, the DRS logical forms do not include function words as predicates in the semantics.</a>
