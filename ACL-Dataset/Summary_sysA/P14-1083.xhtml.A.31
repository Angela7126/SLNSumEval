<a href="#0" id="0">The proposed approach of response-based learning opens the doors for various extrinsic tasks in which SMT systems can be trained and evaluated.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept experiment that uses feedback from a simulated world environment.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Building on prior work in grounded semantic parsing, we generate translations of queries, and receive feedback by executing semantic parses of translated queries against the database.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Successful response is defined as receiving the same answer from the semantic parses for the translation and the original query.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Our experimental results show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for response-based learning over standard structured learning from reference translations.</a>
