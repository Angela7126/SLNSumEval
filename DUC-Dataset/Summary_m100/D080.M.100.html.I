  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The California case began in 1983
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   and became a frenetic, media-fed, witch-hunt.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Reactions to the verdict included tears, no surprise, disappointment, anger, excuses, and finger pointing.
  </a>

  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   but the prosecution failed to prove the defendants responsible.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Other parties defended their own roles,
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   but blamed others or the system.
