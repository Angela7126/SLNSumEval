  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border crossing on the west side of the Berlin Wall, was lifted into the sky by a giant crane on June 21, 1990, placed gently onto a flatbed truck and consigned to history.

   Checkpoint Charlie stood just 20 yards from a East German checkpoint and was the only place between the Berlins that could be crossed on foot by non-Germans.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and their colleagues from France, Britain and the two Germanys were to preside over a ceremony marking the checkpoint's removal on June 14, 1990.
