   Federal emergency officials have estimated that the next ``big one'' _ a quake like the 1906 San Francisco quake _ could kill 3,000 to 14,000 people in southern California, and 3,000 to 11,000 people in the Bay Area.

   Although Tuesday's quake was powerful, Waverly Person, chief of the National Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., cautioned that at 6.9 magnitude, it should be considered only a "strong" shock, not a "major" one, as a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a "great" one, as a quake of 8.0 or above would be.
