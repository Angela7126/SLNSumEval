   At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin its three-year release of "The Bernstein Collection": "We will release 75 CDs of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD". Kurt Ollmann, familiar from Bernstein's 1985 "West Side Story" recording, sang "Take Care of This House" from Bernstein's last (1976), unsuccessful, Broadway show, "1600 Pennsylvania Ave" .
