   There are events one never forgets. And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget . My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I knew what was happening . To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, mainly because I was awake this time . The stadium was shaking and the special concrete joint -- one of several strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage -- was doing was it was designed to do .
