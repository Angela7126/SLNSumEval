   Hurricane Andrew yesterday smashed
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   its way through Louisiana causing heavy damage in rural communities
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">

  <a href="#4" id="4">
   After hitting Louisiana with winds up to 120 miles per hour,

  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Andrew lost force
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   and by yesterday afternoon was down-graded to a tropical storm.

  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Across Florida 2 million people were without electricity yesterday.

  <a href="#9" id="9">
   There was more than $15 billion property damage in Florida,

  <a href="#10" id="10">
   but most of it was to uninsured property,
  </a>
