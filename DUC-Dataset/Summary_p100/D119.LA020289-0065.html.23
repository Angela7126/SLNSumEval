   President Bush, filling a key overseas post, has decided to nominate a former CIA officer as ambassador to China, sources said Wednesday. The choice is James R. Lilley, a career intelligence officer who served as CIA station chief in China when Bush headed the U.S. liaison office there in 1974-75 . Word of the expected nomination came as Bush's choice to be assistant secretary of state for Latin America, Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, ran into objections from several Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, congressional aides said .
