   Biographer Edward Behr released information Wednesday about his BBC documentary on Hirohito.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   President Truman, the show claims,
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   decided not to prosecute Hirohito for war crimes,
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   and Japan's wartime prime minister, Gen. Tojo, was pressured into changing his testimony so the emperor would not be incriminated.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   The show also challenges the theory
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   that Hirohito was forced to accept his generals' plans,
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   alleging that he knew about the 1937 massacre of over 20,000 Chinese at Nanking
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   and had advance knowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   BBC will show the documentary on Jan 24.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   It will air in the United States in March.
