   His [Chancellor Helmut Kohl] meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev convinced him, he told West German radio, that the two German states should "enter into negotiations as quickly as possible" after the March 18 East German election. Kohl will meet with East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow on Tuesday and Wednesday in Bonn to discuss immediate steps in economic cooperation, including monetary union, to prevent the collapse of the faltering East German economy . Kohl said that his talks with Gorbachev -- who told him that reunification is a matter for the Germans themselves to decide -- could lead to an "economic breakthrough" in East Germany, which in turn could provide a "push forward" for all of Europe .
