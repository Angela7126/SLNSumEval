  <a href="#2" id="2">
   President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq and froze the nation's assets in the United States on Aug. 1, 1990 while refusing to rule out the use of U.S. troops to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders. At a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is scheduled to give a speech to the nonprofit Aspen Institute on July 28, 1990, Bush said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III will discuss the Persian Gulf situation with Soviet officials in Moscow on Aug. 3, 1990 .
