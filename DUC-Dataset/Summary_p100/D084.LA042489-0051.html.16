   There were 11 survivors inside the turret, all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ship's magazines, the Navy said. Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two other turrets . The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber "bloomers" that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse .
