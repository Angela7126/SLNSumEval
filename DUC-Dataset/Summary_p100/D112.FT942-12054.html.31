   Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.

   The writs also allege that on May 28 1991 - the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for - Goldman was due to receive Dollars 58.2m for an unrelated transaction selling MCC stock to an unnamed American lawyer 'with close connections to Robert Maxwell'.

   The writs say that Goldman and Sheinberg 'made no reasonable effort to determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the shares be sold and where the more than Dollars 47m in proceeds from the transfer of the 12.5m shares should go'.
