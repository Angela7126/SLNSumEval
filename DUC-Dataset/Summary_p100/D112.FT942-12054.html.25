   WRIT IN MANHATTAN
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   On May 23 Maxwell told Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Goldman knew or should have known was controlled by the Maxwell family.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   On April 26 1991, they say, Mr Kevin Maxwell told Mr Sheinberg to sell the pension scheme shares to the Swiss trusts.
