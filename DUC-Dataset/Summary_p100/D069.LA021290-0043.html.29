   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared on his return from Moscow on Sunday that "the way is now free" for German reunification. His meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev convinced him, he told West German radio, that the two German states should "enter into negotiations as quickly as possible" after the March 18 East German election . He said that immediate steps must be taken on the economic front to "stop the hemorrhage of East Germans to the Federal Republic and keep them in their heimat," or home, in East Germany .
