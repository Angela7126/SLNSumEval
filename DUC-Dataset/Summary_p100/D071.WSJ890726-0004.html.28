   Such is the life of one German short-haired pointer, a show dog bearing the name CH.

   One of the dog's three owners thinks the kennel-club world has seen enough of Cory, who is four years old.

   In what is fast becoming a pit-bull match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, John and Rita Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially retired (as announced in Dog News).
