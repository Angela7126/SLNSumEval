   Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two other turrets. The scarred battleship Iowa made a somber return on Apr. 22, 1989 to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors . Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said on Apr. 22, 1989 that he believes the four battleships still "have merit" as weapons in the U.S. arsenal and have a future in the modern Navy .
