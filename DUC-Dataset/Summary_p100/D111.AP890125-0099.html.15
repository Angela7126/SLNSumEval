   Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called "Lucona" scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee.

   Blecha and Gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding Udo Proksch, the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship Lucona in the Indian Ocean.
