   Bounding up a hill in his thin green Windbreaker, with sand from the beach blowing into his face, Mr. Kelley shouts over the howling gale: "This isn't too bad, you know," he says, though the wind chill factor is about 20 below. And even at the age of 83, he probably will finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runners expected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on April 15 .
