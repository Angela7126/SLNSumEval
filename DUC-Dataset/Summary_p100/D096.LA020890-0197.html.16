   The Los Angeles Sports Council, in a bid to bring Super Bowl XXVII to the Rose Bowl in 1993, will offer the stadium to the National Football League rent-free in a proposal next Monday. "The bulk of the revenue would go to the Rose Bowl, but the idea is that we would share with the Coliseum and Anaheim," Aghjayan said . Pasadena earned $300,000 from the 1983 Super Bowl and $800,000 in 1987, the money coming from stadium rental fees, concession sales, admission taxes, charges for use of a hospitality tent compound and parking fees .
