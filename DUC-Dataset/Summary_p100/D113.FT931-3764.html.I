   More than a dozen bombs exploded yesterday afternoon in Bombay,
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   killing about 200
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   and injuring more than a 1,000.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The devices, mostly car bombs,
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   appeared to be a systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Targets included the Bombay Stock Exchange, Air India building, a shopping complex, and two hotels near the airport.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   The identity of the bombers is unknown,
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   but the goal appears to be renewing communal strife
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   and undermining government efforts
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   to attract foreign investment and tourism.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   Leaders have called for calm.
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   All roads into Bombay are blocked
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   and the army is on alert.
