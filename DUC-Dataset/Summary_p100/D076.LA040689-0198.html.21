   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today argued passionately during a four-hour meeting that covered subjects ranging from disarmament to reports of Soviet bomber sales to Libya, officials said. Reopening a European peace offensive that was disrupted by the Armenian earthquake, Gorbachev had "extremely frank exchanges, animated, warm, passionate and solemn," said a Thatcher spokesman, requesting anonymity . Gorbachev also hit the streets of London, stopping his motorcade to shake hands with about 20 people in a crowd of several hundred who cheered him outside Westminster Abbey . The Thatcher spokesman said the Soviet leader and the staunchly anti-Communist prime minister "love arguing" .
