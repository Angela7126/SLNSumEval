   Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched television event of the week, viewed by a whopping 63% of TV viewers, but not even Joe Montana could lift CBS out of the cellar in the ratings race, it was reported today. On the upside for CBS -- Super Bowl XXIV carried enough of its audience over to the debut of the new series, "Grand Slam," to provide a good audience sampling and give the action show a ranking of 15th for the night . Technically, Super Bowl IV in 1970 out-rated Super Bowl XXIV, 39.4 to 39.0 .
