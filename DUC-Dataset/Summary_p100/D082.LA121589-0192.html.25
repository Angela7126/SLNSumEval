  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Gorbachev, who freed the physicist from seven years of internal exile, called Sakharov a "man of conviction and sincerity". World leaders from President Bush to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 15, 1989 praised Andrei D. Sakharov as a tremendous force for freedom who outlived his Soviet persecutors and saw the liberty he championed take root throughout Eastern Europe . Lech Walesa, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said Sakharov's death was "a great loss for reform both in the Soviet Union and everywhere else" .
