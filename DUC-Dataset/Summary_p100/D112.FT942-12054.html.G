   filed two writs last week in Manhattan for Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Scheme and Maxwell Communications Corporation Works Pension Scheme.

  <a href="#4" id="4">
   that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank,
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   assisted in diverting currency from the two Robert Maxwell-controlled pension schemes
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interest

  <a href="#7" id="7">
   would be repaid.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   The writs center on the purchase of #55 million of MCC shares from the pension schemes of the two Swiss trusts
  </a>

   which were transacted through Goldman.
