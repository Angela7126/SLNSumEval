   The Senate panel weighing John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in Tower's descriptions of his business dealings with a British aircraft and weapons manufacturer, congressional sources said Friday Tower testified last week that he had represented British Aerospace Inc. only on civil aviation matters, not as a consultant on military systems In a divorce deposition, taken in June, 1987, Tower stated that he had given the company advice on "selling certain systems to the Defense Department" In the deposition, Tower said he represented the firm on a range of military programs and was paid $8,000 a month.
