  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   More than 10,000 coal miners in four states were off the job on June 16, 1989 to express sympathy for miners in Virginia and West Virginia who have waged a bitter strike since April against the Pittston Coal Group.

   One United Mine Workers representative said on June 16, 1989 that the Indiana walkout was prompted by on June 14, 1989 night's telecast of CBS' "48 Hours," which focused on the Pittston strike, in which 1,600 miners have been off the job since April.
