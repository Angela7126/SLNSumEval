   Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Mr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United States.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into the law of the land.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   He's got plenty of experience, plenty of experience _ experience in raising taxes again and again, experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools, experience in increasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all Americans and the future of our country.
