   Orange County's Iranian community launched an ambitious effort Sunday to collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people in earthquake-ravaged Iran. Representatives of 11 Iranian professional and community groups manned tables near William R. Mason Regional Park, where contributors dropped off supplies, pledged other aid or made financial contributions . The 50 organizers Sunday wore black armbands expressing their grief for those killed, injured and left homeless in what they described as that country's worst earthquake of the century .
