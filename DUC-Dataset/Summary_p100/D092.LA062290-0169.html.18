   Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington. The aid would be accepted through the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian organizations, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said . The death toll was higher than a quake that killed 25,000 people in nearby Soviet Armenia in December, 1988, and a quake in Iran in 1978 that also killed 25,000 .
