   Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not had two shuttles on the launch pad since Columbia took off Jan. 12, 1986, with Challenger poised on a pad 1.7 miles away . Commander Loren J. Shriver, 45; co-pilot Charles F. Bolden, 43; Steven A. Hawley, 38; Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38, plan to launch the telescope Wednesday .
