   MR MICHAEL STONEY, a senior executive in a number of Maxwell companies, is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than Pounds 180m of 'unusual' payments from Mirror Group Newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year, according to the chairman's statement released with MGN accounts yesterday.

   In his report Sir Robert points to 'certain weaknesses' accepted by the MGN board: Internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval; Bank mandates authorised by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permitted the movement of group funds on the authority of Maxwell or directors who were also directors of Maxwell-controlled companies; The audit committee of non-executive directors, which might have reviewed systems and mandates, but was not convened; The finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury department's activities.
