   Charleston and San Francisco are united by suffering two of the century's costliest, back- to-back natural disasters, Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Both endured disruption of normal life, destroyed buildings, billions in damages, loss of life, and frustrating delays in getting federal assistance.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The two disasters were different
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   because Hugo gave Charleston warning.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Its damage was everywhere, over quickly, and immediately evident,
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   whereas earthquakes leave hidden damage and have aftershocks.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Charleston recovered slowly
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   and disrupted communications left it isolated.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   San Francisco's earthquake was reported immediately
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   and the city bounced back quickly.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   Charleston lost no major lifeline like the Bay Bridge.
