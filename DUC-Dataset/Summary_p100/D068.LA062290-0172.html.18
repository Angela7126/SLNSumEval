   As a brass band played and foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched, a crane lifted the prefabricated hut with its American, British and French flags and placed it on a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum. Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in the middle of the Friedrichstrasse boulevard after Communist East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of West Berlin . Hundreds of excited Berliners leaned from balconies and windows today to cheer Charlie's exit, snapping pictures and clapping in rhythm with the band as the crane pried the hut from its moorings and swung it away .
