   Iran said on June 22, 1990 that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington. Rescuers in Iran on June 22, 1990 freed thousands of people from buildings flattened by the earthquake in northern Iran, which struck early on June 20, 1990 and had a magnitude between 7.3 and 7.7 . The aid would be accepted through the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian organizations, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said .
