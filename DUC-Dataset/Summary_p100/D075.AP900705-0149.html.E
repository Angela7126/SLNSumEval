   According to a study published in the journal Science, cardiac cell damage following a heart attack may be limited by a natural substance called transforming growth factor beta.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   In studies with rats induced to have heart attacks, those rats receiving injections of TGF beta had 50 percent less cell damage than those not receiving the injections.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   TGF beta is normally present in heart cells but is missing from rat heart cells damaged by the simulated heart attack.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Hearts damaged by a heart attack tended to lose creatine kinase.
