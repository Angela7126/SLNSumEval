   A fiery explosion in a giant gun turret rocked the refitted battleship Iowa on maneuvers in the Atlantic on Apr. 19, 1989, killing at least 47 sailors and injuring an undetermined number, the Pentagon said. Another spokesman said at least 47 crewmen were killed in the explosion that ripped through the turret when one of the giant guns was being fired during a training exercise about 330 miles northeast of Puerto Rico .
