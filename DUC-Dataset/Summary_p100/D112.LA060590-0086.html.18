   British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell said Monday that he is involved in negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper valued "in the hundreds of millions of dollars". Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but his comments prompted industry speculation that it might be Gannett's USA Today, Tribune Co.'s New York Daily News or the Chicago Sun-Times . Maxwell's comments were made to reporters at the annual meeting in New York of Maxwell's Berlitz International and were confirmed later by a spokesman for Maxwell Communications, the investor's London-based holding company .
