   When the doors swung open Wednesday at the first McDonald's restaurant in the Soviet Union, thousands of Muscovites poured in to sip "milk cocktails" and taste their first "Beeg Mak Gamburgers," picking them apart to marvel at the fixin's. Although cynics might complain of the steady homogenizing of world cultures, the arrival of the fast-food chain here -- 14 years after a Canadian McDonald's official broached the idea with Soviet officials at the 1976 Montreal Olympics -- was without doubt a major event .

McDonald's officials say it is not a question that worries them or their Soviet counterparts .
