   Leopold Gratz, the president of Parliament and one of the most powerful politicians in the Socialist Party, resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship 12 years ago.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called ``Lucona'' scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The Lucona's cargo was officially described by Proksch as for a uranium processing plant and insured for $16 million.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The insurance company has never paid, claiming the cargo was only scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to collect the insurance money.
