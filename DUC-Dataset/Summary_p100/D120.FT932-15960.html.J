   Prime Minister John Major won the general election a year ago,
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   but today he is a deeply unpopular, unproven leader.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   His party is internally torn over the controversy
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   that accompanied Britain's withdrawal of sterling from the European Monetary System and by a lingering deep recession
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   that has alienated many traditional supporters in business.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Most industrialists are grateful
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   that he won the election
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   and he is appreciated for personal qualities
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   that are favorably compared to those of his predecessor.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">

  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   and no clearly articulated political conviction.
