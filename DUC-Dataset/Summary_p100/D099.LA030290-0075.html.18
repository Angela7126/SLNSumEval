   Try to think of Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon less as a "happening," which it surely is; or a world-class athletic event, which it may become but is not now. And that may yet transform this race, if -- as marathon President Bill Burke said this week -- the total purse of $202,520 is increased by $100,000 next year and significantly more money is added for appearance fees to lure top athletes . The race has Mercedes-Benz of North America as its presenting sponsor, making it one of 10 companies that have not only paid the race organizers to be called sponsors, but have also put more money into the race either outright or by providing products and services .
