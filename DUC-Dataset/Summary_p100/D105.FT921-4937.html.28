   A CEASEFIRE in Moldova was threatened yesterday when a truck driver transporting militiamen was shot dead by machinegun fire in the self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking minority.

   The shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the Moldovan authorities, dominated by ethnic Romanians, and the minority based in the republic on the east bank of the river Dnestr.

   From the beginning of the nationalist movement, it was clear that the Russian and, to a lesser extent, the Ukrainian minorities would be hostile, reacting to laws establishing Moldovan as the official language and to calls for renewed union with Romania with strikes and demonstrations, and, finally last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent under a Russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov.
