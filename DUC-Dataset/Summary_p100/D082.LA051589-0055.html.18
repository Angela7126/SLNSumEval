   Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said Sunday that his country is on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized system are too slow in arriving. While praising the new course in world affairs taken by the Soviet Union, as demonstrated by its withdrawal from Afghanistan, Sakharov told the congress of the Italian Socialist Party that some aspects of internal affairs are "deeply disturbing" . Sakharov, who did not mention the name of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, described as "anti-democratic" some measures taken to quell nationalist unrest, particularly the toxic gas believed to have been used against demonstrators in Soviet Georgia earlier this year .
