   The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake, San Jose, has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just east of San Jose, more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point.

   Scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the Calaveras fault may have been a precursor, or somehow added pressure, on the San Andreas.

   But when a 5.1 earthquake did strike on the Calaveras in 1988, some earthquake scientists expressed concern that this could be the case.
