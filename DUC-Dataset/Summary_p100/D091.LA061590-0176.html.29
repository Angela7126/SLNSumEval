   A flash flood sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high rampaging through hill communities along the Ohio River, killing at least 10 people and leaving dozens missing, authorities said today. Two creeks just outside this Ohio River village of 4,300 residents overflowed when thunderstorms dumped about 4 inches of rain Thursday night in about an hour . "The problem we're having right now is accounting for the people we can't find" . Williams said 40 to 60 people were unaccounted for at midday . Belmont County's sheriff's Sgt. Bart Giesey said 10 people were confirmed dead .
