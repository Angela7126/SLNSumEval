   I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit.

   Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was assassinated. And anyone who was at Candlestick Park on Oct. 16, 1989 night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget . To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, mainly because I was awake this time . My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I knew what was happening .
