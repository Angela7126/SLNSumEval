   The Los Angeles Sports Council, in a bid to bring Super Bowl XXVII to the Rose Bowl in 1993, will offer the stadium to the National Football League rent-free in a proposal next Monday. The Sports Council, which represents the Los Angeles-Orange County area in trying to bring major sports attractions here, also will offer the NFL all income from concessions and the sale of novelty items . The Rose Bowl, meanwhile, has proposed an $8.3-million project to renovate the press box and restructure about 1,000 seats for club seating, with an adjacent lounge, restaurant, hall of fame museum and gift shop .
