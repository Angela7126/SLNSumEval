   The decision to evacuate one of the largest overseas U.S. military bases was made early today after searing gases, ash and rock shot out of 4,795-foot Mount Pinatubo on Sunday at speeds of up to 60 mph. Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said Mount Pinatubo was in the "early eruptive stage" and "after that we will have bigger ones."; He said most of the ash and molten rocks had been flowing westward away from Clark.
