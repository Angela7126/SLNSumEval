   The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable.

   One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked: 'James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is'.
