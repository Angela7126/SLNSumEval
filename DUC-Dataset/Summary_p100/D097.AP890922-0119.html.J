   Late Thursday there was hope
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   that Hugo might miss Charleston,
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   but the storm gathered strength
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   as it slammed into the city packing 135 mph winds.

   Mayor Joseph Riley Jr., other city officials and several reporters stayed in Charleston's historic City Hall Thursday night as the area's worst hurricane in three decades roared through.

   Before the night ended,
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   a portion of the 188-year-old building's roof was ripped off
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   and phone and power were knocked out.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   As the storm faded before dawn,
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   Riley was out on the streets assessing the damage.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   "Serious,
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   but fixable,"
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   the mayor concluded.
