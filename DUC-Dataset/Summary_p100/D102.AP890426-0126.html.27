   ``She was old and, of course, I knew about the heart attack, so I was not shocked by her death,'' said Keith Thibodeaux, who at age 6 began playing Miss Ball's drum-playing son on the comedy series that continues in syndication around the world.

   Thibodeaux, 38, said he got his break in show business when big band leader Horace Heidt persuaded his father to bring him from Lafayette, La., to California for the ``Swift Premium Hour,'' a traveling radio show that led to a string of one-night stands across the country.
