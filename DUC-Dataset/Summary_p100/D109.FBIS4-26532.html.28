   He inspected the flooded areas, including Zhuzhou City's Xiawan dike, the Hexi New and High Technology Development Zone, and Linghuayuan and Xiangtan's Yangtianhu, Xingxiadi, Zhoujiangdi, and Shiwandalou, where rescue and relief work was in full swing.

   He said: In fighting floods and doing relief work, the broad masses of cadres and people in Zhuzhou and Xiangtan sacrificed their interests to rescue a large number of industrial and mining enterprises, the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, the 107 National Highway, and cities and thus minimized the losses caused by floods.
