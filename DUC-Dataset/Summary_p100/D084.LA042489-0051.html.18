   The scarred battleship Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors. The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber "bloomers" that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse . On NBC's "Meet the Press," Cheney called the ships "one way to supplement" the usefulness of carrier battle groups "in terms of a show of force and showing the flag" .
