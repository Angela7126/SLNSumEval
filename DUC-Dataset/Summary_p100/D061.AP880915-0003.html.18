   At midnight EDT Gilbert was centered near latitude 21.5 north, longitude 90.2 west and approaching the north coast of Yucatan, about 60 miles east-northeast of the provincial capital, Merida, the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said.

   By Wednesday night the National Hurricane Center downgraded it to a Category 4, but center director Bob Sheets said:``There's no question it'll strengthen again once it comes off the Yucatan Peninsula and gets back in open water''.
