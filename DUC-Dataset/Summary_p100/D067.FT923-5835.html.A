   (GA), the leading British insurer, estimated yesterday
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   that its losses from Hurricane Andrew might reach $40 million;
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   however, GA has only a half-percent share of the Florida market and the estimate is based on the assumption
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   that GA's catastrophe insurance would be triggered by the extensive claims.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   The company's loss adjustors guess that losses to all insurers might exceed $8 billion.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Other insurers have estimated that losses from the storm
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   that hit Florida and Louisiana might be anywhere from $1 billion to $20 billion.
  </a>

   At this time no one is certain of the extent of losses.
