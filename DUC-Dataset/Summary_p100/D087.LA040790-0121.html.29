   Someday, Milan Bakes of Czechoslovakia might find himself the toast of Pilsen, his hometown. As one of the world's finest small-bore free-rifle shooters, he is coming close . By scoring 396 of a possible 400 points, Bakes broke the record set last week in Mexico City by Yugoslavia's Rajmond Debevec . He has yet to hold the prone record, but his 397 in that discipline helped him take a big lead in one of three medal events Friday . Counting the 10-shot shoot-off, Bakes finished with 1,275.9 points out of 1,309 .
