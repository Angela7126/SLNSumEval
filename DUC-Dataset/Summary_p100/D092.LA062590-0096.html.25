   ORANGE COUNTY AND NEEDLES
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Orange County's Iranian community launched an ambitious effort on June 23, 1990 to collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people in earthquake-ravaged Iran. Representatives of 11 Iranian professional and community groups manned tables near William R. Mason Regional Park, where contributors dropped off supplies, pledged other aid or made financial contributions . I have been in contact with a group that raised $150,000 (Saturday) by telephoning from home to home.
