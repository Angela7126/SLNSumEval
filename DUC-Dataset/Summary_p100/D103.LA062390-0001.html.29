   Shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday, San Diego resident Mohammad Nyakoui got a call from his wife, who is spending the summer in the Caspian Sea coastal city of Rasht, Iran, with her family. About 15 minutes after she hung up, Rasht and other cities in Iran's northern region were rocked by an earthquake that killed thousands . Back home in San Diego, it was several hours before Nyakoui even heard news of the quake.
