   Investigators Sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of three bridges over the Wegee and Pipe creeks.

   Rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks,
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   forming dams at each bridge.

   The "dams" broke under the water pressure.
