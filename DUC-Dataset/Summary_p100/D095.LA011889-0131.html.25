   Police officials said they still had not determined what set off Purdy, a troubled drifter in his mid-20s with a history of relatively minor brushes with the law. Investigators had not yet determined if any teachers at Cleveland Elementary were there when Purdy was in attendance from 1969 to 1973 . Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a powerful assault rifle on a crowded school playground on Jan. 16, 1989, killing five children and wounding 29 more, had been a student at the school from kindergarten through third grade, officials said on Jan. 18, 1989 .
