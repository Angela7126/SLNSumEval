   Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall border post that symbolized the Cold War, was hoisted into history today. As a brass band played and foreign ministers of the four World War II allies watched, a crane lifted the prefabricated hut with its American, British and French flags and placed it on a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum . Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in the middle of the Friedrichstrasse boulevard after Communist East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of West Berlin .
