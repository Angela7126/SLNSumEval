   In local elections across Britain yesterday, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever,
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   losing 444 seats.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   They are now the third party nationally.

  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Some anti-John Major Conservatives are happy about the defeat.

  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Propelled to power by Margaret Thatcher
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   who expected to continue her program discretely,
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Major is a weak leader.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Though some pushed him to pursue new "leftist" policies,
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   Major vacillates to the left and to the right,
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   producing a "crisis of honor."
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   He lacks vision, is incompetent on domestic and international issues,
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   and is a political blunderer.
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   The Tories will make him a scapegoat for their defeat at the polls.
