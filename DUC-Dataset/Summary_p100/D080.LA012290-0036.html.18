   A Hermosa Beach minister who for years has tried in vain to quell rumors tying his [SHAWN HUBLER] church to the McMartin Pre-School scandal announced Sunday that the "extreme stress" of fallout from the case has forced him to seek disability retirement. The Rev. John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church -- where McMartin pupils claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals -- told the congregation during his sermon that, "after much prayer and consultation," he realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims . The McMartin case, which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history, ended Thursday with the acquittal of defendants Ray Buckey and Peggy McMartin Buckey on a total of 52 counts of child molestation at the Manhattan Beach school .
