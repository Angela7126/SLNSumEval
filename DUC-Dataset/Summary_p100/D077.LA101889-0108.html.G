   Experience of a reporter at Candlestick Park for the World Series the night of the 1989 San Francisco quake:
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   I was sitting in a trailer outside the stadium
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   when the earthquake hit.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   I looked out
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   and the stadium was shaking.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   A special concrete joint on top of the stadium was opening and closing like cardboard.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   A few people were running out.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   I walked into the stadium
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   to interview fans
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   and sensed little panic.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   Most people stayed, waiting to hear
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   whether the game would be postponed.
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   When leaving, those in the upper deck seemed more shaken that those in lower levels.
