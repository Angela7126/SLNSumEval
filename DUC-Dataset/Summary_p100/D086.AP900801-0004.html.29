   The attack started about midnight, Kuwaiti time (5 p.m. Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's revenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.
