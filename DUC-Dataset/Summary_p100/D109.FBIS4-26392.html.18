   BFN [Text] Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, after the largest or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of China occurred a few days ago in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, and Gan Jiang rivers, water levels in these rivers are dropping slowly; however, high water levels will remain in these rivers for the next few days.

   Drops in water levels in Guangdong's Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang do not mean that Guangdong's flooding situations have eased, because flood waters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang will remain at high levels for quite long a period and will enter the sea after the two flood waters jointly flow through the low-lying Zhujiang Delta.
