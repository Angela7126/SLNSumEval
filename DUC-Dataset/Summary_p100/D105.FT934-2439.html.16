   FT 14 DEC 93 / Challenge of peacekeeping: A possible framework for co-operation Respect for the sovereignty of the newly independent countries must remain paramount.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   We agreed that the principles underlying Russian, CIS or international peacekeeping operations would need to include: strict respect for the sovereignty of the countries involved; an invitation from the government concerned and the consent of the parties to the conflict; commitment to a parallel political peace process; a clear mandate setting out the role of the peacekeeping forces (which should whenever possible be multinational in character); and an exit strategy for the peacekeeping forces deployed.
