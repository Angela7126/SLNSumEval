   A flash flood sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high rampaging through hill communities along the Ohio River, killing at least 10 people and leaving dozens missing, authorities said today. Shadyside -- about 10 miles south of Wheeling, W.Va. -- is in Belmont County, a mostly hilly, rural area in eastern Ohio . Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River . There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont, and Licking County in central Ohio .
