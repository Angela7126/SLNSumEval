   Someday, Milan Bakes of Czechoslovakia might find himself the toast of Pilsen, his hometown. Bakes, 27, set a world record in the kneeling portion of the three-position rifle competition Friday en route to a gold medal at the 1990 World Cup USA Olympic-style shooting tournament at Petersen's Prado Tiro Ranges in Chino . By scoring 396 of a possible 400 points, Bakes broke the record set last week in Mexico City by Yugoslavia's Rajmond Debevec . He has yet to hold the prone record, but his 397 in that discipline helped him take a big lead in one of three medal events Friday .
