   So four nights after Bernstein's death at age 72, Beethoven's "Violin Concerto" became Bernstein's "Serenade for Solo Violin, String Orchestra, Harp and Percussion" (1954); Shostakovich's "Symphony No. 4" became Bernstein's "Symphony No. 1 (Jeremiah)," written in 1942=2E The official catalog of his works says Bernstein led 74 orchestras.
