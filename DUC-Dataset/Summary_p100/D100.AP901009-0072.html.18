   ``Lennon always symbolized for us somebody who was able to handle rock and roll with a sense of humor and later, even more importantly, as someone who cared for the rights of an individual, human rights in general, and who had the right concept of freedom and peace,'' said Ondrej Konrad, the editor of Czechoslovakia's leading popular music publication.
