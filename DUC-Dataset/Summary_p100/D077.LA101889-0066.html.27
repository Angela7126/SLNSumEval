   Tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San Francisco quake on April 18, 1906, came in a place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in Northern California within the next 30 years.

   The epicenter of the temblor, eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains, was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on June 27, 1988, and Aug. 8, 1989.

   The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake.
