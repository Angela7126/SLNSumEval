   East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.

   ADN, quoting a Health Ministry statement, said Honecker was still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in January and was not well enough to be incarcerated.

   Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was ousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist government and the opening of the Berlin Wall.
