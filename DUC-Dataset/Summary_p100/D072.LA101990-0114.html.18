   At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin its three-year release of "The Bernstein Collection": "We will release 75 CDs of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD". In Los Angeles, Carol Brown, West Coast manager of sales and marketing for BMG Classics/RCA Red Seal, told The Times on Thursday that her label now plans a March release of recordings by Bernstein conducting the RCA Symphony in Copland's "Billy the Kid" and a suite from Bernstein's "On the Town," recordings made in the 1940s, and representing the conductor/composer's first commercial recordings .
