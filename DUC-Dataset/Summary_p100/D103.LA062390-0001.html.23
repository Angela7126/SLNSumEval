   Shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday, San Diego resident Mohammad Nyakoui got a call from his wife, who is spending the summer in the Caspian Sea coastal city of Rasht, Iran, with her family. "I asked her what she was doing, and she said she was watching the World Cup," Nyakoui recalls . One of about 25,000 San Diego Iranians in the same anxious state, Nyakoui was luckier than most: His wife managed to call him a second time that day, about eight hours after the quake, to tell him she and their two children were safe .
