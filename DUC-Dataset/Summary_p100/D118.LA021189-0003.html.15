   Lawmakers from both parties have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of interest hanging over Tower because of his employment by weapons firms, which brought him at least $760,000 in 2 1/2 years -- not including the more than $200,000 British Aerospace paid him.

   Sources said the apparent discrepancy in testimony raises the prospect that Tower could be recalled to testify under oath about his work for the firm.
