   A biography that portrays John Lennon as a drug - addled, anorexic bisexual who raged his way from Liverpool to New York City is ` ` totally fiction, '' Yoko Ono said in a national radio broadcast.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The usually reclusive Ono agreed to the interview to counter Goldman 's ` ` The Lives of John Lennon, '' which presents the ex - Beatle as a violent, drug - addicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Ono refuted virtually all of these charges, and countered through taped interviews with Lennon friends and employees that Goldman 's book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes.
