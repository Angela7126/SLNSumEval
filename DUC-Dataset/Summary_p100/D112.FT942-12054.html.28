   Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The writs were filed late last week in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan by trustees for Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme and Maxwell Communication Corpora-tion Works Pension Scheme.

  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m of MCC shares from the pension schemes by two Swiss trusts, Servex and Yakosa, which were transacted through Goldman and for which the schemes were never paid.
