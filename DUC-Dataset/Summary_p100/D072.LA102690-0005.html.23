   I assume that anyone who was ever touched by the genius of Leonard Bernstein will have his own memory of the Renaissance man of music, as you aptly described him (Part A, Oct. 15). Mine dates back to October, 1948, when I was serving as an American volunteer in the Israeli army during the country's War of Independence . With a two-day pass in hand, I hitchhiked to Jerusalem, where the Israeli equivalent of the USO scrounged up a ticket for the evening's performance of the Israel Philharmonic, with Bernstein as the guest conductor .
