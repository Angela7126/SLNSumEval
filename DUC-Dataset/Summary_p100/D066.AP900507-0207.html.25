   THE STORY OF SAM WALTON
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Don Shinkle, Wal-Mart's director of corporate and public affairs, attributed Wal-Mart's success to its "associates" the term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart employees are partners in the company and to Sam Walton's leadership and knack for hiring the "right person at the right time".

   Walton "said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores" and needed someone to tend the shop in Bentonville while he and his brother built a chain of Ben Franklins, Bogle said in a recent interview.
