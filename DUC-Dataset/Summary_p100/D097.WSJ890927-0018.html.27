   "Hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record," said one official, far surpassing the $752.5 million insurers paid out after Frederick ripped through several Gulf Coast states in 1979.

   Yet, some analysts believe Hugo's huge losses will make a dent in the industry's capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months.

   Mr. Ruoff at Fred S. James believes that even if losses from Hugo total as much as $5 billion, insurers won't feel enough "financial pain, such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends," to compel them to boost premium rates right away.
