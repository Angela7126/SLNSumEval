   In the recent San Francisco earthquake, why did some luxury four-story apartments or office buildings collapse while high-rises escaped virtually unscathed?
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Accordingly, some buildings collapsed because of two things:
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   very poor soil and very poor structural design.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Some were built over landfill and others were erected earlier
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   when there were no earthquake codes.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Four-story buildings with garages underneath have no walls on one side.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Connections break and the front falls.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Skyscrapers usually survive because architects factor in wind gusts and earth movement.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   In smaller buildings, contractors make sure
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   that vertical forces -such as snow and ice- cannot force a collapse.
