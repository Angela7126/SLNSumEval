   In support of an estimated 3,000 colleagues striking for a second day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie, workers at the nearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools and launched their own occupation strike.

   The mine is about 12 miles south of July Manifesto, where strikers were demanding legalization of the outlawed independent labor federation, pay raises and reinstatement of workers fired for trade union activites.
