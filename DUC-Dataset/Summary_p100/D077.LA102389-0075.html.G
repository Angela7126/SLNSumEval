   The cities of Charleston, SC and San Francisco have similarities and differences
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   when they were the scenes of two back-to-back disasters:
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Hurricane Hugo and the Bay Area earthquake.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Charleston had warning
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   but San Francisco did not.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Charleston's neighborhoods were littered with debris,
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   80% of the buildings were damaged,
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   and power was out.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   San Francisco's streets were passable within a day and power was restored overnight.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   Charleston, however, in contrast to San Francisco, could quickly assess structural damage
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   and it lost no major economic area such as the Bay Bridge.
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   Both have experienced delays in disaster relief from the federal government.
