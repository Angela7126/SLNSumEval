   British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell,
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   who publishes Britain's Daily Mirror,
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   said Monday he is involved in negotiations
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   to buy a U.S. newspaper worth "hundreds of millions of dollars."
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   The newspaper was not identified
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   but there is speculation that it might be The New York Daily News,
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   which is struggling to restore profitability;
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   USA Today, which would mesh with Maxwell's efforts for the new paper The European;
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   or the Chicago Sun-Times that has been sliding in circulation since 1985.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   Officials of each of these newspapers denied they were negotiating with Maxwell,
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   who recently bought three US tabloids: the Globe, National Examiner, and the Sun.
