   British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell said Monday that he is involved in negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper valued "in the hundreds of millions of dollars". Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but his comments prompted industry speculation that it might be Gannett's USA Today, Tribune Co.'s New York Daily News or the Chicago Sun-Times . Officials of each of those newspapers denied that they were negotiating with Maxwell . Some analysts said it might make sense for Maxwell to try to purchase USA Today, since it would mesh well with his efforts to print and distribute his month-old "pan-European" English-language paper, The European, in this country .
