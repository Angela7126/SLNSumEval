   A tornado slammed into a shopping district, a residential area and a school Wednesday, killing at least 14 people, injuring nearly 300 and trapping many others in their cars and homes, police said. "Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment complexes and shopping areas," said police spokesman Ben Jennings after the twister touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in this northeastern Alabama city . "It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold of," said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when the twister struck .
