   Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake that left an estimated 25,000 people dead in northern Iran. But subsequent reports, some a few minutes apart, said the damage must have been principally to crops, with brief mentions that many casualties were feared in Zanjan and Gilan provinces . Official radio was off the air when the earthquake struck, and although it came back on the air to report important news during the Iran-Iraq War, there was no such move Thursday.
