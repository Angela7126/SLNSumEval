   I assume that anyone who was ever touched by the genius of Leonard Bernstein will have his own memory of the Renaissance man of music, as you aptly described him (Part A, Oct. 15). Mine dates back to October, 1948, when I was serving as an American volunteer in the Israeli army during the country's War of Independence . Toward the end of the first movement, machine-gun fire started crackling from the old city, held by the Jordanian Legion, and continued intermittently through the rest of the symphony.
