   Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called ``Lucona'' scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee.

   In several interviews, Gratz described himself as a close friend of Proksch, but when Proksch fled to escape prosecution, Gratz criticized him.

   Gratz told Parliament today he would give up his seat in February, hence his post as president, one of the most prestigious posts in Austria.
