   Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake that left an estimated 25,000 people dead in northern Iran. And the Islamic revolution that in 1979 toppled the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi cost hundreds of thousands of lives . But subsequent reports, some a few minutes apart, said the damage must have been principally to crops, with brief mentions that many casualties were feared in Zanjan and Gilan provinces . The only detail reported for hours was that, when the quake hit, Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer match between Brazil and Scotland .
