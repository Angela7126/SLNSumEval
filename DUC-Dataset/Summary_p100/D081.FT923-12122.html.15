   WORKERS AT KGHM, Poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterday as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country's pits in a major challenge to the government's economic policies.

   The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unions representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by 20 per cent.

   Further increases could only come if the government eased prohibitive wage control taxes, thus providing a powerful precedent for wage demands by other groups.
