   Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington. Boucher said Iran told the U.S. government that private donor agencies should contact the Iranian Red Crescent, a humanitarian group that is the conduit for all outside assistance . Rescuers in Iran today freed thousands of people from buildings flattened by the earthquake in northern Iran, which struck early Thursday and had a magnitude between 7.3 and 7.7 .
