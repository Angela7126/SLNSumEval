   The high-spirited star of "I Love Lucy," a show that the nation took to its heart as no other and that continues in syndication around the world, died of a ruptured abdominal aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital spokesman Ronald Wise said. Miss Ball, who had a heart attack and had throat surgery in 1988, underwent surgery at Cedars-Sinai on April 18 to replace her aorta and aortic valve and had been getting out of bed, eating and even walking around the room in recent days .
