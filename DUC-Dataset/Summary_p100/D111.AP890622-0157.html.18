   A deep-sea inspection of the Bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in Adolf Hitler's navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer Robert D. Ballard said Thursday.

   In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking hundreds of hits _ its sinking clearly inevitable.

   Asked if the German commander couldn't have surrendered by ceasing fire, Ballard said ``in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the Germans were giving up.
