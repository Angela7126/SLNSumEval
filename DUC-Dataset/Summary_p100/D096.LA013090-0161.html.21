   Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched television event of the week, viewed by a whopping 63% of TV viewers, but not even Joe Montana could lift CBS out of the cellar in the ratings race, it was reported today. On the upside for CBS -- Super Bowl XXIV carried enough of its audience over to the debut of the new series, "Grand Slam," to provide a good audience sampling and give the action show a ranking of 15th for the night . But last Sunday's game had almost twice as many viewers as the estimated 59.19 million who watched Kansas City beat Minnesota 20 years ago .
