   The White House, according to a U.S. official, hasn't yet informed the Senate, which must confirm the nominations of Mr. Pickering and Foreign Service Director General Edward Perkins, a former U.S. envoy to South Africa.

   During the 1980s, when the Reagan administration drew the line against communist-backed insurgences in Central America, Mr. Pickering played an active role in that effort as U.S. envoy to El Salvador.

   Mr. Perkins was the U.S. ambassador to South Africa in 1986, when the U.S. imposed economic sanctions against that nation's white-minority government to pressure it to end apartheid.
