   A study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia showed

   that laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks,

   suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of TGF beta than rats

   that did not receive TGF beta.

   The TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor necrosis factor,
