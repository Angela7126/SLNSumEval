   A dozen of the 47 sailors killed in an explosion aboard the battleship Iowa have undergone pathology exams, and an official said four of them were dressed in full military uniform and sent to their hometowns Saturday for burial. Air Force spokesman Capt. Walter Thorp said Saturday it will take as long as 10 days to complete the pathology process on the remaining 35 sailors who died when gunpowder exploded in the No. 2 turret of the Iowa on Wednesday, as the World War II-era battleship was conducting an exercise 200 miles northeast of Puerto Rico .
