   Hirohito's blood pressure fell from 132 over 60 in the afternoon to 112 over 50 by evening, and his pulse from 104 per minute in the morning to 84 in the evening, said Kenji Maeda, chief of the Imperial Household Agency's General Affairs Division.

   Hirohito has received nearly 22 pints of blood since his illness worsened Sept. 19, and the transfusions had put a strain on Hirohito's heart and kidneys, Maeda said without elaborating.
