   The Walt Disney Co. filed suit in Los Angeles federal court Thursday against the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, charging copyright infringement of its Snow White character and unfair competition. Disney spokesman Erwin Okun did not provide any details of Thursday's negotiations with academy officials over an apology, except to say that the academy's offer "was not to our satisfaction" . At that point, the Disney statement said, the academy, "through a legal representative, denied to Disney that the Academy Award program contained any material deleterious to the interests of Disney, without revealing the academy's intention to feature Disney's Snow White" .
