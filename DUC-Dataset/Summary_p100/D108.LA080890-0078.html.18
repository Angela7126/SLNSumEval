   Invading Iraqis have been permitted to take over the homes and even wear the clothes of Kuwaitis who have been killed or have fled their homeland, Kuwait's ambassador to the United States charged Tuesday. Sheik Saud al Nasir al Sabah said in an interview that he had spoken by telephone to several Kuwaitis taking refuge in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, who reported that the Iraqis had made it easy for them to leave . "They are trucking them in, busing them in, trying to replace the population, to change the makeup of the place," Saud said, adding they were issuing the new residents cards that identify them as Kuwaiti citizens .
