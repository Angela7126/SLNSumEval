   THE STORY OF COMBEST
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued a terse statement on Feb. 27, 1989 supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower but refused to comment on a published report that he told Senate Armed Services Committee leaders that Tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting.

   An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combest's statement about Tower's drinking habits in the 1970s came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, "like a ton of bricks" and was a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination.
