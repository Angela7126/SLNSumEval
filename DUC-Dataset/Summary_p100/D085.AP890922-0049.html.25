   "This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced," warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.

   The storm, packing winds of up to 135 mph, raged into Charleston on Sept. 20, 1989 night.
