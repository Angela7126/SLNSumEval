   The longest, costliest, criminal trial in history ended Thursday
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   when Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty on 52 counts in the McMartin Pre-School child molestation case.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The jury deadlocked on 13 counts.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Buckey did not comment,
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   while his mother displayed anger.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   The judge said he was not surprised.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Parents and jurors criticized the prosecution,
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   which blamed the system.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   The sordid case began in 1983
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   and created a media frenzy and hysterical parents.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   The 18-month preliminary hearing brought 135 charges against seven people.
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   Many charges were dropped,
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   but the trial lasted more than 2 years.
