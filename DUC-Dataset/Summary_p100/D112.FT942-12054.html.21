   Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The trustees seek more than Dollars 100m for the sale of shares plus interest, commission charges and punitive damages from Goldman and Mr Eric Sheinberg, partner in charge of international equities trading.
  </a>

   The writs centre on the purchase of Pounds 55m of MCC shares from the pension schemes by two Swiss trusts, Servex and Yakosa, which were transacted through Goldman and for which the schemes were never paid.
