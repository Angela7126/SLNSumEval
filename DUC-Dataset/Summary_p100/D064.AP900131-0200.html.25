   SANDWICHS AND RUBLES
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Jan. 30, 1990 cheerfully lined up to get a taste of "gamburgers, chizburgers" and "Filay-o-feesh" sandwiches as McDonald's opened in the land of Lenin for the first time.

   Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's staffer or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently.
