   The official news agency said coal miners in Vorkuta in the far north, the Don River city of Rostov in southwestern Russia and the Ukrainian industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk walked out Wednesday.

   Tass said their demands were similar to those of striking miners in the Donetsk and Kuznetsk coal basins, who are seeking greater local control over their industries and better wages and living conditions.

   Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, are the country's two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to the country's worst labor unrest since the 1920s.
