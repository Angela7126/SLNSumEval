   Immediately after disembarking from the plane, Wen Jiabao and his party -- accompanied by Mao Zhiyong, secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, and Governor Wu Guanzheng -- successively rushed to the Nanchang Bridge, the Leigongao construction work site along the Nanchang-Jiujiang Highway which is reserved for vehicles, Weidong Village under Changling Town in Xinjian County, and Houtian Township's Sanzhou Village.

   While continually and properly conducting flood-fighting and relief work along the Ganjiang River valleys, we should stress flood-prevention in the Poyang Lake area and should promptly organize the masses in the disaster-stricken areas to resume production so as to be self-reliant and to rebuild their homes.
