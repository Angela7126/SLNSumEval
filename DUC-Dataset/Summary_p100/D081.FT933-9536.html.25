   COAL IN BUCHAREST
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Coalminers from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the government for higher wages.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, Cosma has the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Mr Cosma, however, appears confident.
