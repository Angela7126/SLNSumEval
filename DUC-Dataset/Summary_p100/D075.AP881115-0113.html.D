   A study found

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs,
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   they usually don't need the extra step of a common balloon procedure,
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   known as angioplasty.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   The clot-dissolving factor known as TPA,
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   dramatically improved the survival chances of heart attack victims.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   When groups
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   who underwent angioplasty were compared to groups
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   who received TPA
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   and only those with lingering heart pain or other symptoms underwent angioplasty, there was no difference in survival rates.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   The results mean
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   that most patients can be treated in community hospitals

  <a href="#13" id="13">
   where angioplasty is not available and that the nation could save $704 million in medical bills.
