   RENINS AND RENIN PROFILES
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Only 12% of the patients had high renin "profiles".
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   But the seven heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidence of heart attacks among the patients, 13 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years of observation.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The incidence in the high renin patients was more than double the incidence in those with a normal renin profile -- 5.3 heart attacks per 1,000 person-years -- and more than triple that of the patients with a low renin profile, 3.3 per 1,000 person-years, Drs. Alderman, Laragh and their respective colleagues reported.
