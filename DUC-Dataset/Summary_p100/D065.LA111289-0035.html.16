   One year after his election, Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has become dull. That joke was not only funny, but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon: Americans didn't give a damn about the vice presidency (Mike Dukakis tried to make Quayle a major issue and failed), but some also felt that Quayle wasn't qualified for a job that had no qualifications . (If Quayle had been told the questioners were going to be Hunter Thompson and Jimmy Breslin, I have a feeling Quayle might have come down with laryngitis) .
