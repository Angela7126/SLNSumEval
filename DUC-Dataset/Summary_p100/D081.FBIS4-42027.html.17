   BFN [ Text ] Donetsk Oblast [ no date as received ] -- as UNIAN reported, miners at the "Ordzhonikidzevuhillya" coal production association and the "Yenakiyevo" and "Poltava" pits went on strike in Yenakiyevo on 27 June, demanding payment of wage arrears.

   In the opinion of the mine's representatives, who wished not to be identified, the strike has a clear political hue -- to attempt to compromise the existing authorities and, particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round of presidential elections.
