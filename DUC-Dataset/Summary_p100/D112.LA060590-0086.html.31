   Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but his comments prompted industry speculation that it might be Gannett's USA Today, Tribune Co.'s New York Daily News or the Chicago Sun-Times.

   Some analysts said it might make sense for Maxwell to try to purchase USA Today, since it would mesh well with his efforts to print and distribute his month-old "pan-European" English-language paper, The European, in this country.

   Maxwell has already been in negotiations with USA Today officials about printing the paper for U.S. distribution.
