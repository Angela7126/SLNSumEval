  <a href="#2" id="2">
   A dozen of the 47 sailors killed in an explosion aboard the battleship Iowa have undergone pathology exams, and an official said four of them were dressed in full military uniform and sent to their hometowns on Apr. 21, 1989 for burial. As Navy officials continued their inquiry into the explosion, sailors aboard the Wisconsin, sister ship to the Iowa, opened their ship on Apr. 21, 1989 in Norfolk, Va., to talk about their pride in battleships and the sense of loss .
