   Lawmakers from both parties have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of interest hanging over Tower because of his employment by weapons firms, which brought him at least $760,000 in 2 1/2 years -- not including the more than $200,000 British Aerospace paid him.

   Federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that Tower was aware that his 1984 campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants employed by former Unisys executive Charles F. Gardner, said to be a central figure in the Pentagon bribery investigation.
