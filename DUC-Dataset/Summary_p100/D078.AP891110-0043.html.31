   The Oscar statuette, one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alike made by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, diluted the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.

   Although Waters acknowledged that the Creative House trophy is ``very similar'' to the Oscar, he rejected all of the academy's legal claims, saying that the statuette became part of the public domain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright Act of 1976.

   The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette and that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscar and the Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected.
