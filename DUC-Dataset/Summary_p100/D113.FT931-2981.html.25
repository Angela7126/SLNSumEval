   FLAT IN INDIA
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   On Mar. 11, 1993 a series of car bombs exploded in Bombay in what the government described as a systematic attack on India's commercial heart.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of Bowbazaar shortly after midnight, causing two blocks of flats to collapse and trapping up to 70 people in the rubble.

   Some fear the wave of bomb attacks is designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and undermine efforts by the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism.
