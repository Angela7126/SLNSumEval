   COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the government for higher wages.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   It has instead begun legal action to have the strike, which today entered its second week, declared illegal.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The miners' position seems untenable.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Romanians appear solidly opposed to the strike, angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the equivalent of Dollars 290 a month.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Most workers earn less than Dollars 80.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.
