   A West German newspaper reported
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   that ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will not stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist country exists,
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   although he could be prosecuted in a united Germany for violation of property laws.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Honecker allegedly used $42 million for stocking a private housing estate for Communist government leaders.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   However, the investigation is not far enough along
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   to determine whether charges would be filed against Honecker before the East German-West German merger.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   He is under investigation for abuse of power, corruption, harboring terrorists,
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   and issuing shoot-to-kill orders against East Germans escaping to West Germany.
