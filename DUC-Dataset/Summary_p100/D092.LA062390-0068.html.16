   State Department officials said the government gave $300,000 worth of supplies to the American Red Cross for shipment to Iran -- including 1,000 hard hats, 1,000 pairs of leather gloves, 10,000 face masks, 2,940 wool blankets and about 500 tents. The American Red Cross responded by mobilizing its local offices to solicit money, informing its toll-free telephone operators to request earmarked donations for the earthquake victims and sending $50,000 in cash to the Red Crescent Society to be used to help needy Iranians . "Iran needs assistance, and such organizations are welcome to send it" .
