   Orange County's Iranian community launched an ambitious effort Sunday to collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people in earthquake-ravaged Iran. Representatives of 11 Iranian professional and community groups manned tables near William R. Mason Regional Park, where contributors dropped off supplies, pledged other aid or made financial contributions . Organizer Genia Panahi, 40, of Newport Beach, said the 150 Iranian doctors practicing in Orange County responded to calls for medicine, surgical gloves, disposable needles and blood bags .
