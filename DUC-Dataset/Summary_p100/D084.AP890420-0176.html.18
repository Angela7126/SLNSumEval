   The bodies of 47 sailors killed in the gun explosion on the Iowa arrived in the United States on Thursday as the Navy tried to figure out what caused the battleship's turret to blow up.

   The Iowa was headed back to its home port at Norfolk, Va., while the bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and families of the battleship's 1,600 crewmen waited to learn whether their relatives were among the dead.

   The only officer killed was Lt. j.g. Phillip Edward Buch from Las Cruces, N.M., who would normally be in a small compartment at the rear of the swivelling top of the turret, adjacent to the room in which shells are loaded.
