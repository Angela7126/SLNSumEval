   The visit by human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the U.S. A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissident movement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal exile after criticizing the Kremlin's military drive into Afghanistan.

   Some statements and articles by Sakharov have been printed in the Soviet media since then, including an article last week in a magazine that opposed some elements of Gorbachev's blueprint for political and electoral reforms.
