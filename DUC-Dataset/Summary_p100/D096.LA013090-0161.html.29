   Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched television event of the week, viewed by a whopping 63% of TV viewers, but not even Joe Montana could lift CBS out of the cellar in the ratings race, it was reported today. CBS estimates that 109 million viewers saw all or part of the game, down only 2 million from last year despite the fact that this year's match was a blowout . Each rating point in 1990, however, represents many more households than it did two decades ago.
