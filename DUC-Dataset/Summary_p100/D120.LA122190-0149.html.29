   British Prime Minister John Major said today that Iraqi troops will have to be "forcibly removed" from Kuwait if President Saddam Hussein does not agree to withdraw them peacefully. "I hope it won't come to that -- everyone hopes it won't come to that -- but it could" . In contrast to Thatcher, he was polite to reporters questioning him . Hussein, he said, "has to go" .
