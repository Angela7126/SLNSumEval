Laurel declined Saturday night to condemn the armed insurrection in his country and said the rebels "have the right" to try to seize power. Laurel added that Aquino now is "completely beholden" to the United States just as exploratory talks on renegotiating leases for Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, the two largest U.S. military facilities abroad, are beginning .
