   One year after his election, Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has become dull .
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   His coming-out party last Sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make news.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   He went on "Meet the Press" .
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   This was no small thing.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   During his entire campaign for the vice presidency, Quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   He didn't appear on "Meet the Press" or "This Week With David Brinkley" or "Face the Nation" .
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   And he didn't do so because back then he was making too much news.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   His every slip, his every gaffe, his every goof was news .
