   Bakes, 27, set a world record in the kneeling portion of the three-position rifle competition on Apr. 5, 1990 en route to a gold medal at the 1990 World Cup USA Olympic-style shooting tournament at Petersen's Prado Tiro Ranges in Chino. By scoring 396 of a possible 400 points, Bakes broke the record set the week of Mar. 31, 1990 in Mexico City by Yugoslavia's Rajmond Debevec . Bakes once held the record for standing, too, but that was four years ago.
