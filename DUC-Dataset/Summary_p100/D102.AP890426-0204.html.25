   THE STORY OF GORDON
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Gordon, who is appearing in a play in Edmonton, spent the day in a Edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los Angeles hospital on Apr. 25, 1989 at age 77 and quietly remembering his funny friend.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Gordon last spoke to Miss Ball from Edmonton on his birthday, Feb. 20, when "she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has done for years and years".
