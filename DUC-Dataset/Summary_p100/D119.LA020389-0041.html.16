   President Bush has decided to nominate John D. Negroponte, a veteran diplomat who helped direct U.S. aid to Nicaraguan rebels, to the key position of ambassador to Mexico, Administration officials said Thursday. State Department officials said that they had expected Mexican leftists to register complaints about the appointment because of Negroponte's support of the Contras but that they are confident that Salinas' government will not object formally .
