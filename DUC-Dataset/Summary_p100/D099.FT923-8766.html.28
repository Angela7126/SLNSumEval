   TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and one of the most prestigious events of the Games will be held.

  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men's marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run.

  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The last 4.6km, which take the runners 60m higher still to the Olympic stadium at the top of the hill of Montjuic, has an average gradient of more than 4.5 per cent, and includes some sections of 7 per cent, equivalent in skiing terms to a steep 'red' run.
