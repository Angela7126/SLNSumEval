   Basically, his problem comes from serving more than one master.

   In what is fast becoming a pit-bull match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, John and Rita Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially retired (as announced in Dog News).
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   In the suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Mr. Attalla says, "Cory has achieved the pinnacle of success. . . and any further competition would only diminish what he has accomplished".
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   In the suit, he says that under the owners' agreement he lays out fees and other expenses for showing the animal and he decides when to show -- or to retire -- Cory.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   So far, Mr. Attalla says, he's spent over $125,000, the amount sought in damages.

   The Remondis are in charge of caring for the dog.

  <a href="#12" id="12">
   Despite the retirement, the suit says, the Remondis showed Cory twice recently.

   For now, a judge's order temporarily bars them from further shows.
  </a>
  <a href="#14" id="14">
   In a memo filed in court, Mr. Remondi claims that Mr. Attalla retired the dog "simply and solely to better" the chances that Mr. Attalla's agent would win with a rival Rover.

   They claim that Mr. Attalla has breached the pact by not paying certain expenses .
