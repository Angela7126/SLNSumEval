   The expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.

   The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.

   If the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves survival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would need to be established and more doctors trained to give the procedure.
