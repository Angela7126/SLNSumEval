<a href="#0" id="0">While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News said.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">``He was like the man from one of Maxim Gorky's tales who used his own bleeding and living heart as a torch to lead people to light and truth,'' said the woman, a teacher who declined to give her name.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">Lech Walesa, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said Sakharov's death was "a great loss for reform both in the Soviet Union and everywhere else." "He was just a remarkable person," said British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Gorbachev said he would attend Sakharov's funeral Monday afternoon in southwest Moscow's Vostryakovskoye Cemetery.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">He called for reversal of what he called the anti-democratic decision, which produced a list of what critics describe as old-guard managers of scientific institutions.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">The article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past charges leveled at Sakharov and his wife, fellow dissident Yelena Bonner, by Soviet officials and the state-controlled media.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">``The first three days of this week may become the `hottest' spring days for Soviet scientists,'' it said, alluding to the leadership's rejection of such reformers as Sakharov, space scientist Roald Sagdeev and sociologist Tatyana Zaslavsakaya.</a>
