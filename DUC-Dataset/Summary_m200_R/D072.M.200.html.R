<a href="#1" id="1">On his 25th birthday, Aug. 25, 1943, Bernstein was told by the Koussevitzkys that he should visit Artur Rodzinsky, newly appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic, at his Stockbridge, Conn., farm.</a>

<a href="#3" id="3">The capacity audience -invited friends, relatives and theatrical personalities as well as 850 members of the public who started lining up at 7 a.m. -heard recollections of an energetic Bernstein who danced until dawn in discos as well as a poignant account of his final days.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">When Koussevitzky retired in 1949, he tried to have the young Bernstein named as his successor, but the BSO's trustees chose Charles Munch because they considered Bernstein too young and tainted by popular music.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">``He could have gotten a rehearsal pianist, but he cared too much,'' Kert said.</a>
<a href="#6" id="6">Bernstein was a member of the original Tanglewood Music Center class of 1940, where he became a protege of Tanglewood founder Serge Koussevitzky.</a>
<a href="#7" id="7">Winging in from the West Coast (as was Walker) was Lauren Bacall, who teamed up with Phyllis Newman for a sly rendition of "Ohio" from Bernstein's "Wonderful Town."</a>
