    SCIENTISTS LAST YEAR HAD PINPOINTED TUESDAY'S SITE AS LIKELY TO BE JOLTED.
   </title>
   <text>
    <p>
     Tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the San Andreas fault since the San 
Francisco quake on April 18, 1906, came in a place that had been identified by 
scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in Northern 
California within the next 30 years.
    </p>
    <p>
     The epicenter of the temblor, eight miles east-northeast of the city of Santa 
Cruz in the Santa Cruz Mountains, was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes 
in the 5-magnitude range that occurred on June 27, 1988, and Aug. 8, 1989. A 
6.5-magnitude quake was centered there in 1865.
    </p>
    <p>
     The U.S. Geological Survey, in a 1988 report on regions of high earthquake 
probability in California, said there was a 30% chance of another 6.5-magnitude 
earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
     The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San 
Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern 
California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as 
the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area 
marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 
earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
     A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go, and during 
this time, scientists said Tuesday night, pressure was probably building up in 
the southern neighboring segment of the San Andreas, which had not slipped as 
much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thomas Heaton, the Geological Survey scientist in charge of the agency's 
Pasadena field office, said that the 1987 and 1988 earthquakes now must be seen 
as "preshocks" of the Tuesday's 6.9 temblor. He said "foreshocks" would not be 
the proper term, since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake 
struck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heaton said that a still larger shock is unlikely. But he joined Caltech 
scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as 5.9 magnitude should be 
expected, and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months. A 5.9 
aftershock would be as strong as the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los Angeles 
area.
    </p>
    <p>
     After both the 1987 and the 1988 earthquakes in the Santa Cruz mountains, the 
state Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Geological Survey issued 
warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes, ranging up to 6.5 magnitude, 
within the next few days in the vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these warnings said that if nothing happened, then the chances of a major 
earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity. The trouble was, the area 
was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the Bay Area on 
the San Andreas Fault. Only the nearby Hayward fault may harbor as great a 
danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the Bay Area.
    </p>
    <p>
     The San Andreas, the longest and best-known earthquake fault in California, 
extends from Point Arena in Mendocino County to the Salton Sea. It has been the 
site of the deadliest and most destructive earthquakes in the state's recorded 
history.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Tuesday's quake was powerful, Waverly Person, chief of the National 
Earthquake Information Service in Golden, Colo., cautioned that at 6.9 
magnitude, it should be considered only a "strong" shock, not a "major" one, as 
a quake in the 7.0 to 7.9 range would be classified, or a "great" one, as a 
quake of 8.0 or above would be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Person and others in the Geological Survey warned Tuesday night that the 
probability is 40% that a temblor more powerful than Tuesday's will strike in 
Southern California sometime in the next three decades.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, as it was, Tuesday's quake was about four times stronger than the 
devastating Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake of 1971 and 10 times stronger than 
the 1987 Whittier quake. Each point of magnitude represents a 10-fold increase 
in the power of an earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
     Person said that, like most San Andreas earthquakes, this was most likely to be 
a strike-slip quake, with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past 
another. But he said a final evaluation would have to await on-scene inspection 
teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the Geological 
Survey's Menlo Park office.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jim Dewey, a research geophysicist at the National Earthquake Center, said 
preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about 10 miles deep, 
and that the quake rupture extended about 30 miles south down the fault from 
the epicenter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Person said that the area of strongest shaking was around Santa Cruz, although 
this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations, as will a final 
confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
     The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake, San Jose, has seen 
nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but 
several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just 
east of San Jose, more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the Calaveras fault may 
have been a precursor, or somehow added pressure, on the San Andreas. But when 
a 5.1 earthquake did strike on the Calaveras in 1988, some earthquake 
scientists expressed concern that this could be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
     Between the late 1950s and 1979, there were no quakes of magnitude 5 or larger 
near the Bay Area. But in August, 1979, a 6.4-magnitude quake struck under 
Coyote Lake east of Gilroy and south of San Jose, and since then there have 
been a number of quakes.
    </p>
    <p>
     In August, Geological Survey scientists had expressed concern at the step-up in 
5-magnitude quakes south of the Bay Area. They noted that a similar series of 
moderately strong quakes had preceded the San Francisco quake of 1906.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, a New Mexico scientist who studies tidal forces, supported by two 
eyewitnesses, said Tuesday night that at a private lecture in San Francisco on 
Oct. 10, he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or 
about Oct. 16.
    </p>
    <p>
     Iben Browning, of Sandia Park, N. M., said he had based his prediction on an 
assessment of tidal forces caused by the moon's relationship with the Earth. He 
said he had decided to keep the assessment private because he feared that 
publicity about it would cause people to panic.
