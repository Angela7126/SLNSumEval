    THE WORLD SERIES; OAKLAND ATHLETICS VS. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS; EXPERIENCE AT CANDLESTICK IS ONE REPORTER WILL NOT SOON FORGET.

     There are events one never forgets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Anyone who was alive in 1963 remembers where he was when President Kennedy was 
assassinated.
    </p>
    <p>
     And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World 
Series will never forget.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when 
the earthquake hit. It was shortly after the network went on the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     My immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead, but soon I 
knew what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, 
mainly because I was awake this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     I opened the door to the trailer and looked out. The stadium was shaking and 
the special concrete joint -- one of several strategically spaced around the 
top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage -- was doing was it was 
designed to do. It was opening and closing as if the place was made of 
cardboard instead of concrete.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be 
great alarm, because the quake did not last long.
    </p>
    <p>
     I walked into the stadium to interview fans. And again, I sensed little panic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most people stayed in their seats, waiting to hear whether the game would be 
postponed.
    </p>
    <p>
     And later, when fans started leaving en masse, the reaction of those I talked 
to varied. Those who were sitting in the upper deck seemed considerably more 
shaken than those in the lower levels. LARRY STEWART
