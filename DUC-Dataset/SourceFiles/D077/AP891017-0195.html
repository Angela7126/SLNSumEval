    Earthquake Rocks San Francisco.

    A major earthquake rocked northern
California Tuesday evening, collapsing part of the San Francisco
Bay Bridge and shaking Candlestick Park and buildings up to 95
miles away.
   Some buildings may have collapsed, said Police Officer D.
Collins. There were reports of injuries at Candlestick, where fans
were waiting for the World Series to begin, and the stadium was
evacuated, ABC-TV and Cable News Network reported.
   The quake, which lasted about 15 seconds, measured 6.5 on the
Richter scale, according to seismologists at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The preliminary reading was
from the Alaska Tsunami warning system, Caltech said.
   Televised footage of the bridge showed that a 30-foot section of
the span's upper deck had collapsed onto the bottom level.
   Fans at Candlestick screamed as the stadium swayed for about 15
seconds. Players from the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland
Athletics were on the field and stood around as fans began to leave
their seats.
   Buildings in San Francisco swayed several feet.
   The quake shook buildings in Sacramento, 95 miles to the
northeast, and was felt as far away as Reno, Nev., 225 miles to the
east.
   The quake knocked out phones and power, including electricity at
The Associated Press' bureau in San Francisco.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.
