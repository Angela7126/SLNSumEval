    Precede MOSCOW; Soviet Miners' Strikes Spread to Four New Areas.
   </title>
   <text>
    Strikes by tens of thousands of
miners in this Siberian coal region spread to four more of the
Soviet Union's coal fields, Tass reported today.
   The official news agency said coal miners in Vorkuta in the far
north, the Don River city of Rostov in southwestern Russia and the
Ukrainian industrial center of Dnepropetrovsk walked out Wednesday.
   Miners in the Karaganda region in Soviet Central Asia today
refused to work, Tass said. By evening, 14 mines in the region, home
of the country's third-largest coal fields, were reported at a
standstill.
   Tass said their demands were similar to those of striking miners
in the Donetsk and Kuznetsk coal basins, who are seeking greater
local control over their industries and better wages and living
conditions.
   Kuznetsk, in western Siberia, and Donetsk, in the Ukraine, are
the country's two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to the
country's worst labor unrest since the 1920s. Novokuznetsk is a
major city in the Kuznetsk region, where the strikes began 10 days
ago.
   The government has acknowledged that living and working
conditions for miners in the regions are abysmal and has made
general pledges of improvements.
   Tass reported Wednesday that some miners in Siberia had returned
to work after the government made pay concessions.
   The government also has promised to send extra meat, butter,
sugar, tea, leather shoes, furniture and cars to relieve shortages
in the region, the Communist Youth League newspaper Komsomolskaya
Pravda said today.
   But the newspaper and Tass reported more disturbances in the
Ukraine. Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a communist official in the
Donetsk city of Makeyevka as saying, ``The scale of the strike is
growing. Practically all the coal enterprises of the city have
stopped work.''
   Miners in Vorkuta, Rostov and Dnepropetrovsk all walked off the
job on Wednesday, Tass said.
   In Vorkuta, strikers sent a letter to the Kremlin asking for an
``urgent resolution of the sharp economic and social problems of the
coal sector, and also specific problems of workers of the far
north,'' Tass said.
   In Rostov, miners' economic demands included extra pay for
evening and night shifts, longer vacations and an increase in the
price of coal to world market prices, the news agency reported.
   In Dnepropetrovsk, which is 150 miles from Donetsk, workers'
demands mirrored those of Donetsk and Kuznetsk miners.
   In Karaganda, strikers said they walked out to protest incomplete
news accounts of miners' demands in the Kuznetsk strikes, according
to Tass.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday the strikes could
imperil his reforms and that there were reports of railway workers
being urged to strike.
   He said that if labor trouble spreads, ``We may have to take such
extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing'' to
overhaul the economy through greater attention to free-market
mechanisms.
   He did not elaborate.
   Strikes are rare in the Soviet Union and were ended by force
before Gorbachev gained power in March 1985.
   Tass today said that the Kuznetsk strike had reached ``a turning
point,'' with nine out of 11 mining centers back at work.
   It was not known how many more employees were back on the job
today. On Wednesday, Tass said that 24,000 strikers in Kuznetsk were
back at work and 150,000 remained on strike.
   State television said Wednesday that the strike in the Donetsk
basin had spread to 70 of its 120 mines, more than triple the
previous number, and that mine construction workers had joined.
   In a report from the Donetsk city of Yenakiyevo, television said
steel and coke-chemical plants were ``on the verge of a stoppage''
for lack of coal.
   Earlier reports in the official press had said operations at
steel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal and
coke.
   Gorbachev told the national legislature Wednesday that the
strikes had deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal.
   The government has agreed to most miner demands, including those
on pensions and overtime, Gorbachev said. But he said that settling
some longer-term issues would take up to a month.
   Tass outlined a concessions package that includes bonus pay to
night shifts and for men using jackhammers.
   Strikers also have complained about poor housing and shortages of
consumer goods and food, and the government has made general pledges
of improvements in those areas.
