    Port Workers, Coal Miners Join Strike To Legalize Solidarity.
   </title>
   <text>
    Port workers in Szczecin and
southwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes with
miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity, opposition
activists said.
   In support of an estimated 3,000 colleagues striking for a
second day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie, workers at the
nearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools and
launched their own occupation strike.
   Port workers occupied the docks in Szezecin, about 250 miles
northwest of Warsaw, and set up a 15-member strike committee, said
Jan Kostecki, a leader of the independent union federation.
   A local prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal,
Solidarity officials said.
   Andrzej Andrzejczak, head of the Morcinek mine strike committee,
said: ``We support all of the demands of the July Manifesto mine
workers.''
   The mine is about 12 miles south of July Manifesto, where
strikers were demanding legalization of the outlawed independent
labor federation, pay raises and reinstatement of workers fired for
trade union activites.
   Police ringing July Manifesto, one of Poland's largest coal
mines, today turned away area residents who tried to bring food to
the strikers.
   Andrzejczak said the Morcinek miners broke off talks with
management when they were refused access to loudspeakers and
contact with the strikers at July Manifesto. He said miners erected
a large Polish flag atop the administration building and were
blocking the complex's main entrance.
   It was not immediately known how many workers were involved.
   The second strike came as Solidarity strike committee members
met with management and representatives of the Industry Ministry at
the July Manifesto colliery.
   Adam Kowalczyk, a regional Solidarity leader, said more workers
were joining colleagues inside by leaping over police barricades.
   The strike committee issued a communique today saying the
workers would not end their stoppage until their demands are met
and charged: ``The mine management is trying to end the strike by
hunger.''
   Police surrounded the mine after workers put down their tools on
Tuesday. Witnesses said about 600 officers were outside and about
3,000 strikers inside.
   The strikes mark the eighth anniversary of the birth of the
Solidarity, which Communist authorities crushed in a 1981 military
crackdown.
   Miners leaving July Manifesto this morning said wage demands
were based on hardships caused by Poland's worsening economy,
including 60 percent inflation.
   ``The economy is in ruins,'' one told The Associated Press.
``Miners cannot live on their salaries because of recent price
hikes.''
   Miners earn nearly twice the average national salary and receive
extra benefits because of the vital role they play in the economy.
Poland is the world's fourth largest exporter of coal, and coal is
the nation's leading export.
   July Manifesto, a hotbed of labor activism during the strike
wave that spawned Solidarity, is one of five coal mines in the
region.
   Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said there were no reports of
violence and police made no attempt to move into the mine, which is
280 miles southwest of Warsaw and employs about 9,000 workers.
   The state-run PAP news agency, in a dispatch late Tuesday, said
the strike was illegal. PAP said the miners were warned that ``they
may be held responsible for their illegal actions.''
   The July Manifesto mine is in Silesia, Poland's industrial
heartland.
   Eight years ago, a wave of mine strikes in Silesia ended with
the signing at July Manifesto of the last of three agreements that
established Solidarity across the nation. The pact also won
work-free weekends.
   Solidarity leaders said the strike began Tuesday when overnight
shift workers refused to take up their tools. They were joined by
workers arriving for the morning shift, Kuron said.
   Kuron said mine management then locked out members of the
afternoon shift to prevent them from joining the strike.
   Solidarity spokesmen said workers at the nearby Borynia mine
staged a brief sympathy rally but went back to work Tuesday
afternoon.
   Also Tuesday, security officials briefly detained 10 Solidarity
activists at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw in
lower Silesia.
   That mine has also been the scene of unrest in recent months,
where workers have demanded improved safety conditions.
   Five strikes in Poland from April 25 to May 10, and brief
stoppages or strike threats in 25 more work places, constituted the
worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-law
crackdown. One of the stoppages, at a steel mill near Krakow, was
broken up by security forces.
   The workers in those strikes also demanded the legalization of
Solidarity, along with wage increases.
