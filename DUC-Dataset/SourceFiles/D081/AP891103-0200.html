    Soviet Miners Block Coal Shipments.

    Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta region
are expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments,
the Soviet news media reported Friday.
   The miners are demanding the government fulfill promises of
improved living and job conditions.
   Soviet officials have said the strikes could force fuel
rationing during the Soviet Union's severe winter.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov introduced a bill in parliament that
would increase pension benefits by about 40 percent and upgrade
benefits for coal miners, the official Tass news agency reported.
   The Komsomolskaya Pravda youth newspaper, in an article giving a
sympathetic view of the workers condition's in the Arctic Cirle
coal-mining districts, said many miners do not see daylight for
months because of their underground work and the sun dips below the
horizon in the winter.
   A regional court in Vorkuta ruled that the latest round of
strikes is illegal but did not impose any penalties. The miners's
unions said the decision will be appealed.
   Coal miners in the northern region and the Ukraine struck for
two weeks this summer but returned to work in July after parliament
passed a resolution promising reforms, including improved social
and economic conditions. The miners say the government has renedged
on its promises.
   The news media gave these accounts of the latest strikes:
   Workers at the Vorgashor mine in the Arctic Circle, the largest
mine in the Vorkuta region, continued their strike for an eighth
day, according to Tass.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said night-shift workers walked out at
three mines in Vorkuta and at another one the miners were still
working but were preventing the coal from being shipped outside the
region.
   In the Ukraine's Donetsk Coal Basin, the nation's major
coal-producing area, miner representatives were discussing another
strike. Tens of thousands of miners walked off the job for two
hours Wednesday.
   Tass said that in Donetsk the miners gathered in front of the
House of Unions to demand that the government set a deadline for
implementing reforms.
