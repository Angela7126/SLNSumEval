    Romanian coal miners flex their muscles.

    COALMINERS from Romania's Jiu Valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform
rampages through Bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike,
pressing the government for higher wages.
But so far the government, unlike its predecessors, has not caved in. It has
instead begun legal action to have the strike, which today entered its
second week, declared illegal.
The miners' position seems untenable. Romanians appear solidly opposed to
the strike, angered by the miners' demands for an average wage of the
equivalent of Dollars 290 a month. Most workers earn less than Dollars 80.
Workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored
appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity.
The Ministry of Industry argues that the 6m tonnes of pit coal produced each
year in the Jiu Valley's 13 mines is not a vital source of energy. The
region's coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants, which
together account for only 4 per cent of the country's electricity capacity,
could also be run using lignite and gas.
The ministry further argues that the miners are in danger of pricing their
coal out of the market. According to the ministry, if the miners' pay
demands were met, the cost of their coal would double. Even at present
prices, Ukrainian coal is being imported to the Romanian market.
The strike seems motivated by a number of factors. The rank and file have
come out because they want more money to compensate for the difficult
conditions in which they live and work.
They are also following the call of their charismatic leader, Mr Miron
Cosma, the man who led them on protests to Bucharest and secured their
earlier wage increases.
Mr Cosma's motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, he has
the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.
The ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations into
charges of fraud and embezzlement by Mr Cosma and several senior RAH company
officials. The company's chief accountant and budget director have already
been fired, following earlier investigations.
Ministry of Industry officials argue the strike could be an attempt to
divert attention from the investigations.
Mr Cosma, however, appears confident. One of his bargaining tools is the
threat, albeit veiled, of fresh violence.
In response to the question as to whether he intends to lead his men, who
appear to support him whole-heartedly, to Bucharest again, he says: 'With
miners, anything is possible.'
But he is also making political threats. In recent months, Mr Cosma has
claimed he has evidence that senior government officials, including
President Ion Iliescu, called miners to Bucharest as part of plans to
consolidate their own power.
Mr Cosma appears increasingly willing to talk if his demands are not met. It
remains to be seen whether those involved in the incidents of 1990 and 1991
now feel confident enough to ignore him.
