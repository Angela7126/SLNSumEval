    71-Year-Old Conductor Cancels Performances, Cites Exhaustion.

    Conductor Leonard Bernstein has canceled several
performances in Japan due to exhaustion and lingering illness and
will return to the United States to recover, his manager announced
today.
   ``Leonard Bernstein is suffering from exhaustion as a result of
trying to fulfill his professional obligations while not having
fully recovered from several ailments he suffered this spring.
Complete rest for an extended period is required if this remarkable
man is to regain his usual high energy level,'' said Dr. Kevin
Cahill, the conductor's personal physician.
   Bernstein, 71, has suffered from severe influenza, pleurisy, and
pneumonia since the beginning of the year, Cahill said in a
statement released by Harry Kraut, Bernstein's manager.
   Dr. Angelo Aquista, an associate of Cahill, flew to Japan to
accompany the conductor back to New York, it said. Kraut did not
provide the time or date of Bernstein's departure.
   Bernstein had been scheduled to conduct the London Symphony
Orchestra in four performances in Japan, ending with a concert on
July 22.
   Bernstein issued a separate statement apologizing to his fans
and sponsors and saying that he had asked LSO principal conductor
Michael Tilson Thomas and Japanese conductor Eiji Oue to fulfill
his conducting responsibilities.
   On Saturday and Sunday, Bernstein canceled appearances with an
orchestra of young musicians from the Pacific-Asia region who had
been training under principals of the LSO during the three-week
Pacific Music Festival in northern Japan.
   Bernstein inaugurated the festival last month. He started the
event along the lines of the Tanglewood music festival in
Massachusetts, where young musicians train with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.
   The Japan festival is believed to be the first festival in Asia
where young musicians can train with a professional orchestra.
   Kraut's statement said it was not known whether Bernstein would
be able to conduct next month at the Tanglewood festival or during
the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra Tour in Europe later this
summer.
