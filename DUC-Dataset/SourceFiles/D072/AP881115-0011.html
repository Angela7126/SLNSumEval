    Bernstein Celebrates 45th Conducting Anniversary.
   </title>
   <text>
    Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th birthday in August
was marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to Carnegie Hall with
the New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his triumphant
conducting debut there with the orchestra.
   And of course, Monday night's program consisted of three
Bernstein compositions that were played shimmeringly well. As well
it should: It was the 1,215th time Bernstein conducted the orchestra.
   On Nov. 14, 1943, Bernstein, the Philharmonic's then-assistant
conductor, filled for an ailing Bruno Walter on such short notice
there was no rehearsal. The concert was broadcast nationally on
radio. And there was such acclaim that Bernstein, who had never led
the orchestra in concert until that day, was catapulted to fame, at
age 25.
   At intermission, Mrs. Artur Rodzinski, whose late husband was the
Philharmonic music's director in 1943 and hired Bernstein as his
assistant, was introduced from a box.
   Violinist Jacques Margolies, who played in the Philharmonic that
Sunday, is still a member and was playing on Monday night. Eight
others who also were members in 1943 _ violinist Louis Fishzohn,
oboist Albert Goltzer, timpanist Saul Goodman, bassist Homer Mensch,
cellist Martin Ormandy, assistant concertmaster Michael Rosenker,
and trumpeters James Smith and William Vacchiano _ went on stage.
   Bernstein gave bear hugs to all nine.
   ``I feel older than all of them,'' said Bernstein.
   Bernstein was given a silver box engraved with a reproduction of
Monday evening's program cover _ a caricature of him, with jutting
chin, bright eye, flowing hair and baton, and reading ``with love
and thanks of the Philharmonic family to Lennie.''
   ``Will this birthday never end?,'' he told the audience.
   Monday's concert began with Bernstein's ``Chichester Psalms,''
with the splendid Westminster Symphonic Choir. Todd Caruso, a member
of the American Boychoir whose voice is high, pure and moving, sang
the solo part.
   Violinist Gidon Kremer, a native of the Latvian town of Riga in
the Soviet Union, was soloist in ``Serenade for Violin, String
Orchestra, Harp and Percussion.'' Kremer's sound isn't warm but his
technique is breathtaking.
   Pianist Krystian Zimerman, who was born in Zabrze, Poland, often
performs with Bernstein in Europe. He was the respectful and
thoroughly engaged soloist in the final work on the program,
Bernstein's ``Symphony No. 2 for Piano and Orchestra,'' subtitled
``The Age of Anxiety'' after W.H. Auden's poem.
   All the performers donated their services, with proceeds
benefiting the Philharmonic's efforts on behalf of American
conductors.
