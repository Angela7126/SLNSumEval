    Leonard Bernstein Giving Up Conducting.
   </title>
   <text>
    Conductor Leonard Bernstein, the ``West Side
Story'' composer who mesmerized audiences with his passion and
physical flair at the podium, is giving up the baton because of
poor health.
   The 72-year-old maestro suffers from a lung tumor, emphysema and
pulmonary infections and has been told by his doctor to stop
conducting and performing on the piano, his spokeswoman said
Tuesday.
   ``Leonard Bernstein will henceforth devote his professional
energies to composing, writing and education,'' said Margaret
Carson.
   He last conducted Aug. 19 at the Tanglewood Music Center in
western Massachusetts.
   Bernstein's announcement was met with dismay in the music world,
especially at the New York Philharmonic, which he directed from
1958 to 1969. ``I receive this unfortunate news in utter shock,''
said Zubin Mehta, music director.
   Albert K. Webster, managing director of the Philharmonic, said:
``Leonard Bernstein has BEEN the New York Philharmonic for more
than 45 years. We all will be less for the loss of his magic
baton.''
   Bernstein still hopes to participate in an AIDS benefit at
Carnegie Hall on Oct. 28 but canceled all appearances with
orchestras in New York, Israel, Vienna and London and with festival
orchestras at Tanglewood, Germany and Japan.
   Bernstein, known for his vigorous style at the podium, once led
an orchestra performance at a liberated concentration camp. Last
Christmas, he celebrated the tumbling of the Berlin Wall by
conducting Beethoven's ``Ninth Symphony.''
   In May, he canceled plans to conduct opening night of the
Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., citing ``a near brush with
pneumonia.''
   Carson said Bernstein has had increased difficulty breathing in
past weeks. Dr. Kevin M. Cahill attributed the problem to emphysema
complicated by a tumor and pulmonary infections. Bernstein was once
a heavy smoker.
   Bernstein is not hospitalized. Carson said the conductor was
told that rest offers the best hope for returning to limited
activities.
   She said Bernstein plans to continue work on a new chamber music
piece to be performed next spring, a new musical theater work he
hopes to finish by summer and several educational, film and
recording projects, as well as his memoirs.
   Bernstein was the wunderkind of American music at a time when
all respected conductors in the United States were born and trained
in Europe.
   His first published composition was ``The Clarinet Sonata'' in
1942. He conducted his first symphony, the ``Jeremiah,'' with the
Pittsburgh Symphony in 1944. That year his ballet, ``Fancy Free,''
choreographed by Jerome Robbins, opened and became the basis for
the Broadway musical ``On the Town.''
   After Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor Serge Koussevitzky
died in 1951, Bernstein became head of the orchestra and conducting
departments at Tanglewood. His first opera, ``Trouble in Tahiti,''
was performed in 1952. He composed ``Candide'' in 1956 and ``West
Side Story'' in 1957.
   In 1969, he retired from the post to concentrate on composing
and was appointed the Philharmonic's laureate conductor for life.
He has conducted 1,244 New York Philharmonic concerts, more than
any other conductor.
