    Panel: Honecker Unfit to be Held but Fit to be Tried.

    East Germany's deposed Communist leader Erich
Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be
tried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.
   ADN, quoting a Health Ministry statement, said Honecker was
still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in January and was
not well enough to be incarcerated.
   But a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in condition
to be questioned and to stand trial, ADN said.
   Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was
ousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept
the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist
government and the opening of the Berlin Wall.
   The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist
officials, who had been among Honecker's closest aides, were all
fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.
   It said former secret police chief Erich Mielke, former
economics czar Guenter Mittag and former labor chief Harry Tisch
were under arrest, while the other four remained free. All three
had been members of the ruling Politburo under Honecker. Mielke was
arrested on Thursday.
   Honecker and the seven are charged with corruption and abuse of
office. They had been arrested soon after Honecker's fall but were
later released because of advanced age and poor health.
   Honecker has been staying at a Soviet military hospital outside
East Berlin.
   ADN quoted Federal Prosecutor Guenter Seidel as saying he
intended to continue his investigation against the former East
German leaders, although their poor health often disrupted the
proceedings.
