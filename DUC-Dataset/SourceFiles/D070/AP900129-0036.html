    Honecker Arrested, Taken to Prison.

    Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who
is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday
morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the
official news agency ADN said.
   The news agency said the 77-year-old Honecker was arrested after
being released from East Berlin's Charite hospital, where he had
undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.
   Honecker was immediately taken to East Berlin's Rummelsburg
prison, the brief dispatch said. Honecker joins other members of
his ousted Politburo already in prison awaiting trial.
   Earlier this month, East German prosecutors said Honecker and
former state security chief Erich Mielke would be charged with
treason and corruption charges for misuse of their positions and
state funds.
   Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East
Germany for 18 years until his ouster on Oct. 18, had previously
been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.
   ADN said that the director of Charite urology clinic, Dr. Peter
Althaus, repeated on Monday that in his opinion Honecker was still
not well enough to be jailed.
   On Sunday, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper said
Honecker would be arrested, but that he would be held at a prison
hospital because of his condition. ADN made not mention if
Rummelsburg prison was equipped with a medical facility.
   Earlier this month, East Germany's Luthern Church had offered to
put Honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the
hospital.
