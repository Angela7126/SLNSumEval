    Moscow News Paints Sympathetic Portrait of the Sakharovs at Home.

    A Soviet newspaper has painted a highly
sympathetic portrait of Andrei D. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner,
countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as
traitors by the state-run media.
   But the account in Moscow News only indirectly mentioned the
nearly seven years Sakharov spent in forced internal exile for
criticizing the Soviet drive into Afghanistan, indicating that
topic is still too sensitive.
   In its latest issue, the weekly devoted its entire back page to
describing the home life of Sakharov, 66, the 1975 Nobel Peace
Prize winner, and said the words most often heard in his
seventh-floor Moscow apartment are ``help me.''
   Sakharov's apartment on a major thoroughfare has been a mecca
for Soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed to
return from exile in the closed city of Gorky in December 1986.
   Since then, Sakharov, who was one of the creators of his
nation's hydrogen bomb, has vocally supported Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reform campaign, but has called for the liberation
of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of
human rights.
   Past Soviet reports, published before Gorbachev became Soviet
leader, accused Bonner of marrying Sakharov for his money and said
the couple lived in ``oriental luxury'' amid ``scandals between
spouses.''
   Moscow News depicted the couple as living peacefully and
frugally, eating cabbage, beet soup, potatoes, and other simple
fare, and marveled that Sakharov, a member of the prestigious
Academy of Sciences, always does the dishes himself.
   While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the
author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and
scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News
said.
   ``Sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed
that he write an apology for all the lies that were published,''
the paper said.
   It reported that when the unidentified author refused, Sakharov
said, ``It's too bad that duels are abolished in our times,'' and
slapped him.
   Sakharov has been quoted numerous times by Soviet media since
his return from exile, but the article in Moscow News was the
longest devoted to him so far.
   But most of the newspaper's circulation is among foreign
tourists and readers abroad, so relatively few Soviets would see
the Sakharov article. As well as appearing in Russian, Moscow News
also prints editions in English, French and other languages.
