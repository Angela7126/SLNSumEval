    Sakharov Challenges Science Academy Legislative Slate.
   </title>
   <text>
    Andrei D. Sakharov urged members of the Academy of
Sciences on Monday to reject the leadership's list of candidates for
the new Soviet legislature, which does not include the Nobel Peace
Prize winner.
   The 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, who
won the Nobel in 1975, said in a speech to the academy that many
scientists objected to the slate for Sunday's election approved by
the leadership in January.
   Sakharov and several other well-known proponents of reform are
missing from the list. The official news agency Tass quoted him as
saying, however, that scientists were upset ``not because Sakharov
was not nominated, but because the role of scientific institutions
was ignored.''
   He called for reversal of what he called the anti-democratic
decision, which produced a list of what critics describe as
old-guard managers of scientific institutions.
   A vote on the academy candidates is scheduled for Tuesday.
   Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a
seat in the new 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, but he
decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy of
Sciences seat.
   Under an election law approved in December, 750 seats in the
legislature are reserved for the Communist Party and its affiliates
and for professional, social and trade union organizations. The
other 1,500 will be filled by representatives of the 15 Soviet
republics and their electoral districts.
   Those in the academy who support Sakharov hope to force a new
round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all
nominees a majority, said Andrei Mironov, a former political
prisoner.
   That would force the academy to start over and produce a new list
of nominees under terms of the new election law.
   Twenty-five seats were allotted to the academy, but it gave five
to affiliated societies and associations. From 121 nominees, the
academy leadership chose 23 candidates for the remaining 20 seats.
   Although 60 research institutes nominated Sakharov, he was not
chosen for the final slate. The leadership's decision inspired
widespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academy's
Moscow headquarters.
   Tass said 1,108 academicians, corresponding members and
representatives of reseach institutes attended the three-day meeting
that began Monday.
   ``The first three days of this week may become the `hottest'
spring days for Soviet scientists,'' it said, alluding to the
leadership's rejection of such reformers as Sakharov, space
scientist Roald Sagdeev and sociologist Tatyana Zaslavsakaya.
   The agency acknowledged ``many scientists were unsatisfied'' with
the slate of candidates.
   Mironov said two other academicians also spoke on Monday in favor
of new nominations. No details of their remarks were available.
