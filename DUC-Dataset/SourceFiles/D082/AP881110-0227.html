    Andrei D. Sakharov, the father of the Soviet
dissident movement, finally received a 1973 human rights award
Thursday night during his first trip to New York City.
   Sakharov received the Human Rights Award from the International
League for Human Rights at a reception at the home of Ronald Lauder,
the former U.S. ambassador to Austria.
   The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is on his first trip to
the West, less than two years after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
freed him from internal exile in the city of Gorky. The human rights
activist was banished in 1980 to the closed city for opposing the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
   About 200 guests, including author Elie Wiesel, Brooklyn District
Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, designer Caroline Roehm and ABC
television's Barbara Walters, attended the reception.
   The ceremony was closed to the media. Sakharov, wearing a blue
beret and plaid scarf, made no statement as he left the reception
and entered a waiting limousine.
   Sakharov is the honorary president of the league, which has its
headquarters in the United States and more than 40 affiliate groups
around the world, including the Moscow Human Rights Committee, which
Sakharov and his colleagues founded in 1971.
   Sakharov arrived in the United States on Sunday to visit
relatives and receive medical treatment before going to Washington
for a White House visit and a board meeting of the International
Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, of which he
is a director.
