    Sakharov's Trip Largely Ignored by Soviet Media.

    The visit by human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state
media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition
to the U.S. ``Star Wars'' program.
   That report from Radio Moscow, carried on its
international-service news programs Tuesday, apparently was the only
mention made by Soviet media of Sakharov's visit to the United
States, which began Sunday.
   Radio Moscow said Sakharov made the comments about the Reagan
administration's space-based anti-missile program at a Boston news
conference.
   Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, is scheduled to
spend two weeks visiting relatives in the United States, undergoing
medical tests and promoting a new international organization he
belongs to.
   A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissident
movement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal
exile after criticizing the Kremlin's military drive into
Afghanistan.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow in
December 1986. Some statements and articles by Sakharov have been
printed in the Soviet media since then, including an article last
week in a magazine that opposed some elements of Gorbachev's
blueprint for political and electoral reforms.
   Other activities by Sakharov have gone unreported here, including
his delivery to Gorbachev of a list of 200 Soviets reportedly held
in prison, labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of their
political views.
   The official Tass news agency reported Wednesday that the
organization Sakharov belongs to _ the International Foundation for
the Survival and Development of Humanity _ held its first session in
Boston the previous day.
   Tass made no mention of Sakharov in its three-paragragh report,
but said the Soviet delegation to the meeting was headed by Yevgeny
Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
