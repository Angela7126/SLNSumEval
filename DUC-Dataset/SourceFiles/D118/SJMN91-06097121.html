    Former Sen. John Tower of Texas and his daughter were among 23 people killed
Friday when the twin-engine commuter plane they were aboard crashed while
trying to land.;    Astronaut Manley Lanier "Sonny" Carter Jr., who flew on a
1989 space shuttle mission and was in training for a shuttle trip later this
year, also died in the crash.

    Another victim was Dr. Nicholas Davies, president-elect of the American
College of Physicians, a 60,000-member industry group, said Dr. Louis Felder,
who worked with Davies at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. None of the 20
passengers or three crew members aboard Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight
2311 survived.;    The crash followed by one day the plane-helicopter
collision that killed Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania and six other people.;  
 Tower, 65, and his daughter Marian, 35, boarded the 30-passenger, turboprop
Embraer 120 in Atlanta and were headed to Sea Island, off the Georgia coast,
for a party in Tower's honor.;    Officials said they did not know the cause
of the crash. The plane was descending in clear weather, authorities said,
when it went down at 2:47 p.m. about three miles northeast of the runway at
the Brunswick-Glynco Jetport.;    Witnesses said the plane appeared to have
fallen straight from the sky.;    "It just went straight down. There was no
cropping of trees," said Lt. Jack Hopper of the Glynn County Police
Department, quoting witnesses.;    "It started in on its nose, and I knew it
was in trouble," said James Griner, who lives a quarter-mile from the airport.
"I went to the plane, but I couldn't get to it because of the fire. ... When
I got to it, it looked compacted.";    Atlantic Southeast's senior vice
president, John Beiser, said officials had no indication from the pilot that
the flight was in trouble.;    Donald Day, the airline's manager of consumer
affairs, described the aircraft as "extremely sophisticated and
fuel-efficient, one of the backbones of our commuter fleet." He said the plane
was new and had been put in service in December.;    The Brazilian-made
Embraer 120 is manufactured by Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA. In 1984,
an Embraer 110 Bandeirante, an earlier model of the 120, crashed in
Jacksonville, Fla., killing 13 people. The Federal Aviation Administration
subsequently ordered an inspection of all Embraers for possible sheared or
worn rivets in the tail sections.;    Tower's death prompted words of grief
and praise among his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, even those who helped
derail his elevation to the Cabinet in 1989.;    "I'm deeply saddened by the
loss of John Tower, a tough, able friend and patriot," said Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, who broke ranks with most Democrats to support President
Bush's nomination of the 24-year Senate veteran to be defense secretary. "He
was intelligent and had independence of judgment.";    Senate Armed Services
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who led the successful fight against
Tower's confirmation, said: "America had lost a patriot. ... He fought for
freedom and worked diligently to make the world more secure.";    "It's so
sad," Bush said. "It is a tragic loss."
