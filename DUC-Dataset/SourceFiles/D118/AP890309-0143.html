    Senate Votes Down Tower.
   </title>
   <text>
    The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected
the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary,
delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his
term.
   The Senate's 53-47 vote came after a bitter and divisive debate
focused on Tower's drinking habits, behavior toward women and his
business dealings with defense contractors.
   It was only the ninth time in 200 years that the Senate has voted
to reject a president's Cabinet choice and the only time it has done
so early in a new administration.
   Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the Senate during the
roll call, underscoring Bush's commitment to the nominee. The Senate
galleries were packed and virtually all senators were in their seats
as the roll was called.
   ``The nomination of John Tower to be secretary of defense is not
confirmed,'' Quayle intoned after the vote.
   Kansas GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of
the final hours of debate when she became the sole Republican to
declare her opposition. She said her ``most serious concerns'' were
over Tower's activities as a defense consultant after serving as an
arms control negotiator. She also expressed doubts that he would pay
enough attention to ensuring fairness for women in the military.
   Tower's Republican defenders began to speak of him in the past
tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat, even before
the roll was called.
   ``Just moments ago I took a call from John Tower,'' said Sen.
John Warner of Virginia, the senior GOP member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
   ``His head is high, his voice is strong,'' Warner said. ``He
asked me to convey thanks _ in his words _ to the troops who rallied
to his support.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, moved to repair
damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the Senate
and President Bush.
   ``I know what's in my heart and in my mind,'' he told reporters.
``I want to directly, clearly and unambiguously say that this
doesn't represent an effort to be harmful to the president.''
   Dole agreed to a late-afternoon vote on the nomination after
acknowledging the collapse of a last-minute bid to give Tower an
extraordinary six-month trial period as defense secretary to prove
he could abstain from drinking.
   There was no doubt about the outcome as the Senate went through
the motions of debating the nomination through the final hours
before the roll call.
   The last few undecided senators declared their positions. Sen.
John B. Breaux, D-La., said he would vote against Tower. Sen. James
M. Jeffords, R-Vt., said he would support the nomination.
   Senators from both parties credited Tower's defeat to the
decision to oppose him made by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee.
   ``When he made his decision all the other Democrats wheeled in
behind him,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
   With the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable, White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``If necessary, we'll come up
with a (new) candidate very rapidly.''
   Names most frequently mentioned in White House speculation as a
replacement for Tower if his nomination failed are Sen. Warner, a
former secretary of the Navy; former Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld; former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala.; and national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Scowcroft replied ``No'' when asked this morning if he was in
line for the Pentagon job.
   ``It must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and
the national security adviser, any number of congressmen and
senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on
the tip of their tongue,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``But the time has not come,'' he added. ``The time will come as
soon as the vote is completed. We will wait until then.''
   The most recent Associated Press survey showed 52 Democrats and
one Republican committed to vote against Tower or leaning strongly
in that direction. It showed 41 Republicans and three Democrats
declared for Tower or leaning his way.
   Nevertheless, the White House said it wanted to see the
nomination go all the way to a vote.
   Tower, meanwhile, reported for work at the Pentagon where he and
his three daughters had coffee together. He then continued a review
of various administration proposals.
   ``I hope and believe we can work together on important matters,''
Mitchell said. ``The tension of this issue will have no long-lasting
effect on the relationship. I want to say from the bottom of my
heart that I hope this will be the case.''
   The already slim chance Tower would be confirmed was dealt a
crushing blow on Wednesday as a parade of previously undecided
Democratic senators announced they would vote ``no.''
   Only Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said he would vote ``yes,''
joining just two other Democrats who have made that decision.
   Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va., Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., J. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
all said they would vote against Tower.
   Johnston said his reading of the FBI report on Tower leaves him
with the clear impression that Tower's personality changes when he
drinks heavily, leading to ``a recklessness in the social sense''
entirely different from his behavior when sober.
