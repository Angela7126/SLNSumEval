    Contradictions Cited In Tower Testimony About Defense Firm.
   </title>
   <text>
    Defense Secretary-designate John Tower
contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the Senate his
work for a British firm involved no military matters, according to
reports published Saturday.
   Meanwhile, new questions were raised about the thoroughness of
the FBI's background investigation of the embattled nominee. One
newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents, including
early-morning car crashes and a hotel fire, apparently were
overlooked in the probe.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee has put the nomination of
Tower, a former Texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee,
on hold while it takes a second look at Tower's personal habits,
including his use of alcohol, and his links to defense contractors.
   Tower, who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is
pending, has denied in his Senate testimony any problem with alcohol
or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties.
   A White House spokesman, Stephen Hart, declined on Saturday to
comment on the latest reports, saying ``it's (the nomination) before
the committee.''
   Tower's designated spokesman, attorney Paul Eggers of Dallas, did
not answer a reporter's calls Saturday.
   In written testimony to the Senate panel on Jan. 26, Tower said
he could ``recall no actions in connection with any defense
activities'' in connection with his work for the U.S. subsidiary of
British Aerospace, Inc.
   That statement, according to two publications, The Los Angeles
Times and the Legal Times, did not square with information which
Tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in
June of 1987.
   In the divorce deposition, Tower said he went to work for British
Aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nation's chief
strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell
training jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon,
the Los Angeles Times reported.
   Tower told the Senate committee he worked chiefly on selling
commercial aircraft to U.S. airlines and also advised the firm on
trade legislation and currency fluctuations. He said he earned
$265,000 from the company between June of 1986 and last December.
   The Legal Times said Tower told the divorce attorneys that he was
retained by British Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons
systems to the Pentagon, and that he listed the various weapons
involved. The deposition was never filed in court because Tower did
not contest the divorce, but a copy was obtained by the FBI, the
Legal Times said. It said its reporters were allowed by attorneys to
read it with the understanding that it not be quoted directly.
   The New York Post reported Saturday that the FBI apparently has
not bothered to talk to Tower's neighbors, examine certain police
records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower.
   The Post, citing syndicated columnist Cody Shearer, said the
incidents included an early-morning episode on June 6, 1967, when
Tower was trapped in his hotel suite in Dallas by a blaze he
accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair.
   When firemen broke into his room to remove him, ``he was
reportedly in no condition to free himself,'' the Post said.
   The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car in two
early-morning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970, and,
two years earlier, he drove into a bicycle ridden by James Patrick
Montoya, son of the late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way
home from work. The youth was not seriously hurt.
   FBI spokesman Bill Carter refused comment on specifics of the
Tower investigation, but said ``We will follow any lead.''
   On Friday, Tower authorized the release of a statement that
recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse, and Vice
President Dan Quayle said, ``I have never seen drinking being a
factor in John Tower's life other than a social glass of wine.''
   Eggers, meanwhile, acknowledged that there was ``no question''
that Tower sometimes drank too much in the early 1970s, but he said:
``He is not an alcoholic. He's not had a drinking problem for
years.''
