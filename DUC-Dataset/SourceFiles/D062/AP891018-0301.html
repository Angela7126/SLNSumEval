    Many Homeowners Not Insured; Analysts Say Disaster May Benefit Insurers.

    Most San Francisco-area homeowners may
have to pay for damage from Tuesday's earthquake out of their own
pockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from
higher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday.
   Only 15 percent to 20 percent of California homeowners have
earthquake insurance, which typically requires a 10 percent
deductible and costs between $200 to $400 a year for a $100,000
home, according to industry spokesmen.
   The Association of California Insurance Cos. in Sacramento said
that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the
homes have earthquake insurance. The organization estimated
residential damages from Tuesday's earthquake at $500 million in
the Bay area, with between $100 million to $150 million insured.
   Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get
reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which is
covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn,
director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss Research
Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill.
   Insurance companies attempted Wednesday to assess the amount of
quake-related damages they're likely to have to pay. In addition to
home damage, the companies likely will get claims for automobile
damage, broken glass, theft and burglary, business interruption due
to electrical outages, water damage and, possibly, workers
compensation.
   Some estimated that insurers might face bills totaling $1
billion or more from the quake. But industry observers said they
don't expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from
quake-related claims.
   ``We don't think any company is going to have problems paying
claims,'' said Elisa Siegal, public affairs manager for the
American Insurance Association, a Washington-based trade group.
   The insurers actually could benefit. Industry analysts predicted
insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates
and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages
and the estimated $4 billion in damages from Hurricane Hugo, which
hammered South Carolina and other parts of the southeastern United
States earlier this month.
   An increase in insurance rates could translate into greater
profitability in the long term, the analysts said.
   ``There's a perception that this could turn the cycle ... that
this could be enough to firm pricing,'' said Gloria L. Vogel, an
analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.
   Despite their predictions for the long run, the analysts warned
that fourth-quarter earnings among insurance companies are likely
to be disappointing.
   ``It's going to be a meaningful loss, perhaps as big as Hugo,''
said Robert Glasspiegel, an analyst with Hartford-based Langen
McAlenney.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, some insurance company stock
rose on Wednesday. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. rose $2.37{ to $59.50
a share; ITT Corp., parent of The Hartford, was up 37{ cents to
$59; and the Travelers Cos. rose $1 to $40.87{.
   Reinsurance companies, which absorb risk from policy writers,
did especially well. General Re Corp. rose $2.75 to $86.50 and
Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. rose $3.12{ to $75.87{.
   In California, earthquake insurance is an emotional and
politically-charged issue. Roughly two-thirds of all insurance
policies written in the United States are sold in California, where
many of the nation's most damaging earthquakes have occurred..
   Under a 1985 California law, insurers are required to offer
earthquake insurance to homebuyers, but homebuyers are not required
to buy the coverage.
   Insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance to
commercial property owners, but the percentage of business property
with the coverage is very high, industry spokesmen said. They
estimated that at least 25 percent, and probably many more,
business properties are insured.
   Because of its high costs, earthquake insurance has become a
target of the controversial Proposition 103 approved by California
voters last year. The proposition calls for a 20 percent rollback
in insurance rates. Insurers and state regulators are battling over
the rates and how they're set.
