    A SPECIAL SESSION, WITH SPEED.
   </title>
   <text>
    <p>
     Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session 
within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last Tuesday's Northern 
California earthquake. With Congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion 
in relief, earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to 
come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as 
possible, and as soon as is practical. Deukmejian should be commended, as well, 
for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake 
victims without getting too tangled up in red tape.
    </p>
    <p>
     The governor is wrong, however, in his campaign to distance himself from the 
California Department of Transportation on the issue of what caused the Nimitz 
Freeway in Oakland to collapse, and what could or should have been done to have 
prevented it. While Deukmejian is not necessarily blaming Caltrans, he seems to 
be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as: "What did you know 
and when did you know it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The governor's answer, which he has been repeating ever since the day of the 
quake, was that no one in Caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an 
earthquake. He was shocked that such a thing would happen. This has the 
earmarks of a preemptive defense against any allegation that California stinted 
on highway reinforcement because transportation funds have been short during 
his administration, possibly because he had opposed a gasoline tax increase.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is keen interest, of course, in why the freeway collapsed, and whether 
something might have been done. The major reason is so that California can 
learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones 
against the next quake. There has been no widespread outcry against the 
governor. While the Department of Transportation and the state Transportation 
Commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway 
funds, the governor also sets general state priorities.
    </p>
    <p>
     The governor complained on Sunday that the highway engineers never came to him 
and told him that bridges or freeways might collapse in an earthquake. But no 
one who has lived in California more than a few months would rule out the 
chance that any bridge or freeway could collapse in the right kind of 
earthquake. California is on the edge of earthquake-related technology, but 
still does not know everything that needs to be known. The state learns more 
from every earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible 
from Tuesday, Oct. 17.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it is also the time to concentrate on helping quake victims through these 
most trying days of their experience -- the period when the emergency response 
is over and people face the dreary details of restoring their life to some kind 
of normality. In the Bay Area, that includes hundreds of thousands of commuters 
who did not suffer personal damage, but face massive obstacles in getting to 
work.
    </p>
    <p>
     The governor and legislative leaders will meet again next Monday to determine 
the timing and agenda of a special session. It almost certainly would include a 
temporary gasoline-tax increase to deal with highway reconstruction and repair 
and possible general revenues for other forms of disaster relief. Existing law 
already gives the governor considerable discretion in diverting reserve funds 
on hand to the Office of Emergency Services for allocation to local 
governments. But the need could well exceed the present reserve. The scope of 
the disaster would seem to justify a temporary surcharge.
    </p>
    <p>
     The governor and Legislature should not wait too long to start the session, 
although they do not yet have precise damage estimates or know just how much 
the federal government will send to California. The Legislature can begin 
organizing its staff and committees now so the appropriate legislation can be 
passed as soon as that information is obtained.
