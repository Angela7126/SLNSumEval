    John Major's Year: Major's blue period - A year on from
success at the polls, the prime minister's popularity has plunged. He still
has a great deal to prove.
   </title>
   <text>
    ONE year ago tomorrow, Mr John Major surprised everyone but himself by
winning the general election. His honeymoon, after a very personal victory,
was short-lived and now he begins the second year of his hard-won term as a
deeply unpopular leader who has everything still to prove.
The past 12 months have been hijacked by internal party differences over
Europe, by the debacle surrounding UK withdrawal from the exchange rates
mechanism of the European Monetary System, and by a continuing, deep
recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional Tory
supporters in business.
Mr Major's anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political
point-scoring over the government's record. While Mr Tony Newton, leader of
the Commons, conceded: 'No one pretends that the last year has been easy,'
he also claimed that much had been achieved. The government's efforts to
secure a framework for long-term prosperity was beginning to pay off.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was joined by 10 frontbench colleagues in
launching a counter-attack, involving a detailed and documented indictment
of Mr Major's failures. He attacked the Tories for building 'a bonfire of
pre-election commitments'.
Tory allegiances in the business world have also been put under immense
pressure, though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as
recession ends. Yesterday Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation
of British Industry, remained cautious but volunteered: 'If I were a betting
man I would say we have the embryo of a recovery.'
Mr Major can take little comfort from the conclusion, widespread among
industrialists, that his greatest achievement in the past year has been
Britain's withdrawal from the ERM - something which he resisted and over
which, in the end, he had no control.
Most industrialists, however, find it hard to criticise Mr Major as an
individual, with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal
qualities and those of his predecessor. He still attracts gratitude for the
election victory, which was seen - despite subsequent problems for the
economy - as the best result for business.
But, unlike the previous No 10 occupant, he is seen as a weak leader, with
little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction.
There is a general perception that, important though Britain's future place
in Europe is, the prime minister has been excessively preoccupied with
community affairs and associated internal party ructions, to the detriment
of the domestic economy.
Many industrialists are pleased that Mr Major is now attempting to reshape
economic strategy in favour of the manufacturing base. But the jury is out
on whether the rhetoric will give way to effective action.
