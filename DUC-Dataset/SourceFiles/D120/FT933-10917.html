    Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A few blunt words.
   </title>
   <text>
    THE revelation that John Major is capable of candid, blunt and salty
language when talking off-the- record to friendly journalists has surprised
some people. It has even been suggested that the recording of the prime
minister's conversation with Michael Brunson, ITN's political editor, in
which Major used a variety of four-, six- and eight-letter words to
communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues, may do him good.
With luck, it is reckoned, Major's image as a leaden-tongued wimp may
undergo correction.
What piffle. Major is a gonner, especially after this week's revolt of the
wooden-tops in the Christchurch by-election, where a Conservative majority
of 23,015 at last year's general election was converted into a 16,427
majority for the Liberal Democrats. Fifteen months too late, the voters of
Christchurch rounded on the Tories with a malignant and squeaky fury.
In reality, all politicians, not just Major, are far more candid and salty
when chatting in private than when speaking in public. In public, they have
to be careful of what they say, so their utterances achieve a horrible
mattness. But in private they relax. Their syntax disappears. Their words
become nonsensical. They swear and joke and shout. It really is a spectacle.
To show you what I mean, I spoke yesterday to John Major and John Smith.
Smith, a Scot, is leader of the Labour Party, though not many people know
that. In the aftermath of Christchurch, where Labour lost its deposit, I
wanted to provoke the two Johns into a spot of real soul-searching.
To guarantee them privacy, I used a signal-scrambler. No one could have
eavesdropped. Their responses were true to form. But I have left out the
swear-words because the new Financial Times Style Guide states that 'the
gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged ... Four-letter
expletives will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review (Arts)
pages.' I can live with that, though why the artsy-fartsies should receive
any dispensation is a puzzle.
First, I tackled Major. I said: 'Did you read, John, what Olivier Blanchard,
Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Franco Modigliani, Paul A Samuelson and
Robert Solow wrote, in just one article, in the FT this week? They were
describing Europe's lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate
arrangements. They did not pull their punches. I bet you went chalk-white.
'So why not walk the plank, John? You are the most unpopular prime minister
since the start of the fourth century. Why invite more punishment? Unfairly
or not, you are drawing the blame for all life's unpleasantnesses, let alone
the cock-ups.'
'Are you sure?' the prime minister replied. 'I mean ... how did it come
about, Michael ... like, Christchurch, y'know - load of ... let me put
it to you - the economy, of course ... I mean, wimpy guy like me. But I'm
not giving in like that, like ...'
On and on it went. Then I rang John Smith. I told him I had been impressed
with his interview with Andrew Marr in The Independent on Thursday, in which
he sharpened up his promise to introduce meaty political reforms (if he ever
gets elected), including a referendum on proportional representation.
I said: 'You are starting to raise your game, John. Many people will have
agreed with your assertion that democracy in Britain is decaying, and that
the Tories must be roasted for their arrogance, incompetence, complacency
and sharp practices - especially their 'centralisation of power and the
elimination of opposition'. But some of your critics still accuse you, John,
of laziness and ineffectualness. What do you say to that?'
'Away, ye thowless jad,' shouted the Labour leader. 'Gie me o'wit an' sense
a life, behint a kist to lie an' sklent. Our Stibble-rig was Rab M'Graen, a
clever, sturdy fellow, but then he was sae fley'd by his showther gae a
keek, an' tumbl'd wi' a wintle. Likewise with political and constitutional
reform, Michael, for by the L - - d, tho' I should beg wi'lyart pow, I'll
laugh, an' sing, an' shake my leg, as lang's I dow]'
After that, I thought of telephoning Wing-Commander Paddy Ashdown, leader of
the Liberal Democrats, to solicit his views on Christchurch. But I couldn't
raise the energy.
