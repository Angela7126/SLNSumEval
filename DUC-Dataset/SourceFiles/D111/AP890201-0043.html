    Argentine Ship Sinks Off Antarctica.

    An Argentine supply ship that ran
aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds,
the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could
leak and damage the environment.
   The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso followed warnings from
the U.S. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic
could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel
aboard the ship were to spill.
   No injuries were reported in the sinking. Tourists aboard and the
crew had been evacuated from the vessel, which was 600 miles south
of Cape Horn, the tip of South America. Salvage efforts had been
hampered by 50 mph winds.
   The double-hulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 p.m., the
government news agency Telam said, citing a navy communique. Telam
did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when
it went down.
   The depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately
known.
   The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline
and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station
near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science
Foundation said in a statement released in Washington.
   The ship ran aground Saturday about two miles from Palmer
Station, a U.S. research facility on the Antarctic Peninsula, the
continent's tip. It sustained a 35-foot-long gash in its hull, and
some of the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking, washing
ashore near Palmer station.
   The fuel killed some krill, a tiny shrimp-like creature that is a
vital part of the Antarctic food chain, and has affected penguins,
sea gulls and giant petrel birds, the National Science Foundation
statement said.
   There were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the
wildlife in the pristine surroundings.
   Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank
that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife,
had stopped.
   ``Scientists are concerned that some research search projects may
already have been affected by the leak,'' a foundation statement
said. It said two Argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive
Thursday or Friday.
   Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
   Telam quoted Argentine navy sources as saying: ``The fuel it
carried, both for itself and the Antarctic stations, was in steel
drums so a spill is practically impossible.''
   The 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground, including 82
passengers and 234 crew members, were rescued by power boats and
taken to Palmer Station.
   The passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to
the South Shetland Islands, from which they were airlifted to the
South American mainland Sunday. But 104 crewmen remain at the
station, said Renerie.
   Because the station is equipped for only 40 people, food has been
rationed to two meals a day, a National Science Foundation statement
said.
