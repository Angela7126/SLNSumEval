    A freighter carrying a cargo of
beer sank in the North Sea today off the Dutch coast and all nine
crew members were rescued from life rafts, a coast guard spokesman
said.
   The ship sank at about 12:45 p.m. in high winds, some 28
nautical miles north of the island of Ameland.
   It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29
miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard
spokesman, who was not identified. There were no casualties, he
said.
   The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview,
identified the ship involved as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra
and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer. He did not give the
ship's origin or destination.
   The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking
in high winds. They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter
from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the
sinking, the official said.
   A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the
scene.
   Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry,
possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes
between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland.
   Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its
vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in
West Germany.
