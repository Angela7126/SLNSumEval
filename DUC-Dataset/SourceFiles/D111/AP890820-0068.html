    Couple Says They Survived More Than Two Months At Sea After Whale
Attack.

    A Florida couple said their pleasure boat
was sunk by whales off Costa Rica and they survived 66 days at sea
by eating raw fish and drinking purified water, the U.S. Coast Guard
reported Sunday.
   William Butler, 60, and Simone Butler, 52, of Miami, were ``weak
but recovering'' at a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being
rescued by a Costa Rican Coast Guard ship Saturday afternoon, said
U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Egbert Vallecillo.
   The survivors told authorities they lost about 50 pounds each
from the ordeal, said Vallecillo, who spoke to the couple by
telephone early Sunday. The U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific Command is
headquartered in Alameda, 10 miles east of San Francisco.
   William Butler told Coast Guard officials their 40-foot pleasure
boat Sibonay was attacked and sunk by ``several'' whales on June 15
about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
   ``They were large, according to Mr. Butler,'' Vallecillo said.
``But he didn't know how many whales.''
   The couple's last radio contact was June 13, when they talked to
their daughter in Miami, the Coast Guard spokesman said.
   Vallecillo said he'd heard of boats running into marine mammals
when there's poor visibility, but isn't sure if there are any
recorded cases of whale aggression.
   ``This happened in the early morning hours'' with good
visibility, he said. ``This is the first (case) I've documented.''
   As the boat was sinking, the couple said, they grabbed fishing
rods and a salt-water purifier and and got into a rubber lifeboat,
where they remained for the next two months, Vallecillo said.
   As the lifeboat drifted slowly eastward over two months, the
Butlers said, they caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and
survived multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft
repair kit.
   Butler told U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times the
couple spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down.
   On Saturday, a Coast Guard ship making its ``fisheries'' patrol
about 30 miles off the coast of Golfito spotted the raft and rescued
the couple.
   They were sailing from Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to
Honolulu, where they planned to vacation, Vallecillo said. Butler is
an experienced sailor, he said.
   Their daughter, Sally Smith, and son, Bill Butler, were flying to
Costa Rica on Sunday evening to be reunited with their parents,
Vallecillo said.
