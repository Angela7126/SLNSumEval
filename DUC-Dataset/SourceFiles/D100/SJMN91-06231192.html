    NIXON, disco, LSD -- it's no surprise, really, that those '70s rejects have
staged comebacks.;   But Yoko Ono? The flaky avant-garde artist whose idea of
music was to scream inside a plastic bag while John Lennon played guitar? The
Evil One who single-handedly killed the Beatles and destroyed her husband's
talent and ambition?

    Who could possibly regard her as anything other than a crackpot and a
public menace?;   Well, let's see: there's party rockers the B52s and cult
singer Lene Lovich -- successful, critically acclaimed musicians who credit
Ono's music as an influence. There's the Whitney Museum of Art, which
exhibited Ono's artwork last year -- one of the 10 museum shows she has had
around the world.;   There's also the American Film Institute, which Ono says
is staging an international tour of her experimental films. And Ono's record
label -- "they want to put out all my songs in a kind of CD box or something,"
Ono says.;   Surprised? So's Ono. She's used to rougher treatment. Acceptance
is a difficult concept for her.;   "I'm used to sort of knocking the door
rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it," Ono
says during a telephone interview.;   She's speaking from the New York office
of Bag One Arts, the company Ono founded to promote Lennon's art and image.;  
Marketing an icon; Since his death in 1980, Ono has steadily kept Lennon
products coming out: the albums "Milk and Honey" and "Menlove Avenue" and the
4-CD boxed set "The John Lennon Collection"; the book "Skywriting by Word of
Mouth," a collection of Lennon's unpublished writings; Lennon's art, which Ono
says was his main interest in his final years; and Lennon-inspired
merchandise, such as a line of John Lennon eyeglasses.;   "I told the fans
that I'm going to do 10 years of it. Every year, hopefully, give a new product
and share it with the fans," Ono says. "Some years, we had two or three
products of John that came out.";   The 10-year promise ended with last year's
year-long celebration of Lennon's 50th birthday. In 1991, Ono says, she has
tried to "relax a little and do my own stuff.";   Ono, 57, has been going into
a recording studio every day to work on the proposed boxed-set of her music.
She continues to produce art and recently had a museum exhibit in Iceland.;  
Ono began her art career as an abstract impressionist, then went avant-garde.
She began doing performance art in the early '60s, long before the form was
legitimized by art critics and government grants.;   A life in two worlds; Ono
declines to put a label on her current works. She says that's for the critics
to decide. "I just like to create," she says.;   Ono still lives in the Dakota
apartment house in New York, the site of Lennon's murder by a crazed fan.;  
On Dec. 8, 1980, the couple was returning home from the recording studio where
they had been remixing "Walking on Thin Ice," one of the songs that would
appear on Ono's most successful album, "Season of Glass." As they approached
the entrance to the building, someone called out "Mr. Lennon?" Lennon turned,
and Mark David Chapman shot him five times with a .38 revolver.;   After
Lennon's death, there was speculation that Ono would leave the United States
forever. She did begin living part-time in Geneva.;   "My theory was that I
would live more and more in Geneva," Ono says. "But it seems like
circumstances are making me come back more and more to New York. This is my
hometown, that's how I feel about it. It's a place where I can work very
well.";   Ono was born in Tokyo -- her name means "Ocean Child" -- and came
with her family to the United States in 1936. Ono lived with her family in San
Francisco and New York until the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor forced them
to return home.;   In 1951, the Onos returned to New York. Yoko married a
Japanese composer when she was 23. The marriage lasted seven years. Ono
married a second time in 1963, to avant-garde artist Tony Cox. The couple had
one child, a daughter named Kyoko. In 1966, Ono and Lennon met. He too was
married and had a child, Julian. Ono and Lennon were married in 1970.;   There
has been much speculation on Ono and Lennon's relationship. Some say she
controlled him. "John was an extremely strong person," Ono says. "There was no
way to dominate him, even if I wanted to.";   Others say Lennon used his
relationship with Ono as an escape from things in his life that he felt were
controlling him -- such as the Beatles.;   In May 1968, when the Beatles came
together at the studio to work on "The Beatles," the two-record set commonly
called "The White Album," Ono was at Lennon's side. The two were inseparable.
According to at least one Beatles biographer, Ono even accompanied Lennon on
trips to the bathroom.;   The relationship between the Beatles -- especially
Lennon and Paul McCartney -- was already strained. Having Ono in the studio,
offering suggestions and backing Lennon up in arguments, didn't help.;  
Still, the group already seemed headed toward a break-up, which finally came
when McCartney sued the other Beatles to resolve an argument over the group's
management. So, no, Ono didn't break up the Beatles. But it's also true that
three of them didn't like her much.;   Life after John; "I think the very fact
that John and I got together hurt them a lot," she says. "It's 50/50. We hurt
them and they hurt us. I can't really say it's a one-sided situation.";   Ono
says she feels no bitterness toward the surviving Beatles.;   "Songwriters in
this world are pretty harmless people," she says. "They're not doing anything
like creating a nuclear bomb or trying to decide whether people should be
killed. They're pretty peaceful people and their songs will hopefully inspire
people. I have a lot of respect for them.";   But how do the Beatles feel
toward Ono these days?;   "It varies," she says. "Sometimes they are friendly,
sometimes they are not ... like all relationships with friends. I think
that's natural.";   Many of the books that have been written about Lennon and
the Beatles, especially Albert Goldman's loathing portrait of Lennon, have
been painful to Ono. But she says she isn't sure about writing her own
version.;   "I was hurt very much, and my son, too, by some of the things that
were written," she says. "They were lies and that's what hurt us.;   "Then
again, when I think of writing my true story ... I could say 'this is the
truth' and write about things somebody did or whatever, but then I think about
their children. If you look at it from the big picture, maybe there was not
such an incredible crime done to me."
