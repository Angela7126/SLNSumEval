    Former Wife of Late Beatle Also Denounces New Lennon Bio.
   </title>
   <text>
    Cynthia Lennon joins the throng denouncing the
new, unauthorized biography of her late former husband, John
Lennon, as written by a money-hungry author capitalizing on
untruths.
   ``People who write books like this, it is for greed, and as far
as I'm concerned, they're gravediggers, no more, no less,'' Mrs.
Lennon says on the CBS show ``60 Minutes'' scheduled for broadcast
Sunday evening.
   ``Grave robbers, body snatchers, you name it, they are it.''
   The biography by Albert Goldman, ``The Lives of John Lennon,''
depicts the former Beatle as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugs
who raged his way from Liverpool to New York. It was released Sept.
14.
   Goldman, who defends his Lennon book and said it is based on
1,200 interviews, also has written controversial biographies of
comedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley.
   Lennon was murdered outside his Upper West Side home on Dec. 8,
1980, by Mark David Chapman.
   ``All I know and all the people that love John know that we had
our years (and) that nobody, no film, no book will ever complete
what went on in our lives. That's our part of our hearts that has
to stay with us, must not be public,'' Mrs. Lennon said.
   ``I love John. I've always loved John because he was my first
love. But, I mean, I've loved him in different ways. I love his
memory. I loved what he did. I understood his madness, his phases.
I just feel that I understood.''
   The couple divorced a few months before Lennon married Yoko Ono
in 1969.
   Ms. Ono already has trashed the book, calling it ``totally
fiction'' in a nationwide broadcast that coincided with the release
of the book. She too was interviewed on the ``60 Minutes'' show,
entitled ``The Two Mrs. Lennons.''
   ``These people in this book are not us. It's not John and me,''
Ono said in the taped radio broadcast.
   Cynthia and John's son, Julian Lennon, also denounced the book
on the radio taping, calling it ``lies, untruths,'' and adding that
``the whole thing is just sickening.''
   Sean Lennon, the son of Yoko and John who is now 12, added his
voice on the CBS broadcast, rebutting charges that his father was
inattentive to parenting.
   ``I think he did a lot of fathering in the five years that I
knew him,'' Sean says. ``He spent so much time with me not just at
home, but everywhere, you know.''
