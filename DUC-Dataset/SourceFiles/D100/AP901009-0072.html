    Lennon's `Imagine' Broadcast Worldwide on 50th Birthday.
   </title>
   <text>
    The 50th anniversary of John Lennon's birth was
observed with a global celebration today as his peace anthem
``Imagine'' was played for an estimated 1 billion people in 130
nations.
   The song was played shortly after 10 a.m. following a brief
ceremony at the United Nations that featured the ex-Beatle's widow,
Yoko Ono. Marcela Perez de Cuellar, wife of the U.N. secretary
general, also provided a brief introduction. A recorded message
from the slain Beatle was played as well.
   ``In celebration of John's life, let's use our power of
dreaming,'' Ono said. ``Let's dream of trees growing in abundance,
birds flying in clear air, fish swimming in clear water and our
children living in joy.
   ``Let's dream of men and women feeling good together and people
embracing each other regardless of their creed and religion,'' she
said. ``Let's dream of all races praising one another in the
knowledge that the differences are what makes the human race.''
   The U.N. Trusteeship Council Chamber was about one-third full
with a couple of hundred people for the observance and about 150
people watched on television monitors in the visitors' lobby. A
group of 10 teen-agers in blue jeans and T-shirts sat on the floor,
held hands and meditated.
   More than 1,000 radio stations and networks from 50 countries
had signed on for the satellite broadcast by last week. U.S. Armed
Forces television and radio beamed the event to 80-plus countries.
MTV was to broadcast the program in 25 countries, said network
spokeswoman Andrea Smith.
   More than 50 fans gathered at the late Beatle's sidewalk star on
the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles to honor the
singer-songwriter. Some held candles and others carried birthday
balloons.
   Beatles fans gathered in Liverpool today to pay tribute to
Lennon. Civic dignitaries planned to join them at the city's Cavern
Walks shopping precinct - on the ite of the legendary Cavern Club
where the group was discovered.
   In New York, fans planned a tearful pilgrimage to the spot
outside the Dakota apartment building where Lennon was gunned down
almost 10 years ago.
   ``Lennon always symbolized for us somebody who was able to
handle rock and roll with a sense of humor and later, even more
importantly, as someone who cared for the rights of an individual,
human rights in general, and who had the right concept of freedom
and peace,'' said Ondrej Konrad, the editor of Czechoslovakia's
leading popular music publication.
   Jeff Pollack, head of the California-based Pollack Media Group,
proposed the idea to Ono, who gave it the go-ahead. She believes
recent events around the world - in Germany, Eastern Europe and
particularly the Middle East - show the importance of Lennon's
peace message.
   ``When this was discussed, we had no knowledge of what would
happen in Iraq and Kuwait, you know. And now it seems very
appropriate that this be sung all over the world,'' Ono said.
   ``I don't know, the timing is incredible. It's beyond me ...
It's beautiful.''
   ``Imagine'' is Lennon's musical vision of a world free of war
and poverty. Lennon was born Oct. 9, 1940 and helped lead the
Beatles to international stardom, along with co-members Paul
McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
   He fatally gunned down by an obsessed fan outside his Manhattan
apartment building in December 1980.
   The tribute coincides with the release of a four-compact disc
set of 73 songs, including 61 written by Lennon. Also in honor of
Lennon's 50th birthday, McCartney is releasing his live version of
``Birthday.''
