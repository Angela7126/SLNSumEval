    Slain Beatle Portrayed as Reclusive, Anorexic.
   </title>
   <text>
    John Lennon spent much of a three-year span
tucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus position
with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according to
a biography of the slain Beatle.
   An excerpt from the book, ``The Lives of John Lennon'' by
journalist and biographer Albert Goldman, appearing in the Aug. 15
issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering
portrait of both Lennon and his second wife, Yoko Ono.
   The book is scheduled to be published later this month by
William Morrow &amp; Co. Inc.
   Between 1976 and 1979, Goldman writes, Lennon ``could not be
more remote.''
   Apart from a few hours in the morning and evening, including
time spent with his son, Sean, ``Lennon is back here in his room,
alone and silent.''
   The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life
as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as
perfection. The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965,
Goldman writes, ``when some fool described him in print as the `fat
Beatle.' ''
   ``That phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the
wound has never healed.''
   Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless
slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.
   The 719-page biography also details Yoko Ono's $5,000-a-week
heroin habit in 1979. She reportedly snorted the drug.
   According to the book, Lennon also took heroin and consumed a
great deal of LSD.
   ``I must have taken a thousand trips,'' the book quotes Lennon
as saying. ``I just ate it all the time like candy.''
   Goldman spent more than six years researching the book,
interviewing 1,200 friends, relatives and associates of Lennon, who
was murdered eight years ago in New York.
