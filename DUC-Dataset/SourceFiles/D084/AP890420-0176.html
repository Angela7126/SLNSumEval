    The bodies of 47 sailors killed in the gun
explosion on the Iowa arrived in the United States on Thursday as
the Navy tried to figure out what caused the battleship's turret to
blow up.
   None of the guns in the no. 2 turret had been fired before the
explosion instantly killed the seamen, Navy officials said. They
discarded a theory that the blast had been sparked by red-hot
debris left in the gun's breech by earlier rounds.
   The Navy organized a board of inquiry and placed a moratorium on
firing 16-inch guns, found only on the Iowa and its three sister
battleships, the New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.
   The Iowa was headed back to its home port at Norfolk, Va., while
the bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at Dover
Air Force Base in Delaware and families of the battleship's 1,600
crewmen waited to learn whether their relatives were among the dead.
   At the White House, chief of staff John Sununu announced
President Bush will attend a memorial service Monday for the
victims in Norfolk. He said the president had heard of the service
and told his staff ``if it could be fitted in, he wanted to be
there ... wants to be a part.''
   The blast occurred Wednesday morning northeast of Puerto Rico as
the Iowa took part in firing exercises that were part of naval
training.
   A spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet and the ship's former captain
both said the explosion in the No. 2 turret could have been
triggered by red-hot debris from earlier firings in the three-gun
turret.
   But Cmdr. Mark Baker, chief of the Navy's Pentagon press office,
said later that none of the turret's three guns had been fired.
   Only four rounds of 22 scheduled to be fired as part of a
training exercise had been fired, he said, and all had been from
the No. 1 turret, forward of the one that exploded.
   No eyewitnesses survived Wednesday's explosion behind one of the
16-inch guns on the Iowa, one of the largest warships ever.
   Pentagon officials declined to speculate publicly about the
exact cause of the disaster, the worst to strike a Navy ship since
1977, but two officers _ Capt. Paul Hanley, a fleet spokesman, and
Capt. Larry Seaquist, the ship's former captain _ said a possible
explanation was that red-hot debris from a previous round ignited
new charges.
   But Seaquist stressed, ``We simply do not know what caused that
powder to go.''
   Baker said no guns in the No. 2 turret had been fired and the
order had just been given to the No. 2 turret crew to load and
prepare the center gun when the explosion occurred.
   ``We have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired,'' Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters as he headed back to
Washington from a NATO meeting in Brussels.
   The Iowa sailed to Roosevelt Roads Navy Base in Puerto Rico to
unload the bodies, which were then flown to Delaware. Navy
investigators boarded the ship as it left for Norfolk, where it is
expected to arrive Sunday or Monday.
   Navy Secretary William Ball attended a memorial service at the
Delaware base, home of the armed services' largest mortuary. The
flag-draped coffins were carried off a plane by Navy honor guards.
   Around the United States, Navy officers and chaplains broke the
bad news to the dead men's next of kin.
   The job began just before midnight Wednesday, when officials in
Norfolk received the list of the dead.
   ``I've done it many times and I'll never get used to it,'' said
Cmdr. Doug Palmer, acting chaplain for the Norfolk Navy Base. Five
men had families in the Norfolk area.
   The commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet, Adm. Jerome Johnson, who
was on board the Iowa, told reporters in Puerto Rico, ``The fire
and explosion was instantaneous.''
   Cheney indicated the casualties were all in the swiveling gun
house at the top of the turret, rather than the mechanical
compartments and ammunition magazines below it.
   Eleven men escaped from powder magazines deep within the ship at
the base of the turret. A dozen crew members suffered minor
injuries fighting the fire caused by the explosion. They were
treated and returned to duty, said Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman.
   At the White House, President Bush brushed aside suggestions
that the explosion was due to the age of the Iowa, a World War II
leviathan brought out of mothballs during the military buildup of
the Reagan administration.
   Asked about the ship's safety, Bush said he wanted to insure
that procedures were checked ``to be sure that safety is at the
highest point ... but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that
because that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that way
that makes a useful platform obsolete.''
   Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey,
began the board of inquiry's investigation. Hoffman said he could
not predict when the investigation would be completed.
   Seaquist told reporters, ``It seems from the reports that those
powders exploded.'' He referred to the six 110-pound sacks of
powder rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-pound
shell.
   Seaquist said a pressurized air system that clears debris from
the breech at a gun's rear must be operated manually. Each gun has
a one-inch diameter tube carrying air under 3,000 pounds of
pressure to blow debris from the 62-foot barrel.
   The only officer killed was Lt. j.g. Phillip Edward Buch from
Las Cruces, N.M., who would normally be in a small compartment at
the rear of the swivelling top of the turret, adjacent to the room
in which shells are loaded.
   Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion can
occur if a gun breech is cracked, or from a shell that ``cooks
off'' _ ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel or
smoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round.
   ``The first thing that comes to mind is something like a
cook-off,'' said Hanley. ``It could have been a bag or a
projectile. We just don't know yet.''
   None of the four battleships of the Iowa class, which saw
service in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, has ever
sustained such an explosion, Pentagon officials said.
   Wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for the
Navy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died when
a launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton was
struck by a Spanish freighter.
   Except for two World War II Japanese battleships and the current
Navy aircraft carriers, the 58,000-ton ships of the Iowa class are
the largest warships in the world.
