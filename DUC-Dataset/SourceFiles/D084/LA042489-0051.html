    FAMILY, FRIENDS OF CREW WATCH IN SILENCE AS IOWA RETURNS TO PORT.
   </title>
   <text>
    <p>
     The scarred battleship Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where 
about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who 
escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel 
docked at the Norfolk Naval Base's Pier 5. Twenty minutes later, families 
started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning 
sailors.

     The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret, which 
extends six decks down into the ship. There were 11 survivors inside the 
turret, all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ship's 
magazines, the Navy said.

     Crewmen Stand on Turret

     Two of the surviving crewmen of No. 2 turret stood on top of the fire-blackened 
turret as the ship pulled into the pier, with full crews on the ship's two 
other turrets.

     When the vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers among those on the 
dock, but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier.
    </p>

     Adm. Powell F. Carter, commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet, was there to 
greet the vessel. As the ship docked, three Marines raised a flag to half-staff 
at the stern.
    </p>

     The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters 
were not allowed to talk with the families or crewmen.

     The violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur 
videotape released by the Navy on Sunday. The tape was made by an officer on 
the bridge of the Iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns.

     Jet of Intense Fire
    </p>
    <p>
     The detonation, which appears to blast away the gasket-like rubber "bloomers" 
that seal the turret's gun slits, is followed by a jet of intense fire and 
thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
     The videotape cut immediately to damage-control firefighters spraying heavy 
streams of water onto the turret.
    </p>
    <p>
     Churches throughout the area dedicated prayers Sunday morning to the families 
of Iowa crewmen.

     "We have lost 47 of our number in a tragic way," said Cmdr. John L. Fitzgerald, 
a chaplain, in a service at the Norfolk Naval Air Station. "Our faith helps us 
to handle what science cannot answer, the mystery of death."
    </p>
    <p>
     A red rose, a yellow ribbon with the number 47 on it and a book containing the 
names of the dead were taken to the altar.

     This morning, President Bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that 
can accommodate 3,000 people. The families of the victims were invited, but 
Navy officials said they did not know how many would attend.
    </p>

     The explosion occurred during exercises off Puerto Rico. The Pentagon said it 
happened before the middle 16-inch gun of the three-gun turret had been fired. 
The guns, the largest on any ship at sea, use six 110-pound bags of black 
powder to fire a 2,700-pound projectile up to 23 miles.

     Recommissioned by Reagan

     The Iowa and its sister ships, the Missouri, New Jersey and Wisconsin, were 
commissioned during World War II and mothballed after the Korean War. They were 
recommissioned during the Ronald Reagan Administration.

     Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that he believes the four battleships 
still "have merit" as weapons in the U.S. arsenal and have a future in the 
modern Navy. On NBC's "Meet the Press," Cheney called the ships "one way to 
supplement" the usefulness of carrier battle groups "in terms of a show of 
force and showing the flag."
    </p>
    <p>
     "They are effective," he said. "They were relatively cheap to bring back into 
service compared to new ships; they're good cruise missile platforms, so I do 
think they have a role to play. The question is how you do that and how you pay 
for it."
