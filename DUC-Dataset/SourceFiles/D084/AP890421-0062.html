    Critics Call Battleship's 16-Inch Guns Outmoded, Dangerous.
   </title>

    The 16-inch guns on the USS Iowa, which can lob
a shell the weight of a Volkswagen 23 miles, have an outdated
design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age, critics say.
   ``They're old-fashioned and inherently dangerous. They all ought
to be eliminated,'' retired Rear Adm. Eugene LaRocque of the Center
for Defense Information said Thursday. ``I don't know what more it
takes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is no
longer appropriate on warships.''
   But the Navy defended the 16-inch gun, the mightiest in use on
any ocean, after an explosion killed 47 sailors Wednesday aboard
the battleship Iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target
practice.
   ``This gun ... remains the finest naval gun in the world. It was
the pinnacle of gun design art, and it is still a front-line
system,'' said Capt. Larry Seaquist, commander of the Iowa until
last May.
   The main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed
in silk bags to fire 16-inch-diameter shells from its 62-foot-long
barrel. It works like the breech-loaded guns that roared during the
Civil War: A shell is placed into a barrel and then charged with
gunpowder in a separate package.
   In the Iowa's case, 660 pounds of powder _ six 110-pound bags _
is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to 2,700 pounds at a
speed of 2,500 feet per second. An electric spark ignites the
powder.
   The extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during the
burst, but some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases can
build up in the barrel. Air pressurized to 3,000 pounds per square
inch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guard
against a ``blowback,'' which happens when powder ignites before
the breech is closed.
   In newer guns, powder is packed in metal containers. Missiles,
the backbone of the modern Navy's attack capability, have
integrated propellants.
   Capt. James Bush of the Center for Defense Information, a
private think tank often critical of Pentagon policy, said the Iowa
explosion could have been caused by smoldering debris, a blowback
or a mishap in the handling of powder.
   ``It wasn't unexpected. It wasn't a surprise. This is dangerous
technology. It's archaic,'' Bush said. ``These are the only guns in
the Navy that still used bagged powder.''
   The Navy said Thursday that none of the guns in the Iowa turret
had been fired before the explosion took place.
   The Navy also on Thursday placed a moratorium on firing the big
guns, found only on the Iowa and its three sister battleships, the
New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.
   In a larger sense, critics say the battleships themselves, once
the mainstay of gunboat diplomacy, have outlived their purpose.
   Despite 16-inch-thick armor plating, the battlewagons are
vulnerable to submarine and missile attack. The 20-mile range of
the 16-inch guns is almost worthless in an era when missiles can be
fired at much greater distances.
   ``We can do almost anything with a missile and do it better,''
Bush said.
   Battleships reached their heyday in World War I and were
intended to fight other ships.
   The Iowa, first launched in 1942, was the first of an entire
class of U.S. battlewagons built to conquer Japan.
   It supported Marine amphibious landings and shelled shore
targets, but the aircraft carrier emerged as the Navy's top weapon
because naval battles were waged without ships ever seeing each
other. The Iowa also fought off Korea.
   The Iowa and three sister warships were ordered out of mothballs
in the Reagan administration's military buildup six years ago. They
were upgraded with Tomahawk cruise missiles, 20mm guns and Harpoon
missiles.
   One of the battleships, the New Jersey, bombarded Syrian and
Druze positions in Lebanon as part the U.S. peacekeeping role in
1983. But the 16-inch guns often missed their targets, which the
Navy blamed on unreliable powder from World War II.
   ``There was no military need to return these ships to active
duty,'' said the CDI's LaRocque. ``Their only military utility is
to bombard Third World countries, and the era of gunboat diplomacy
is over.''
