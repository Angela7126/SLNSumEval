    Japanese writer Kazuo Ishiguro won the 1989 Booker
Prize, Britain's top literary award, for his novel ``The Remains of
the Day,'' judges announced Thursday.
   The prize is worth $32,000.
   Judges praised the novel, a love story about a butler's English
vacation, as ``a cunningly structured and beautifully paced
performance.''
   Other finalists this year were Canadian Margaret Atwood for
``Cat's Eye,'' Irish author John Banville for ``Book of Evidence,''
Scotland's James Kelman for ``A Disaffection'' and English writers
Sybille Bedford for ``Jigsaw'' and Rose Tremain for ``Restoration.''
   After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salman
Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in
February when he was threatened with death by Moslems who said his
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed their faith.
   ``Now that circumstances have changed, when perhaps it is
inconvenient for many people to support his writing, I just felt it
was fitting that we should not turn our backs on him,'' Ishiguro
said.
   Rushdie lives in England. Ishiguro, 39, arrived in England at
age 6 and now lives in south London. He writes in English.
   In announcing the winner, the judges said: ```The Remains of the
Day' renders with humor and pathos a memorable character and
explores the large, vexed themes of class, tradition and duty. It
was narrowly preferred but universally admired.''
   Ishiguro was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986 for his
novel ``An Artist of the Floating World.''
   The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food
and agriculture business.
