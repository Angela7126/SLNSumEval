    A.S. Byatt Wins Britain's Top Literary Prize.

    Critic and novelist A.S. Byatt on Tuesday won the
Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award, for her
tale of two young scholars investigating the lives of a pair of
imaginary Victorian poets.
   The five judges deliberated two hours before awarding the
$39,000 prize to Antonia Byatt for ``Possession,'' one of six
finalists in the 21-year-old competition.
   Last year's Booker winner was Kazuo Ishiguro for his novel,
``The Remains of the Day.''
   Television executive Sir Denis Forman, chairman of the judge's
panel, announced the prize at a banquet in London's Elizabethan
Guildhall, seat of the city's Lord Mayor.
   ``There was very strong individual support for several books on
the short list and finally `Possession' by A.S. Byatt was the
winner by a majority vote,'' said the judges.
   ``The panel was unanimous, however, in agreeing that the
standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this
made their decision unusually interesting and unusually
difficult.''
   Ms. Byatt, who earlier this month won the $43,000 Irish
Times-Aer Lingus prize for international fiction for the same work,
has published five novels since 1964.
   In ``Possession,'' she tells how two graduate students piece
together the relationship and lives of two imaginary Victorian
poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets'
journeys across England and to France. The influence of the past on
the living is a theme throughout the book.
   Ms. Byatt, born in 1936, is the daughter of a lawyer and sister
of novelist Margaret Drabble.
   Her first novel, ``Shadow of a Sun,'' concerned the efforts of a
woman to escape the shadow of her novelist father. A 1978 work,
``The Virgin in the Garden,'' makes allegorical allusions to
Shakespeare and other English literary geniuses in a tale of a play
performed at a country house.
   Ms. Byatt taught English and American literature at University
College in London until 1983, when she quit to write fulltime.
   Other finalists this year were 1979 Booker Prize winner Penelope
Fitzgerald with ``The Gate of Angels,'' Irish novelist John
McGahern's ``Amongst Women,'' Canadian-born Mordecai Richler's
``Solomon Gursky Was Here,'' Brian Moore's ``Lies of Silence,'' and
Beryl Bainbridge's ``An Awfully Big Adventure.'' They were chosen
from a list of 113 books published in the United Kingdom in 1989.
   The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food
and agriculture business, and administered by The Book Trust. It is
Britain's top literary award.
