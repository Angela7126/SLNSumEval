    Australian Novelist Wins Booker Prize.

    Australian novelist Peter Carey was awarded the
coveted Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday night for his love story,
``Oscar and Lucinda.''
   A panel of five judges unanimously announced the award of the
$26,250 prize after an 80-minute deliberation during a banquet at
London's ancient Guildhall.
   The judges made their selection from 102 books published in
Britain in the past 12 months and which they read in their homes.
   Carey, who lives in Sydney with his wife and son, said in a brief
speech that like the other five finalists he had been asked to
attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won.
   ``If I'd known I was going to win I think I would have taken a
bit more trouble with my handwriting,'' he said as he stared down at
his notes.
   He was unsuccessful in the prize competition in 1985 when his
novel, ``Illywhacker,'' was among the final six.
   Carey called the award a ``great honor'' and he thanked the prize
sponsors for ``provoking so much passionate discussion about
literature _ perhaps there will be more tomorrow.''
   ``Everyone who loves good books benefits from this, surely,'' he
added.
   The winning novel is a fitting choice for Australia's
bicentennial year.
   It tells of a romance between an English gambler and an
Australian heiress who meet on a steamship's maiden voyage to
Australia in the mid-19th century. The story weaves in Australian
history from its founding in 1788 by British immigrants.
   Panel chairman Michael Foot, a writer and former leader of the
opposition Labor Party, said the judges agreed that entries this
year had been ``exceptionally strong'' and that choosing the last
six novels was extremely difficult.
   ``We hope there will be no criticisms but if there are, then
people should start reading the books for themselves,'' Foot said.
   Carey was the only non-Briton in the final six. The son of an
auto dealer, he was born in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, and attended
Geelong Church of England Grammar School, Melbourne, where the
Prince of Wales was also a pupil as an 18-year-old in 1966.
   Carey was an advertising copywriter before turning to writing
books in 1965.
   The first Booker Prize was awarded in 1969. It is administered by
Book Trust, an educational charity promoting books, and is sponsored
by Booker, an international food and farming business.
