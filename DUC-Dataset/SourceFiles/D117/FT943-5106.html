    Booker shortlist fields a 'B-team'.
   </title>
   <text>
    The shortlist of six for the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction,
announced yesterday, immediately prompted the question 'Who?' from many in
the publishing industry.
According to one insider, some on the list 'are B-team writers at best'.
The six include Alan Hollinghurst's The Folding Star (published by Chatto
and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as
a likely candidate from the initial 'long list' of 15, The Reef (Granta) by
young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late
(Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was
almost universally well-reviewed.
As for the other three - Knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical
fable by children's author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) by
Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John
Murray) by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - 'frankly, they
don't make the grade'.
The shortlist for the Booker, the UK's most hyped literary prize and one of
the most lucrative, is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new
fiction fulfilling the criteria - English language and non-American - for
consideration for the award. Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride seems an
astonishing omission, as do new novels by Peter Ackroyd, Peter Carey, Candia
McWilliam, William Trevor and Jim Crace.
But if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be
disappointing, the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife
as ever.
One unsurprising omission from the final selection was When The World Was
Steady, a first novel by Claire Messud, which was on the 'long list' before
it was pointed out that the author was the wife of James Wood, chief
literary reviewer of The Guardian newspaper and a Booker judge.
Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker panel and husband of former
Booker Prize winner Dame Iris Murdoch, expressed surprise at Mr Wood's
failure to reveal his relationship with Ms Messud.
But it is the final list, rather than the controversy, that discredits the
award according to some critics. 'This list,' said one man of letters, 'must
have dealt a final death blow to the Booker.' The winner, selected from an
original 130, will be announced on October 11.
