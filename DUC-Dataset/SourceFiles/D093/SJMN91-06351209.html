    The engineer of a ferry that sank off this Red Sea port, leaving more than 400
people missing, today denied accusations of widespread negligence on the part
of the ship's crew.;   Mahmoud Moharram, engineer of the Salem Express,
acknowledged misconduct by some crew members but said the survival of only
about 10 of the 71-member crew indicated negligence was not widespread.

    Investigators were looking into complaints from some survivors that the
crew abandoned the ferry without helping passengers and that some crew members
pushed aside passengers to get to lifeboats.;   Moharram said he helped 17
passengers put on life jackets. He said the ferry sank quickly Saturday night
after being tossed into a coral reef by stormy seas. Moharram said the coral
cut a hole in the ship's side, and water also entered through the boarding
doors.;   Only seven bodies have been recovered since the ferry went down,
leaving 462 people missing. Today, the deputy security chief for Egypt's ports
said searchers have not given up.;   "We are looking for both survivors and
bodies," said Brig. Gen. Abdel-Karim el-Gazzar. "We haven't lost all hope that
there may be some survivors, although the odds are against it. But you never
can tell.";   Survivors said that after the ferry hit the reef, crew members
herded them to one side of the listing boat, then pushed passengers aside to
get to lifeboats.;   "They went off in a boat," passenger Abdel-A'ati Hassan,
31, said from his hospital bed. "They left us with women and kids, who died.";
  Hassan said the ship sank within 15 minutes of hitting the reef. During that
time, he said, he saw no crew members helping passengers.;   "The crew told us
to stand on one side. They wore life preservers and left us and even pushed us
aside to escape," he said. "They could have had time to help.";   Many
survivors spent hours in shark-infested waters or in lifeboats before being
picked up. Egypt's director of port security, Hassan al-Aghouri, said the
rescue was delayed by the storm.;   At Safaga Central Hospital, Mustafa Ahmed,
38, said he pulled 13 people into a lifeboat.;   "I found a rope and clung to
it, and then I found a capsized lifeboat," Ahmed said. "I managed to get 13
people who were around me in the sea onto the boat. We waited until a ship
rescued us at around noon.";   Prime Minister Atef Sidki, who traveled to
Safaga, said many passengers may have been on lifeboats driven far from the
wreckage by strong winds.;   However, many bodies were expected to be found in
the hull of the ferry. Efforts to lift it began today.;   U.S. Navy helicopter
crews reported "lots of wreckage including life preservers, rafts and floating
material" where the ferry went down. They said the 1,105-ton ferry lay on its
starboard -- or right-hand -- side, with its port side protruding from the
water.;   Lt. Gen. Salah Halaby, chief of staff of Egypt's armed forces, said
30 Egyptian navy divers were searching for victims or, less likely,
survivors.;   The Salem Express sank after a trip from Jiddah, Saudi Arabia,
to Safaga, 290 miles south of Cairo. Many passengers -- all but 10 of the 649
people aboard were Egyptians -- were Muslims returning from pilgrimages to
Mecca, and others were coming home after working in Saudi Arabia.;   Ahmed
Gamal Sobhi, Safaga's city council chairman, said four bodies were recovered
by Egyptian vessels and helicopters by nightfall, and bad weather stopped the
search Sunday.
