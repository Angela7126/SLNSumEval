    A passenger ferry sank off the Caribbean
coast while being towed to port, and 59 people drowned and six are
missing, authorities and news reports said today.
   Capt. Anibal Giron Arreola, a spokesman at the Puerto Barrios
naval base, said the ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II sank Sunday
afternoon in Amatique Bay. He said by telephone that 59 people died.
   Juan Jose Gaytan, a reporter at Radio Portena in Puerto Barrios,
said the Justo Rufineo Barrios II ran out of fuel midway on a
regular 16-mile run from the town Livingston, across the bay, to
Puerto Barrios.
   Gaytan said the boat sank while it was being towed by a tugboat.
   The Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City confirmed the sinking and
said a 40-year-old Spanish citizen, Vicente Daudi, was among the
dead. The embassy reported his wife, Rosa Maria Arnal, and a son
survived the shipwreck, but two daughters were missing.
   Daudi was working with a Spanish technical aid and economic
development mission in Guatemala, the embassy said.
   An official at the Puerto Barrios morgue said 13 bodies have been
identified. Besides Daudi, the nationalities of the victims were not
immediately known.
   Gaytan said navy patrol boats, fishing vessels and private craft
have been searching the bay for survivors and recovering bodies.
   He said he had no other details on the shipwreck.
   Puerto Barrios, 187 miles northeast of the capital, is
Guatemala's principal east coast port.
