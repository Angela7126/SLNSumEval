    American Sailors Recount Harrowing Escape.
   </title>

    Chief Petty Officer Lance Vickery recalls
waves tumbling into the stern of the bobbing ferry headed back to
the USS Saratoga and joking, ``Whoa, looks like we're flooding.''
   Only minutes later, his words came true, turning a simple ride
back from Christmas shore leave into a harrowing fight to survive.
   The Israeli ferry Tuvia capsized shortly after midnight on
Saturday, throwing more than 100 men into the cold waters of Haifa
Bay. At least 19 sailors drowned, and scores were injured. The
sailors were part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq.
   Vickery, 33, was among four American sailors interviewed at
Haifa's Rambam Hospital. He is from Jacksonville, Fla., is not far
from Mayport, the Saragota's home port.
   Three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water over
the stern in heavy seas, then capsized when it was hit by a big
wave.
   Vickery said the fatal wave came about a minute after he had
cracked his joke.
   ``All of a sudden, I saw water just come flying in,'' he said.
``And it was maybe two seconds, and the boat rolled right over.''
   The 13-year veteran sailor found himself trapped in the ferry's
cabin, frantically struggling to find a window as the ship sank.
   ``I started breathing in water and almost died,'' Vickery said.
``If I had been under the water maybe another 30 seconds, I
wouldn't be lying here right now. I'd be in one of those body bags
out there.''
   When he made his way to the surface he found ``guys floating
everywhere, screaming and yelling like chaos.''
   Despite his own predicament, he grabbed a struggling fellow
sailor by the collar and dragged him toward a floating, plastic
foam life ring. One rescue boat, already overloaded, passed by and
threw life preservers.
   In what ``seemed like an hour,'' another boat came, also full.
   ``So they just dragged us through the water back to the
Saratoga, and I was a real happy person to see those guys snatching
me up,'' he said.
   As Vickery was being treated for bleeding lungs caused by water
inhalation, his hospital roommate, Seaman Michael Benjamin, 19, of
San Antonio, Texas, was recovering from a neck injury suffered when
a rescue boat hit him while he was in the water.
   Both were wearing blue hospital pajamas and, when they walked to
the visiting room's balcony could see the Saratoga anchored outside
the Haifa harbor.
   Benjamin, who has been in the navy for just a year, said the
ferry had been jostled in heavy seas.
   ``As we were going on the waves, I just noticed one that was
bigger than normal and then another one that was bigger than
normal,'' he said. ``The next thing I know, all I saw coming in was
water,'' he said.
   Benjamin said he dove from the ferry, then had to swim
frantically to get away from the suction of the sinking boat.
   Clinging to a foam plastic float, he was passed by one rescue
boat and hit by a second.
   ``I looked around and I see this big hull coming at me and we
were all yelling, but I guess the ship didn't see us,'' he said.
``I was trying to get out of the way, but I got hit by the ship.''
   Dazed, Benjamin stripped off his jacket, shirt and shoes and
kept treading water until he found a piece of driftwood to cling
to.
   ``I was scared,'' he admitted. ``I was having a hard time
staying up in the water.''
   A rescue ship picked him up, he estimated, about a half hour to
45 minutes later.
   Two other men interviewed at Rambam Hospital identified
themselves as Technician John Richards, 31, of Twin Lake, Mich.,
and Airman Lamont Jones, 20, of Claremont, Va.
   Both were breathing with difficulty despite gas masks.
   Richards recalled seeing a large wave and feeling the ship
heeling to one side.
   ``All I can remember thinking is, `Oh my God, it's sinking,' and
then I was scrambling for my life,'' he said faintly.
