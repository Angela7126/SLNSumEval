    U.S. Navy aircraft joined the search today for survivors of the ferry sinking
that left 471 people missing in shark-infested Red Sea waters but found
nothing but empty life rafts and debris.;   Investigators, meanwhile, were
looking into complaints from some of the 178 survivors that the crew of the
Salem Express abandoned ship without helping them into lifeboats or flotation
gear.

    They also want to know why the ferry strayed outside standard navigational
channels. The 1,105-ton ship went down Saturday night about six miles off the
Egyptian coast after ramming into a coral reef in stormy 10-foot seas.;   "We
are looking for both survivors and bodies," said Brig. Abdel-Karim el-Gazzar,
Egypt's deputy chief of port security. "We haven't lost all hope that there
may be some survivors, although the odds are against it.";   Prime Minister
Atef Sidki, who traveled to Safaga, said many passengers may have been on
lifeboats driven far from the wreck scene by strong winds.;   Ahmed Gamal
Sobhi, Safaga's city council chairman, said only four bodies were recovered by
Egyptian vessels and helicopters and the time nightfall and bad weather
stopped Sunday's search.;   The weather improved today as two helicopters from
the U.S. Navy frigate Aubrey Fitch, which joined in the rescue effort on
Sunday night, and a Navy P-3 submarine-chaser aircraft made their first
daylight search runs, said Lt. Cmdr. Rudolph Brewington, a Pentagon duty
officer.;   "They've observed lots of wreckage, empty life rafts, an oil slick
but no additional bodies and no survivors," he said.;   Survivors said that
after the ship struck the reef, crew members herded them to one side of the
listing boat to keep it from heeling over, then pushed passengers aside to get
to the lifeboats.;   "They went off in a boat," passenger Abdel-A'ati Hassan,
31, said from his hospital bed in Safaga. "They left us with women and kids,
who died.";   The Salem Express was near the end of a 36-hour trip from
Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to Safaga, about 290 miles south of Cairo. Many of the
passengers were Muslims returning from off-season pilgrimages to Mecca and
others were returning to Egypt after stints as guest workers in Saudi Arabia.;
  Outside the harbor, scores of relatives of passengers squatted on a sidewalk
or huddled in taxis, awaiting word about their kin.;   Hassan Al-Aghouri,
Egypt's chief of port security, said the Egyptian-registered ferry
inexplicably left standard navigational channels and investigators were
seeking to question surviving crew about the course change.;   The
investigation also will try to determine whether the ferry was carrying enough
lifeboats.;   Al-Ahram, a leading Cairo newspaper, said in an unattributed
report today that the vessel left the charted navigation channel to take a
shortcut. It said naval authorities warned the skipper back on course to avoid
the area's abundant coral reefs.;   But strong winds sent the boat out of
control, the newspaper said.;   The boat's first mate, Mahmoud Soleiman
Rizake, said a "terrible explosion" from the collision awoke him in his
cabin.;   "Water flooded the ship in 10 minutes, causing it to sink," he said,
adding that he jumped overboard and swam until a rescue boat picked him up.;  
The temperature of the water was not immediately known, but the air
temperature was about 50 degrees and many of the survivors were treated for
exposure. At least 118 of the survivors were hospitalized.;   El-Gazzar, the
deputy port security chief, said all but 10 of the passengers were Egyptians.
