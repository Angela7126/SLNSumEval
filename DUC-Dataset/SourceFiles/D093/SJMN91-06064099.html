    A boat carrying hundreds of Somali refugees struck a reef off Kenya and sank,
killing more than 130 people, newspapers reported.;    The accident involving
a vessel ferrying about 600 people occurred Friday near Malindi, a tourist
resort about 400 miles southeast of Nairobi.

    First accounts of the accident were reported Sunday in Kenyan newspapers.
Two English-language dailies said the accident occurred one mile off the
coast, but a third said it was six miles away.;    Police, navy divers,
tourists and local residents had recovered about 130 bodies by Saturday
afternoon, but 50 victims were believed still trapped in the sunken vessel,
according to the newspapers.;    Confirmation from local authorities of the
accounts was not immediately available.;    The boat with the refugees had set
sail from the Somali town of Kismayo, 250 miles north of Malindi, on Feb. 26.;
   It was one of a stream of vessels that brought thousands of Somalis seeking
refuge to Kenya since rebels overthrew Somalian President Mohamed Siad Barre
in late January. The victory followed a month of heavy fighting in Mogadishu,
capital of the East African nation.;    The fighting appears largely to have
stopped since the rebel United Somali Congress established an interim
government, but refugees continue to arrive in Kenya.;    Abdi Mohammed Ali, a
survivor, was quoted as telling the Standard newspaper that most of those who
drowned were on the ship's lower deck.;    First word of the accident came
when two survivors staggered into the Jambo Club tourist hotel, manager Barney
Ngare was quoted as saying by the Sunday Nation.;    The hotel sent a small
boat to help save those still on the sinking vessel, but rescue workers had to
cut the lifeline when too many people grabbed hold, according to Ngare.;   
Another boat sent by the hotel ferried 15 people at a time to shore, said the
Nation.;    Eleven Somalis drowned when a boat capsized off Kenya near Lamu,
north of Malindi, on Feb. 1.
