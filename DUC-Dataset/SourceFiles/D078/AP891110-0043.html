    Oscar Trophy Has No Copyright.

    The Oscar statuette, one of the most
recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright
protection, a federal judge has ruled.
   The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain,
U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling released
Thursday.
   The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of
an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.
   Academy President Karl Malden said the ruling ``comes as a shock
to me.'' The academy said it would appeal.
   The academy claimed that the Star Award, the trophy look-alike
made by Creative House Promotions, violated copyright laws, diluted
the academy's trademark and represented unfair competition.
   The Star Award depicted a naked, muscular male much like the
Oscar, just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a
sword. It had a gold finish similar to the Oscar, and stood on a
circular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base.
   Although Waters acknowledged that the Creative House trophy is
``very similar'' to the Oscar, he rejected all of the academy's
legal claims, saying that the statuette became part of the public
domain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright
Act of 1976.
   The film industry's top award was distributed from the first
ceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the ``c'' mark indicating
a copyright.
   The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only was an honorary
award but also was used to promote the film industry, and therefore
did not have a ``limited purpose,'' as required by the copyright
act.
   The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette
and that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscar
and the Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected.
   ``We are surprised that the court would base its decision on
events which occurred half a century ago, overlooking the
meticulous fashion in which the Academy has protected the integrity
of its institutional symbol for decades,'' Malden said in a
statement.
