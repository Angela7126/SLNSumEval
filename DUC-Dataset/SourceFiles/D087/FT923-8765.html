    The Barcelona Olympics: Minnows vs big spenders - Tonight's athletics relay finals.
   </title>
   <text>
    TONIGHT in the big stadium in Barcelona the athletics is dominated by the
four relay finals. Tonight it is nation versus nation.
What the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is
that at the Olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries -
or to those, rather, that choose to lavish resources on athletes.
The US has comfortably won the most relay medals, followed by Britain, the
former Soviet Union, the former West Germany (not even counting the six won
before 1939), the former East Germany, France and Canada.
Britain alone have won more relay medals (23) than all the Caribbean islands
(nine) and Africa (four, including one for South Africa). The Dutch, with
one, have more relay medals than all the nations of Asia (nil) and South
America (nil) combined. The Cuban women's 100 metres relay teams of 1968 and
1972 are the only women from outside the developed world to have won relay
medals.
With a little luck - with their nerve-stretching hand-overs the relays
always require a little luck - the developing countries will continue the
gentle redistribution of medals. But although they have talent, few can
match the strength in depth of the traditional relay powers.
The US 4x400m squad has been weakened by the injury to Danny Everett. Even
so they rested Steve Lewis, the 400m silver medallist, in last night's
semi-finals. In the 4x100m heats James Jett replaced Carl Lewis but Lewis
ran impressively in last night's semi-final and tonight will pursue his
eighth Olympic gold.
One thing that became clear on Thursday, when Lewis won his seventh gold
with victory in the long jump, was that while winning at the Olympics may
bring other athletes excitement or relief, Lewis simply adores the
experience.
When Voula Patoulidou, looking up at the giant video screen after the
women's 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that she
had won a gold medal, she went delightfully and utterly potty, as did the
other 25 Greeks in the stadium, including Queen Sofia of Spain.
Lewis, on the other hand, seemed unsurprised when Mike Powell was unable to
overhaul him in the long jump. Even though the long jump had not finished
and even though 5,000m runners were trudging through a semi-final, Lewis
began at once an extremely hammy lap-and-a-half of honour.
He tried to orchestrate a Mexican wave. This is a man who derives immense
pleasure from winning in front of a packed house. Lewis will be difficult to
suppress tonight.
Noureddine Morcelli of Algeria will be hard to beat in the men's 1,500m.
Morcelli is one of five Africans in the final striving to increase their
continent's tally of just three Olympic medals (all Kenyan) in this event.
Even here there is a US connection: Morcelli attended Riverside Community
College in California, to hone his running on good tracks.
On Thursday night, Morcelli cruised through his heat in first place after
the gentlest push on the accelerator. The Moroccan Rachid Al-Basir followed
him down the straight, a respectful step behind, looming over his fellow
Arab and glancing anxiously round like a bodyguard. Morcelli has not been
beaten in the 1,500m since 1990.
