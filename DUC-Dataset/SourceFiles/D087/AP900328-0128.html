    The late Jesse Owens, whose performance at the
1936 Olympics put the lie to Hitler's boasts of racial superiority,
picked up a fifth gold medal Wednesday for ``humanitarian
contributions in the race of life.''
   President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to his
widow, Ruth Owens, in a ceremony at the White House also attended
by three daughters and teammates of the track legend.
   This Saturday marks the 10th anniversary of Owens' death at age
66.
   The president later hailed Owens's multiple gold medals in the
Berlin games ``a victory for humanity'' in prepared remarks to a
banquet sponsored by the U.S. Olympic Committee.
   ``The Olympics, like democracy, are a kind of dialogue _ a way
that nations can converse in the language of friendly competition,
not deadly conflict,'' Bush said.
   Bush called Owens, who was black, an ``Olympic hero and an
American hero every day of his life ... born with the gift of
burning speed.''
   ``He was always the fastest,'' said Bush, recalling the
afternoon in May 1935 when the Ohio State runner broke three world
records and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes.
   ``Talk about a guy in a hurry,'' Bush laughed. ``He was the
epitome of that.''
   At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Owens captured four gold
medals _ in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and
400-meter relay.
   ``The Berlin Games were to be the showcase of Hitler's theories
on the superiority of the master race until this 23-year-old kid''
showed up, Bush said. ``It was an unrivaled athletic triumph. But
more than that, it really was a triumph for all humanity.''
   Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it was not those
athletic feats but ``his humanitarian contributions in the race of
life'' that earned Owens the Congressional Gold Medal.
   Owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving as ``a
special ambassador for sports,'' said Bush. He said the athlete's
legacy lives on through the Jesse Owens Games, a playground
Olympics; the Jesse Owens International Trophy for amateur athletes
and the Jesse Owens Foundation, which awards scholarships to needy
youth.
   ``Despite the many honors, his greatest satisfaction came from
his work with youth,'' said Mrs. Owens, 74.
   Attending the ceremony along with Owens' family were former
Olympians Mal Whitfield, Harrison Dillard and Herb Douglass; former
teammates John Chavers, Samuel Devine and Chester Thomas, and two
Ohio Democrats, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Louis Stokes, who
spearheaded the drive to strike the medal.
   The silver-haired Mrs. Owens, standing outside the White House
afterwards, called the event ``absolutely beautiful.'' She added:
``I'm sure with the sun shining straight down, Jesse's watching us,
too.''
