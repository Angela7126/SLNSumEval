    Unsafe Buildings Bulldozed as Recovery From Killer Quake Continues.

   <text>
    Police bulldozed teetering houses Tuesday
to keep people from returning to homes left unsafe by an earthquake
that killed at least 731 people in India and Nepal.
   Officials in both countries expected the death toll to rise as
relief workers reached remote towns that have been inaccessible
since Sunday's devastating quake.
   Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that continued Tuesday,
while others had 3-foot-deep cracks or were blocked by boulders the
size of houses in the Himalayan mountains and valleys.
   At least 531 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur
Thapa, additional secretary in the Home Affairs Ministry.
   Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan, one of
the hardest-hit towns, and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once
three-story and five-story houses.
   ``This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal,'' Shrestha said
as he toured the town.
   India reported an official death toll of 200, but the figure was
disputed by news media and opposition politicians who put the
Indian death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500.
   In Darbhanga, India on Tuesday, worshipers offered sweets, milk
and coconuts to appease the Hindu god of destruction. Women dressed
in colorful saris gathered at countryside temples in the
quake-ravaged areas of eastern Bihar state to pray and present
their offerings to Lord Shiva, the god of destruction in the Hindu
trinity.
   ``If God is pleased, nothing will happen,'' said one woman, who
refused to give her name.
   The earthquake, which struck shortly before daybreak Sunday when
most people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale.
It was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950 when a temblor
in the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official count
and 30,000 by seismologists' accounts.
   Dharan, 105 miles southeast of Katmandu, sits on a rolling plain
at the base of a steep hill. At least 131 bodies have been found in
the town of 100,000.
   Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made of
bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal
monsoon rains.
   Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolished
more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation. ``We will
continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied (the ones
remaining) are safe to live in,'' he said.
   British soldiers from a nearby Gurkha recruiting center pitched
in with cranes to aid the demolition. Dharan is in the heart of
regional famed for fierce Gurkha fighters who have served in the
British army for more than 150 years.
   Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from the
government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes
were demolished. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors
of found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth.
   The hardest hit areas in India were in Bihar state just across
the Nepalese border.
   Rescuers in army helicopters searched for survivors in Bihar's
Darbhanga, Madhubani and Mungar districts. Other helicopters
ferried medicine, rice, cooking oil, clothes and tents to police
trapped in the most remote regions of Bihar, India's poorest state.
   Heavy rains, overflowing rivers and submerged bridges and roads
hampered attempts by 1,000 Indian soldiers to provide assistance.
   In Nepal, 88-pound bags of rice were being distributed to
families affected by the quake, but officials were unable to give
any figures.
   International agencies operating in Nepal were gearing up to
contribute supplies or assistance but have not yet heard from the
government on what was wanted, according to several foreign relief
workers who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Shrestha said the mountain kingdom had not sought foreign aid
because ``we are still assessing the magnitude of the tragedy.''
Some supplies, medicine and health workers arrived in eastern Nepal
on Tuesday. Donors included UNICEF and the government of Japan and
Britain.
   Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. Two-third of the
children under age of 5 suffer from malnutrition and life
expectancy is 52, according to UNICEF. A nation of 17 million,
Nepal has one doctor for every 22,650 people, compared with 5,000
people per doctor in India and 780 per doctor in the United States.
   Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's earthquake, and rumors
of an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the
streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan. The
rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by word of
mouth. In Dharan, men ran from houses to houses rousing people from
their sleep.
