    Earthquake Death Toll Rises As Rescue Teams Reach Remote Areas.
   </title>
   <text>
    The death toll from the Himalayan
earthquake topped 750 on Wednesday as rescue workers hampered by
monsoon rains, aftershocks and washed out roads reached remote
areas of Nepal and found more bodies.
   In eastern India, which also was devastated by the quake, cracks
were found in the embankments of six rivers in Bihar state, and
officials said floods could pose the next threat to the 10 million
people.
   ``It may be the second coming. All the rivers are in full spate,
and if the embankments breach, we are in for serious problems,''
said Puranman Mittal, the relief commissioner in Bihar state, which
suffered the most damage in India.
   Bihar residents ran screaming through the streets on Wednesday
when a mild tremor rumbled through the area. No casualties or
damage was reported, witnesses and the Seismological Observatory in
New Delhi said.
   Residents in Dharan, the worst-hit area of Nepal, also raced
from their homes Wednesday during two aftershocks, officials in
Katmandu said. No further damage was reported in the city, where
100 houses collapsed during the quake.
   Rescue workers demolished 50 homes in Dharan on Wednesday that
were severely damaged in the temblor, police inspector G. Adhikari
said.
   ``We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied
(the ones remaining) are to safe to live in,'' he said.
   ``This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal,'' Prime Minister
Marich Man Singh Shrestha, said Tuesday after a tour of devastated
areas in his nation.
   At least 758 people died and 950 were injured in both countries
Sunday when the earthquake jolted the mountainous India-Nepal
border region.
   It was the deadliest quake to strike the subcontinent since
1950, when, by official count, 1,500 people were killed in the
eastern Indian state of Assam.
   Indian officials said Wednesday that at least 196 died in India
in Sunday's disaster. Officials in Nepal said at least 562 people
were killed in Nepal, including 31 people whose bodies were found
in remote areas on Wednesday.
   In India's Bihar state, officials said the water had reached
dangerous levels and was still rising in six rivers: the Ganges,
the Ghagara, the Burigandak, the Bagmati, the Koshi and the
Mahananada.
   To make matters worse, survey teams found cracks in the
embankments of the six rivers, which are swollen by monsoon rains
that began in late June.
   Engineers tried to strengthen the weakened embankments with
cement, and helicopters made aerial surveys watching for ruptures.
   As survivors in both countries began rebuilding homes damaged or
destroyed by the quake, medicine, food and financial aid began
arriving from abroad.
   Elroy J. Carlson, an official at the U.S. Embassy in Katmandu,
said the United State offered $25,000 in aid. In New Delhi, U.S.
Ambassador John Gunther Dean presented the government with a
similar amount for Indian victims.
   Michael Hamilton, an official at the British Embassy in
Katmandu, said three medical teams had been sent to Dharan. ``The
teams are carrying two truckloads of blood and medicine,'' Hamilton
said.
   The British army also runs a military hospital in Dharan, where
at least 100 people were admitted. The government hospital in
Dharan treated hundreds of people injured when brick and wood
houses collapsed.
   U.N. agencies and the Red Cross also sent medical teams to
Nepal, and the government began distributing 90-pound bags of rice.
   The relief efforts were hampered in both countries by heavy
rains which cut off communications and road links to several of the
affected areas.
   ``The earthquake hit a wide area, and it is a big job to reach
the remote villages. But we are trying,'' said Mittal, the relief
official in Bihar state.
