    Quake Along India-Nepal Border Reportedly Leaves More Than 200
Dead.

    A strong earthquake triggered landslides
and destroyed houses in the mountainous India-Nepal border region
early Sunday, killing at least 237 people and injuring more than
1,500, officials and news reports said.
   Seismologists said it was the deadliest earthquake to strike the
Himalayan region since 1950.
   More than 100 people died when the quake rumbled through the
eastern Indian state of Bihar, officials said. In Nepal,
authorities said at least 137 people were dead. Officials in both
countries predicted the death toll would rise after they received
reports from remote areas which were hit harder.
   ``The tolls have come in only from urban areas,'' said V.K.
Sharma, deputy secretary in the Bihar government.
   The temblor also jolted parts of northern Bangladesh and the
capital of Dhaka, but there were no immediate reports of casualties
or damage.
   Witnesses said windows and doors rattled, buildings cracked and
people roused from their sleep ran screaming from their homes as
objects tumbled from shelves and tables.
   ``My bed rattled, then it began swinging,'' said R.N. Rudra, a
resident of Patna, the Bihar capital. ``My dogs began barking and I
rushed out of the house.''
   At least 1,000 people were injured when the quake triggered
landslides and house collapses in Bihar and the surrounding states
of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa, all heavily populated,
largely agricultural areas.
   The quake also was felt in Sikkim and Tripura, located in the
Himalayan foothills, the Press Trust of India news agency said.
   In Nepal, a Foreign Ministry official, Shailendra Kumar
Upadhyaya, said more than 500 people were injured and thousands of
houses collapsed from the quake's impact.
   ``Most of them (were) buried alive under collapsed houses,''
said Indra Shrestha, a social worker involved in the rescue
operation in Dharan Bazar, a township of about 100,000 people about
18 miles from the Indian border.
   Shrestha said rescue operations were being hampered by the
monsoon rains, which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually
last through September.
   Both countries were rushing emergency medical teams to the area.
The Red Cross of Nepal issued urgent appeals for blood donations.
   In India's Bihar state, communications with Darbhanga, which
appeared to be the worst-hit area, were disrupted. The Press Trust
of India said a school hostel in the town collapsed, killing at
least 17 children. It said more bodies were feared buried under the
debris.
   The quake damaged most of the houses in Darbhanga, the news
agency said, quoting P.K. Patnaik, the top civil administrator in
the district. Deaths were also reported in the neighboring towns of
Munger, Keoti and Narpatnagar.
   The tremor also was felt in the eastern city of Calcutta, Press
Trust of India said. There were no immediate reports of casualties
but residents were quoted as saying windows of several homes
vibrated and doors rattled.
   The Seismological Observatory in New Delhi said the quake hit at
4:40 a.m. (7:10 p.m. EDT Saturday) and was centered 40 to 50 miles
northeast of the town of Darbhanga in Bihar state, along the
India-Nepal border. Observatory Director H.N. Srivastava said the
quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale.
   Srivastava said the quake lasted about one minute and
aftershocks continued for about an hour. Seismologists warned
aftershocks could continue for days.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said its initial seismograph readings
placed the center of the quake 100 miles southeast of Katmandu, the
capital of Nepal. Geological Survey monitors in Golden, Colo.,
recorded the earthquake at a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 on the
Richter scale.
   The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as
measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of
magnitude 6 is capable of causing severe damage.
   Earthquakes are common in the Himalayan region. On Aug. 6 a
quake of magnitude 7.3 shook the states of Assam, Manipur, West
Bengal and Bihar. Four people were killed. India's worst earthquake
was in 1950, when at least 30,000 people were killed in Assam state.
