    Death Toll at 749 In Quake.
   </title>
   <text>
    Police bulldozed unstable brick and mud
houses today while those left homeless by an earthquake that killed
at least 749 people sought shelter and awaited government aid.
   Casualty reports continued to trickle in from remote parts of
this Himalayan mountain kingdom as relief workers fanned out
through the foothills and valleys. Sunday's pre-dawn quake struck
near the India-Nepal border.
   Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that followed the quake.
Others had cracks three feet deep or were blocked by boulders the
size of houses.
   At least 549 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa
of the Home Affairs Ministry. Dharan was hardest hit. At least 131
bodies were found in the city of 100,000.
   Indian officials have maintained since Monday that the death
toll in their country was 200 or less, but the figure was
questioned by opposition politicians, survivors and the local
media, including the Times of India, a newspaper that generally
supports the government.
   They put the India death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500.
   Indian officials said 200 people were injured in the quake.
Nepalese officials listed 752 injured, down from their earlier
estimate of 1,000.
   In Bhaktapur, a city of 50,000 where seven people died in the
quake, 63-year-old Nhuchhe Raj Sakya said his five-story brick and
mud house had nearly fallen down but that he and his family of 10
were still living in it.
   ``What else can we do?'' the goldsmith said. ``We have no tent.
How can I leave my place?''
   Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan on
Tuesday and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once three-story and
five-story houses.
   ``This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal,'' Shrestha said
as he toured the town.
   Dharan, 105 miles southeast of Katmandu, sits on a rolling plain
at the base of a steep hill. Most of the victims died in their
houses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that had
loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains.
   Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolished
more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation.
   ``We will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied
(the ones remaining) are safe to live in,'' he said.
   Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from the
government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes
were demolished. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors
or found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth.
   The earthquake, which struck when most people were still asleep,
registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and was the deadliest quake in
the region since 1950, when a temblor in the east Indian state of
Assam killed 1,500 by official count and 30,000 by seismologists'
accounts.
   Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's quake, and rumors of
an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the
streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan.
   The rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by
word of mouth. In Dharan, men ran from houses to houses rousing
people from their sleep.
