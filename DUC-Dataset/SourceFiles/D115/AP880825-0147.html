    The parents of a Peace Corps worker
learned Thursday that their son, a volunteer in Nepal, was safe
following an earthquake last weekend that killed at least 750
people in that country and neighboring India.
   ``They called this morning, that's the first we had heard about
anything since the quake,'' said Arthur Giaquinta, whose
24-year-old son, Peter, lives in a village 10 miles north of the
hard-hit Dharan Bazar township.
   Jim Flanigan, a Peace Corps spokesman in Washington, said Peter
Giaquinta was ``fine as far as we know.''
   In Boston, the brother of Peace Corps volunteer Bettyjean
Bouffard, 27, said Thursday she called her relatives to say she was
safe. The call, said Dave Bouffard, was the first news the family
had had of her safety.
   ``We're ecstatic,'' he said, adding that his sister had been
living with a Nepalese family five miles from the earthquake
epicenter.
   Flanigan said the Peace Corps has been able to track down all
but three of the 157 volunteers in Nepal. There are no Peace Corps
members in India, he said.
   The three, he said, are from Michigan, Wisconsin and the
Philadelphia area; he declined to release their names.
   ``We have a problem with roads out, monsoon rains,'' Flanigan
said. ``In the best of times, reaching some of these volunteers is
several days.''
