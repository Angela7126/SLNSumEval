    WASHINGTON -- U.S. intelligence officials had been
sounding alarms in recent days about a possible Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
   Emphasizing that the Central Intelligence Agency wasn't
surprised by the Iraqi action, an agency spokesman said
yesterday, "We provided policy makers with very useful and
timely information on these events and we continue to do so."

    Administration and congressional officials agree that the
CIA did its job. Since last week, President Bush had been
warned by intelligence analysts that what originally looked
like a military bluff was quickly turning into the kind of
troop deployment that could be used to invade Kuwait or even
Saudi Arabia.
   Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster even
hand-delivered certain fresh details on the Iraqi buildup to
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Among the
assessments he conveyed was a conclusion that, by this week,
President Saddam Hussein's force would be capable of
penetrating Kuwait or Saudi Arabia.
   The agency lacked hard evidence of an intent to invade,
intelligence officials say. But as the buildup grew, the CIA
became more alarmed, partly because Mr. Hussein is so
unpredictable, and partly because, unlike many other Arab
leaders, he has been known to carry out his threats.
