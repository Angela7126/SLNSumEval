    Kuwaiti `Free Government' Statements Indicate Iraqi Control.

    Iraq says it invaded Kuwait at the
request of a revolutionary organization there, but diplomats
dismiss that rationale as a large-scale charade.
   The diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the
flood of statements issued from Iraq in the name of the Provisional
Free Kuwait Government.
   Britain's U.N. ambassador, Crispin Tickell, called the Iraqi
action ``an invasion from the outside ... a phony coup d'etat from
within.'' He said the invasion had led to ``the purported
establishment of a puppet government.''
   In a rare display of solidarity, the United States and the
Soviet Union called for Iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions. The
U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.
   But Iraq's deputy permanent U.N. representative, Sabah Talat
Kadrat, said the Security Council should not be debating the issue,
because the fall of the Kuwaiti Emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah, was an internal matter.
   The official Kuwait News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, did not
issue a single story all day. Its computer periodically sputtered
out the phrase ``Line cut.''
   On the other hand, state-run Iraqi News Agency from Baghdad came
alive with a series of communiques from the ``provisional
government.'' The members were not identified.
   The first statement said the provisional government ``finds that
one of its primordial obligations is to remedy the harm done by the
deposed, corrupt government to our brothers in Iraq.''
   Iraq has been feuding with Kuwait over a border dispute. It has
also accused Kuwait of violating its oil production quotas set by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, costing Iraq of
much-needed revenues because oil is cheaper when supplies are
higher.
   The statement on the Iraqi News Agency said the border dispute
would be settled with ``fraternity and Arab national interests,''
indicating Iraq would probably take the land it wants.
   The statement also said the Al-Sabah family, which had ruled
Kuwait for almost 250 years, was working in concert with Zionist
and colonial powers to plot against Iraq.
   That is the charge the Iraqi press leveled at Kuwait when
tensions began to rise in mid-July.
   ``Falsification of elections, authoritarianism, persecution of
patriotic personalities have always been characteristics of the
Al-Sabah family,'' the statement said.
   Kuwait is one of the few Arab states that has experimented with
a freely elected parliament. A new National Council with 50 members
voted into office and 25 appointed by the emir took office after
June elections.
   The communiques from the Iraqi News Agency said the National
Council has been disbanded.
