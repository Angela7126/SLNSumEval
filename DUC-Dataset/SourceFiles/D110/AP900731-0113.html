    100,000 Troops Massed on Iraq-Kuwait Border as Talks Begin.

    Kuwaiti and Iraqi negotiators
embraced warmly Tuesday as they began talks on their oil and border
dispute, sources said. Diplomats reported that Iraq had massed
100,000 troops on Kuwait's border.
   Gulf-based diplomatic sources said the Iraqi force, triple the
number earlier reported, included about 300 Soviet-made tanks, and
dwarfed the entire Kuwaiti army of 20,000 troops.
   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
troops have been concentrated along the border since last week,
when Iraq began threatening Kuwait. Iraq accused the small Persian
Gulf state of stealing oil from a disputed border region and
forcing oil prices to drop. The diplomats said the number of troops
was at first difficult to determine.
   The delegation leaders, Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheik
Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah of Kuwait, and Izzat Ibrahim, deputy
chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, met privately for
two hours.
   There were no details on the negotiations, but sources said the
meetings will continue Wednesday.
   Diplomatic sources have said they expect Arab mediators to push
the two sides to sign a treaty of non-belligerency to be followed
by protracted negotiations on borders and compensation.
   The Iraq-Kuwait crisis broke out on July 17 when Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of
driving down oil prices by exceeding quotas set for them by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Saddam said the move
cost Iraq $14 billion in lost revenue.
   Saddam also demanded compensation for the $2.4 billion in oil he
claimed Kuwait pumped illegally from an oil field which straddles
the unmarked border between the two countries.
   Iraq also demanded that Kuwait forgive $15 billion in loans it
extended to Baghdad during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraq's tough talk appeared to have succeeded. Kuwait and the
U.A.E agreed to stick to their oil quotas at an OPEC meeting last
week. OPEC member states also agreed to a longstanding Iraqi demand
to raised target crude oil prices from $18 to $21 a barrel.
   Kuwaiti and Iraqi officials agreed to meet in Jiddah after
intensive mediation efforts by King Fahd and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.
   Kuwaiti leaders had insisted that Iraq pull back its troops
before conciliation talks could began, but later dropped that
demand.
   Kuwaiti officials also asked that Iraq agree to demarcate the
disputed border between the nations, a move Iraq has refused.
   Iraq has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait and has long
coveted the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warba, which command
access to Iraq's sole outlet into the Persian Gulf.
   The mediators have succeeded in toning down a vitriolic campaign
against Kuwait by the Iraqi state-run media.
   On Tuesday, the Iraqi delegation left Baghdad without any public
announcement.
   The leading Al-Thawra daily newspaper called the Jiddah meeting
``an opportunity ... for Kuwait ... to perceive Iraq's demands and
respond to its rights.''
   In contrast, the Kuwaiti delegation left for Jiddah with fanfare
and publicity.
   The Kuwaiti papers said they hoped the Jiddah meeting was the
start of ``a final just settlement'' of the differences between
Iraq and Kuwait, in a manner ensuring the ``legitimate rights of
each.''
