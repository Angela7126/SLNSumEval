    Freedom Signs Gone, Tiananmen Square is Now an Armed Camp.

    Gone from Tiananmen Square are the pro-democracy
banners and the tents of China's freedom movement, replaced by
tanks, armed guards and the chants of drilling soldiers.
   The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their first
glance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into the
capital six days ago, leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movement
for political change.
   Troops moved back their barricades, making it possible for city
residents to walk to the edge of the square, which for seven weeks
stood at the heart of the movement. Buses and bicyclists today were
allowed to pass by Changan Avenue, which borders the north edge of
the square.
   The spot once occupied by the Goddess of Democracy, a
33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, was taken by a
tread-wheeled armored personnel carrier. When students built the
statue last week, for a few days it became a symbol of the movement
for democratic reforms and an end to official corruption. On Sunday
morning, a tank crushed it.
   In all, 80 tanks and 40 armored personnel carriers lined the
northern part of the square.
   The Monument to Revolutionary Martyrs, where the students took a
final stand early Sunday, was swept clean. Poems and posters calling
for a more open China have disappeared from its sides.
   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and
60,000 injured over the weekend, citing a Chinese students'
organization, the Union of Chinese Students in West Germany. The
government says nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed;
diplomats and Chinese say up to 3,000 died.
   Soldiers drilled in Tiananmen's center, their cadenced shouting
echoing around the vast expanse. A crowd of officials stood on the
roof of the Great Hall of the People, overlooking the square. From
this same roof five days earlier officials watched as a jubilant
mass of demonstrators enveloped 5,000 troops and blocked their entry
to the square.
   Inside the square, soldiers could be seen shuffling about, their
uniformed jackets stripped off, wash basins in hand. There was a
relaxed air of the inside of an army barracks as unarmed troops
carried food and walked slowly together, talking and laughing in
groups.
   The area once housing students' tents has become a holding area
for a huge fleet of troop trucks.
   On the southern perimeter, a single line of tanks and a cordon of
soldiers blocked the square from the thousands of bicylists who
pedaled slowly by, peering into Tiananmen.
   Near the square, troops placed barbed wire in front of one
street. Soldiers were billeted in a construction site, their
laundered fatigues drying on the scaffolding. Next door, troops,
their assault rifles slung nonchalantly over their shoulders, stood
and chatted outside a discotheque.
   ``They look like they ,'' said one local resident. ``I hope they
know that we still don't want them here.''
