    Tiananmen Square Resembles Battlefield in Assault on Students.
   </title>
   <text>
    Dawn broke Sunday over a battle-scarred Tiananmen
Square with tanks and rifle-toting troops ruling the vast expanse
occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society from
their communist rulers.
   A low cloud of smoke covered much of the 100-acre square as
bonfires set during the night's confrontation continued to smolder.
   Hundreds of helmeted troops were deployed on the monument to
revolutionary heroes in the square's center and thousands more at
important intersections nearby. Tanks moved into place on what had
hours earlier been a rag-tag squatter's camp of tents for the
pro-democracy students.
   The battle for Tiananmen was primarily fought in the streets
leading to the square, where scores of people fell trying to
prevent columns of troops and armored military vehicles from moving
on the students.
   Gunfire could be heard from several sides, and tracers zipped
through the sky above Mao Tse-tung's mausoleum, one of the main
monuments to Chinese communism in the square. Torched buses and
army vehicles on the streets around Tiananmen billowed acrid smoke.
   Troops first entered the square from the south, when a column
trotted toward the student encampment about 1 a.m. (noon EDT
Saturday). They took up positions to the east after a brief
skirmish involving clubs and sticks with students.
   More soldiers were deployed in front of the Great Hall of the
People to the west, and a huge convoy with armored vehicles rolled
down Changan Avenue to the north side.
   The few thousand students remaining in the square stayed calm as
they quietly gathered on the steps of the heroes' monument. ``I'm
not afraid,'' several said as the heavily armed troops encircled.
   Hundreds of supporters continued to mill around the square, many
dressed more for a summer outing than a military battle.
   Loudspeakers blaring government and student announcements
engaged in a noisy propaganda battle throughout the night.
   ``The government is corrupt, you've been tricked,'' the students
roared. The state-run speaker warned that troops would use every
means at their disposal to clear the square and that remaining
students would bear responsibility for the consequences.
   At 4 a.m., the lamposts that dot the square went ominously dark,
and the student loudspeaker played the Internationale, the
socialist anthem. A Taiwan singer staging a hunger strike for
democracy took the microphone and proclaimed: ``We've achieved a
big victory. ... We're not afraid to die, but we've already lost
too much blood.''
   After the lights went back on a half hour later, a voice vote by
the students showed most wanted to leave the square to avoid
further bloodshed.
   They quickly filed out under the banners of their schools,
carrying the quilts and padded jackets that offered warmth during
the 22-day sit-in. Neither the students nor the Beijing residents
who arrived to show support could control their tears.
   ``Go with us,'' they told their supporters, who applauded the
students as they retreated. As they sobbed, many students defiantly
shouted: ``We shall return!'' and flashed V-for-victory signs.
