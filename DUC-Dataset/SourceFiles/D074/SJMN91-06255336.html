    (check) About 300 black pastors, representing congregations totaling more
than 1 million churchgoers in 30 states, held a rally on the steps of the
Supreme Court and then lobbied their senators to support confirmation of
President Bush's Supreme Court nominee.;   The ministers were recently
organized into a conservative Coalition for the Restoration of the Black
Family and Society, with the first item on its agenda being Thomas'
confirmation.;   (check) A television ad supporting Thomas, shown in four
Southern states where senators face re-election campaigns next year, attracted
10,000 calls between Friday and Sunday, according to Gary Bauer, organizer of
the conservative Citizens Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas, which financed
the ad's production.;   The ad carries a toll-free telephone number that
viewers are asked to call to register their support for Thomas; callers are
then sorted by states, and the state lists will be sent to the targeted
senators.;   (check) On the other side of the Thomas confirmation issue, the
National Abortion Rights Action League reported that senators had begun to
receive the first of 500,000 anti-Thomas post cards the group has provided to
the constituents of targeted lawmakers whose votes against Thomas'
confirmation are regarded as critical.;   (check) The Lawyers' Committee for
Civil Rights Under Law, a bipartisan group organized in 1963 to assist the
government in civil-rights law enforcement, announced that 86 of about 110
members of its board of directors had decided to oppose Thomas' confirmation.
The announcement said Thomas' legal philosophy reflected a "hostility to and
rejection of the core of civil rights jurisprudence."
