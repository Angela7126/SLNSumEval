    Frustrated Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee say Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas is an evasive witness, but no groundswell of
opposition to his confirmation seems to be emerging.;   Several senators were
openly skeptical Wednesday over Thomas' insistence that he has no opinion on
the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.

    If that's so, said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., "he's the only person gathered
in the room who does not have an opinion.";   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., added,
"I'm concerned about his candor, his willingness to be forthcoming." Kohl was
today's leadoff questioner as the hearings entered their third day.;   Two
pivotal members of the 14-member committee -- Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Arlen
Specter, R-Pa. -- also voiced concern about Thomas' answers. But the panel's
traditional third swing vote, Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said Thomas was doing
well.;   Heflin cited the "appearance of a confirmation conversion" and said
it may raise questions of Thomas' "integrity and temperament.";   But Heflin
added, "I am not at this time of any firm opinion one way or the other" on
whether Thomas should be confirmed.;   And Simon said Thomas' performance thus
far "has neither helped him nor hurt him.";   Specter blamed fellow committee
members more than Thomas in concluding, "We really haven't moved very far in
the process.";   Thomas, a black federal appeals judge, was picked by
President Bush to replace the retiring Thurgood Marshall, the high court's
only black justice.;   DeConcini said he thought the conservative Thomas
"handled the privacy questions very well" without taking a stand on abortion.
"I don't see how you could ask him to do anything more.";   Thomas expanded
earlier testimony by saying Wednesday that he believed the right of marital
privacy was "fundamental" -- a status that accords it the fullest judicial
protection from government intrusion.;   But he repeatedly refused to state
his views on the 1973 abortion decision based on women's right of privacy. To
give such an answer, he said, "would undermine my ability to sit in an
impartial way on such an important case.";   Thomas, who sat alone at the
witness table with no notes or reference materials, also claimed a lack of
familiarity with the subject matter when asked about some of his former
speeches and articles.;   That moved committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
to give Thomas a stack of the judge's past speeches so the nominee could "help
me understand them" during future questioning.;   Thomas, testifying calmly
but warily, did offer fuller comment on another hot issue before the high
court: prayer in public schools.;   After Simon discussed the feelings decades
ago of a Jewish elementary schoolboy who left the room each day while his
classmates recited a prayer, Thomas said, "Any policy of exclusion should be
considered inappropriate.";   Outside the hearing room, abortion-rights
advocates said Thomas should not be allowed to disavow past comments they say
show he would vote to ban most, if not all, abortions.;   "His most
unimpressive testimony poses two equally disturbing possibilities: he is
either willfully misleading the committee about his views to win confirmation,
or he is a man whose convictions have shallow roots," said Arthur Kropp of
People for the American Way.;   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he could not
understand how Thomas' prior statements touching on the 1973 abortion decision
could have been made without considering its content. "I'm not satisfied with
the answers," Leahy said.;   Although Thomas appeared to back away from
comments made in past speeches or articles, he told the committee, "My view is
that I have been consistent.";   Thomas' opponents believe Republicans Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Charles Grassley of Iowa,
Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are solid Thomas backers.; 
 But they hope Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, will be joined by the three swing-vote senators and Biden, Leahy,
Simon and Kohl in voting against the nominee.;   Biden and Kennedy declined
comment Wednesday on their leanings.;   Metzenbaum said Thomas' refusal to
give direct answers "makes it more difficult to vote for him."; THOMAS' VIEWS;
Excerpts from Clarence Thomas' testimony:; On abortion: "I have no reason or
agenda to prejudge the issue ... or a predilection to rule one way or
another on the issue of abortion."; On affirmative action: "The line that I
drew was a line that said that we shouldn't have preferences, or goals, or
timetables or quotas."; On natural law: "At no time did I feel, nor do I feel
now, that natural law is anything more than the background to our
Constitution."; HEAR IT, SEE IT; Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme
Court nominee Clarence Thomas are scheduled to run through Friday this week
and every weekday except Wednesday next week.; RADIO; (box) KQED, 88.5 FM Tape
