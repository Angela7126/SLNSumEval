    Clarence Thomas completed five grueling days of Senate questioning Monday,
apparently well on his way to becoming the second black justice in the history
of the Supreme Court.;   "I have been honored to participate in this process,"
Thomas said before breaking into a broad grin and effusively gripping the
hands of his Judiciary Committee interrogators.

    The committee will continue to hear testimony for and against Thomas at
least through the end of the week, but the outcome does not seem to be in
doubt. Several committee members said they expected the committee to
recommend, by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote, that the Senate confirm Thomas. Regardless
of the outcome, Thomas said on his way out of the hearing, "I have been
treated fairly.";   Before Thomas' testimony ended, the unflappable
43-year-old federal judge was criticized, sometimes in harsh terms, by several
liberal Democrats. They accused him of being evasive and of disavowing many
controversial statements he made while an official of the Reagan and Bush
administrations.;   Thomas repeatedly explained that he made the speeches as
an advocate for administration policy, acknowledging that they often contained
overheated rhetoric.;   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he found it
"difficult to accept the notion that the moment you put on a judge's robe all
the views and positions which you held prior to going on the bench just
magically disappear.";   "I want to look into the window of your soul,"
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said to Thomas. "but I find the shade down quite a
bit.";   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., delivered a long, stinging lecture to
Thomas, declaring: "The vanishing views of Judge Thomas have become a major
issue in these hearings.";   Kennedy listed 10 instances in which he said
Thomas had abandoned or contradicted his previous positions.;   Kennedy told
Thomas he had "walked away" from his record on the right to privacy, refused
to comment on its application to abortion and asked lawmakers "to believe that
an intelligent and outspoken person like yourself has never discussed Roe vs.
Wade (the landmark 1973 abortion-rights ruling) with another human being.";  
Moderate Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who often casts a swing
vote on the committee, said he was not troubled by Thomas' shift toward more
moderate views at the hearings.;   "I believe he's going to be a surprising
justice. I don't think you can pigeonhole this man," Specter said.;   If
Thomas is confirmed as expected, he made it clear that, for the first time in
decades, there would be not one justice on the Supreme Court who is convinced
that capital punishment is unconstitutionally cruel.;   Justice Thurgood
Marshall, whom Thomas would replace, was the last member of the court who
opposed the death penalty in all cases. Thomas told the Judiciary Committee
that "philosophically, there is nothing that would bother me personally about
upholding it (the death penalty) in appropriate cases.";   After Thomas left
the hearing room, an American Bar Association evaluation committee told the
senators that his articles in law journals were deficient in presentation,
content, scholarship and analysis.;   But those limitations were outweighed by
his "brief but highly satisfactory performance on the Court of Appeals," the
committee said, noting that "we found only one opinion to criticize and many
to praise."
