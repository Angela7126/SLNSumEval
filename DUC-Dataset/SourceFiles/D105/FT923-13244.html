    Peace-keepers sent into South Ossetia.

    RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed 'blue helmet' troops to stop ethnic
fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping
operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed
Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide
security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia.
Georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the
border and pulled out all their men from the South Ossetian capital of
Tskhinvali.
But Itar-Tass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four
civilians and injured two others, underscoring the difficulties facing the
operation.
The mission was the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former
Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of
bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the Romanian to the Afghan borders.
Reports from the former Soviet republic of Moldova said several people had
been killed overnight in fresh ceasefire violations between government
forces and separatists.
In the Transcaucasian republic of Armenia, Radio Russia said five civilians
had died overnight in Azerbaijani shelling, the latest victims of a
four-year undeclared war which has killed 2,000 people.
Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the
first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be
resolved with the help of 'political measures and actions'.
South Ossetia is part of Georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring North
Ossetia, which was assigned to Russia by Stalin. Hundreds have been killed
since 1990 in fighting between Georgians and Ossetians.
The peace-keepers have been issued with UN-style light-blue helmet bands and
matching chevrons on their sleeves.
They will be joined later by a multi-ethnic force - Russians, Ukrainians,
Ossetians and other mountain peoples - under the nominal command of North
Ossetian leaders.
The peace-keepers' mission is to form a physical barrier between the two
sides, opening the way to future talks.
The greatest threat is expected to come from hundreds of armed fighters on
both sides, operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the
control of either Russian or Georgian authorities.
Interfax news agency said Russia's Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, at
present on a visit to Moldova, proposed a similar peace-keeping operation
there.
