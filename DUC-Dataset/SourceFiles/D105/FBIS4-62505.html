    Dushanbe 16 May TASS -- The Tajik Communist Party
has called for the restoration of a renovated Soviet Union in 
the form of a federation as the only means to ensure the 
development of the political, economic, and spiritual potential 
of former Soviet republics. 
  Tajik communists' leader Shodiy Shabdolov told ITAR-TASS on 
Monday [16 May]that the disintegration of the Soviet Union and 
the parade of sovereignty that followed it have led to economic 
and political chaos in all republics. Radical market reforms 
"imposed by quasi- democrats" and "wild privatisation" have 
enriched a small group of nouveau riches and plunged the rest of 
the population in poverty and hunger, he said. 
  The mass drive for sovereignty was accompanied by armed 
inter-ethnic conflicts in many ex-Soviet republics and outburst 
of nationalism. Tajikistan was hit most hard. The civil war in 
the Republic claimed the lives of more than 100,000 people, 
Shabdolov said. 
  He noted that the majority of the population support Tajik 
communists' call for the restoration of the Soviet Union. Over 
one million people, about two-thirds of the adult population, 
signed appeals "for unity, brotherhood and friendship of the 
peoples of the USSR" adopted by numerous conferences and 
meetings held all across the Republic. 
  Supporters of the restoration of a renovated union held a 
founding congress of their movement in Dushanbe on Saturday. 
Apart from the communist party, the founders of the new 
movement include Tajik trade unions, the Union of Tajik Women, 
organisations of veterans and ethnic and cultural associations. 
  "We are confident that our movement is growing so strong 
that 
it cannot be stopped," Shabdolov said. He stressed that it will 
act within the framework of the law and use only constitutional 
methods. "We are against barricades and use of force," he said.
