    Russia sends troops to Caucasus to back North Ossetian
regime.

    RUSSIA flew 3,000 special forces to halt ethnic fighting in the troubled
Caucasus mountains at the weekend, its second troop deployment in a week to
support a beleaguered government in its former empire.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent Spetsnaz commandos and elite police to
Vladikavkaz, capital of the Russian autonomous republic of North Ossetia,
1,100 miles south of Moscow. The troops were sent to halt fighting between
Ossetians and a regional ethnic group, the Ingush, who officials claimed
were setting fire to Ossetian-owned homes. Scores were reported killed and
injured in street fighting between Ossetians and Ingush in the past several
days.
Ingush rebels were reported yesterday to have taken hostage 80 Russian
interior ministry soldiers based in the region. A local official said the
soldiers were seized on Friday in the Dzhermen settlement, located near the
regional capital, Vladikavkaz, and populated mostly by Ingushis, Mr Felix
Gutnov, spokesman for the North Ossetian interior ministry, said.
The Ingush, who declared an independent state in June, are demanding the
return of lands that Russian leader Josef Stalin expropriated in 1944 and
declared part of North Ossetia.
Mr Yeltsin and Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar held emergency meetings
on the crisis on Saturday and yesterday. At the same time, the North
Ossetian government said it would distribute Russian army-supplied automatic
weapons to civilian volunteers.
'The Russian authorities are strong enough to make all those violating the
law respect it,' Russian Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Khizha, Mr Yeltsin's
specialist on the Caucasus, told Russian television.
The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet
republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed. The
Central Asian nation, which has yet to form its own army since the Soviet
Union collapsed last December, has also distributed weapons to civilians. On
October 26-27 Russian soldiers played a crucial role in crushing a coup
attempt in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.
The Caucasus mountains, which stretch from southern Russia to the borders of
Turkey and Iran, are engulfed by several conflicts. Among them are Georgia's
war with Abkhazian separatists, and Azerbaijan's conflict with ethnic
Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh.
