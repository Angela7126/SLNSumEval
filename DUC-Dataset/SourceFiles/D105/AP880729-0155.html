    Gorbachev Proposes Tougher Legislation to Punish Promoters of
Nationalism.
   </title>
   <text>
    Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday proposed tougher
legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest,
saying ``nationalist passions'' benefit opponents of his reforms.
   The Soviet leader told a meeting of the Communist Party
leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening in some
regions of the country, due in part to ``active resistance put up
to perestroika by corrupt groups.''
   ``Perestroika,'' or restructuring, is Gorbachev's program for
widespread economic and social change.
   State-run media also indicated Friday that a crackdown had begun
on people in Armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a
mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
The six-month conflict between the two republics over control of
the Nagorno-Karabakh district has led to mass rallies, strikes and
ethnic violence since February.
   The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive
body, intervened July 18. It rejected any change in
Nagorno-Karabakh's status but called for measures to develop the
region's economy and culture.
   The conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh is one of the most rancorous
domestic disputes faced by Gorbachev since he became Communist
Party chief in March 1985. He indicated Friday he wants to defuse
tensions between ethnic groups, but also to punish those who
transform the tensions into a political crisis.
   Gorbachev spoke before a plenary meeting of the Central
Committee, the party's policy-making body. A summary of his remarks
was distributed by the official Tass news agency.
   Gorbachev outlined the reasons for a ``current aggravation'' of
tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the Soviet Union,
Tass said.
   Among the causes, Gorbachev listed ``a lack of concern for many
years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups,
inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive
personnel, and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt
groups.''
   Tass said that after Gorbachev noted that ``nationalist passions
benefit all anti-perestroika forces,'' he suggested increasing
accountability in Soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife.
   Tass did not give details of Gorbachev's suggestion. At the July
18 Presidium meeting, the Soviet leader accused corrupt
conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the
Nagorno-Karabakh annexation drive.
   Gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly
from Article 36 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which says the law
can punish ``any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness,
hostility or contempt.''
   Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve
ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the
country's 15 republics, a law on ``equal use'' of the more than 100
languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for
the country's republics and regions.
   In particular, the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia, forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, have
demanded more say in their own economic and government affairs.
   The labor newspaper Trud said 44 people in Yerevan, Armenia's
capital, will face criminal charges following an incident in which
activists seeking the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh attached
slogans to their cars and drove around the city. The paper did not
give the date or size of the mobile demonstration, but said 155
drivers have had their licenses revoked and 310 were fined.
   In its July 18th decision, the Presidium also ordered local law
enforcement agencies to ensure order was restored in the Caucasus
Mountain region. Tass reported Friday that the situation was
stabilizing in Armenia, but said that at the ``urging of
instigators,'' some strikes and protests were continuing.
