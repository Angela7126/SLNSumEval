    Shooting threatens Moldova peace.

    A CEASEFIRE in Moldova was threatened yesterday when a truck driver
transporting militiamen was shot dead by machinegun fire in the
self-proclaimed Trans Dnestr republic, home of the Russian-speaking
minority.
The shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the
Moldovan authorities, dominated by ethnic Romanians, and the minority based
in the republic on the east bank of the river Dnestr. At least nine people
have been killed in clashes over the past week.
As in the more severe conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the underlying tensions
are growing and neither side believes it is losing. In other respects,
however, the conflicts are quite different and illustrate the complexity of
conflict with which the former Soviet Union is now faced.
The Trans Dnestr conflict stems directly from the breakup of the Soviet
Union while Nagorno-Karabakh has been a source of tension between Azeris and
Armenians for centuries.
Moldova (formerly Moldavia) was finally taken under full Soviet control in
1944.
The Soviet leadership sought to stifle any attempts to preserve its former
links with Romania - calling Moldovan a separate language from Romanian, and
constructing a separate history for the Moldovan people.
Industry was largely situated on the left bank of the Dnestr, in the sliver
of the republic next to Ukraine, and largely staffed by Russians and
Ukrainians. Ukrainians and Russians together represent some 27 per cent of
the population, with Moldovans accounting for 64 per cent.
The little republic (4.5m people) was slow to respond to the stirrings of
reform. When it did, in 1989, a language movement quickly put the hardline
Communist Party on the defensive and it lost power in 1990 to the present
nationalist government, headed by President Mircea Snegur, the former
secretary of the Moldovan Party's central committee.
From the beginning of the nationalist movement, it was clear that the
Russian and, to a lesser extent, the Ukrainian minorities would be hostile,
reacting to laws establishing Moldovan as the official language and to calls
for renewed union with Romania with strikes and demonstrations, and, finally
last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent under a Russian president,
Mr Igor Smirnov.
During the August coup last year, the Moldovan government stoutly rejected
it and the Trans Dnestr authorities welcomed it, siding with the Soviet army
in its brief efforts to impose military rule.
Thereafter, the two sides have gathered military forces. The Trans Dnestr
side has been augmented by Cossacks from nearby areas returning to their
traditional role as defenders of Russia's borders. The daily Izvestia
reported yesterday that the Cossacks appear to have appointed themselves
mercenaries for the Russians (they are paid from Rbs2,000 to Rbs5,000 a week
by the Trans Dnestr authorities).
