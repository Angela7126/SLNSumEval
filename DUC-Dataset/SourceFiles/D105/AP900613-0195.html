    Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885
this month in the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, the official
news agency Tass said Wednesday.
   Tass said 748 of the injured had to be hospitalized and said a
search was continuing for a police officer who vanished June 7.
   No new outbreaks were reported in the region near the border
city of Osh in western Kirghizia, where clashes arising from a land
dispute began on June 2 between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both
Sunni Moslems.
   The argument involves allocation of land in a densly populated
region where housing is scarce. It was the latest in a series of
bloody civil conflicts to trouble President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
government.
   Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief of the Interior Ministry's
Political Department, said that in two years of civil strife _
mainly ethnic clashes _ in the Soviet Union, about 24,000 people
have been arrested.
   He said in Moscow on Tuesday that ministry troops had to be used
in 13 regions of the Soviet Union because of such outbreaks, Tass
said.
   Grienko said 16 ministry soldiers were killed, four were
reported missing and more than 1,000 wounded. Tass did not quote
Grienko on how civilians casualties.
   The general was quoted as saying these conflicts ``were often
accompanied by riots and pogroms, arson and massacre of innocent
people, (and) complete or partial destabilization of the
situation.''
   Besides unrest this month in Kirghizia and Uzbekistan, ethnic
violence also has been reported in recent years in Georgia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan.
