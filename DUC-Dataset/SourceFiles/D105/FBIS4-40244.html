    Alksnis Warns of Ethnic Cleansing in Latvia.
   </title>
   <text>
    Viktor Alksnis, former USSR Supreme Soviet deputy,
today reminded us of his existence. 
  [Correspondent Irina Zaytseva] Viktor Alksnis, born 1950, 
Latvian, former deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the former USSR, 
soldier, resigned from the Army in order to fight for the 
restoration of the USSR. During the October events he left the 
White House with a head wound and was taken to hospital. 
  After a long interval Viktor Alksnis held a news conference 
today in the Slavjanskaya Hotel. He began it with a short 
statement, the essence of which comes down to the fact that the 
adoption of the Latvian citizenship law violates not only human 
rights, but creates the conditions for a conflict similar, in 
his opinion, to the ones in Yugoslavia and the Caucasus. It was 
not only the Latvian Government Alksnis accused of this, but 
also the United States. According to him, during the latest 
visit to the United States by [Latvian President] Guntis 
Ulmanis, sanction was obtained for the adoption of the 
aforementioned discriminatory law. 
  [Begin Alksnis recording] And thus carte blanche was given 
for mild ethnic cleansing of the Russian speaking population of 
the republic. [end recording] 
  [Zaytseva] Apart from that, Alksnis added, according to 
information received from reliable sources, certain circles in 
Moscow want conflict in Latvia. 
  [Begin Alksnis recording] A certain scenario exists to drive 
a so-called security corridor along the route 
Daugavpils-Yekabpils-Riga where stringent ethnic cleansing of 
the Latvian population will take place in reply to the mild 
ethnic cleansing of the Russian population in order to bring 
so-called independent Latvia to its knees. [end recording] 
  [Zaytseva] Journalists asked for more precise information 
about what Alksnis called reliable sources. 
  [Begin Alksnis recording] You understand that I cannot name 
these sources. But I can say that they are fairly 
authoritative. [end recording] 
  [Zaytseva] Asked what he intends to do, Alksnis said his 
opportunities are unfortunately limited, and that is why he is 
appealing to journalists. In his opinion, only joint efforts 
can bring this information to the attention of world public 
opinion, point out the seriousness of this issue, and avoid the 
coming tragedy.
