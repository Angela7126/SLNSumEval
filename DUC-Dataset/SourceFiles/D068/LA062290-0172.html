    CHECKPOINT CHARLIE COMES IN FROM COLD WAR ERA.
   </title>
   <text>
    <p>
     Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall border post that symbolized the Cold War, 
was hoisted into history today.
    </p>
    <p>
     As a brass band played and foreign ministers of the four World War II allies 
watched, a crane lifted the prefabricated hut with its American, British and 
French flags and placed it on a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum.
    </p>

     Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in the middle of the Friedrichstrasse 
boulevard after Communist East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a 
flood of refugees to the enclave of West Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that Berlin should remain 
one city and travel within it should be free," British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd said in a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We always hoped that one day Checkpoint Charlie would no longer be needed, and 
now that day has arrived. At long last, we are bringing Charlie in from the 
cold," he added.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze attended the ceremony in a 
gesture of reconciliation with the Western members of the wartime alliance: 
Britain, France and the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shevardnadze, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit West Berlin, noted 
that the checkpoint was vanishing on the 49th anniversary of the Nazi invasion 
of the Soviet Union.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The closing of this checkpoint offers further proof of a turn for the better 
in the international arena, for overcoming the legacy of confrontation," he 
said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Foreign ministers Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany and Markus Meckel of 
East Germany also attended the ceremony. Genscher thanked Moscow for reform 
policies that had ended "a time of trouble" in Berlin and opened the door to 
unity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hundreds of excited Berliners leaned from balconies and windows today to cheer 
Charlie's exit, snapping pictures and clapping in rhythm with the band as the 
crane pried the hut from its moorings and swung it away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who emotionally challenged the 
building of the wall as mayor of West Berlin in the early 1960s, was in the 
front row of an invited audience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Afterward, souvenir hunters ran up and snatched cobblestones that had served as 
Checkpoint Charlie's foundation.
