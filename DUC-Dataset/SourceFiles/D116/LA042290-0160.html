    SHUTTLE COUNTDOWN RESUMES FOR HUBBLE TELESCOPE MISSION.

     Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discovery's delayed 
launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.

     Engineers also readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad today 
for a May flight.

     Discovery's carefully scripted countdown began on time at 3 p.m. The ship's 
five-member crew is set to blast off at 5:31 a.m. PDT Tuesday, 14 days after 
the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty hydraulic 
power steering unit.

     "We're off and running," NASA spokesman George Diller said. "We're still 80% go 
for launch weather-wise."

     With Discovery's launch processing on track, engineers worked to ready Columbia 
for its May 16 Spacelab astronomy mission.

     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not had two shuttles on 
the launch pad since Columbia took off Jan. 12, 1986, with Challenger poised on 
a pad 1.7 miles away.
    </p>

     Columbia's 3.5-mile trip to the firing stand was set to begin at 8 a.m. today. 
Five hours later, Discovery's five-member crew was scheduled to fly in from the 
Johnson Space Center in Houston to make final preparations for launch.

     Commander Loren J. Shriver, 45; co-pilot Charles F. Bolden, 43; Steven A. 
Hawley, 38; Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38, plan to launch 
the telescope Wednesday.

     Discovery's replacement auxiliary power unit was successfully test fired 
Wednesday and the battery charging for the telescope was completed Thursday, 
one day ahead of schedule.
