    Space Telescope Resumes Operations; Shuttle Crew Prepares for
Landing.

    The Hubble Space Telescope was
awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without
the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments
were on hold, unable to begin any observations.
   ``We are out of the `safe-mode' right now,'' said Steve Terry, a
supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope. He said the
telescope was running on a ``normal control-all mode,'' where its
own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.
   Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a
return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth
and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight.
   Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the
widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected
eventually to look back 14 billion light years _ nearly to the
birth of the universe.
   ``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard
of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' said Bolden. ``It makes little
kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want to learn how to add
and subtract and study science.''
   The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been
in a ``safe mode'' with all motion stopped because of earlier
problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay
satellite. The antennas are the primary links for relaying
scientific data to the ground.
   Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders
in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and
that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas
are working properly.
   ``We expect to use that data to investigate what happened,'' he
said. Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its
secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for
scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.
   ``We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in
effect a standby mode,'' he said.
   Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands
that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run
a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.
   It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is
operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup
process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.
   ``We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful
approach to these problems,'' Olivier said Friday. ``This is not
the time to do anything dumb.''
   The telescope problems have put the flight center several days
behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week
were sticking to their schedule.
   Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close
watch on the weather.
   Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.
Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at
touchdown.
   The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days
beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.
   Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT
today by playing the song, ``Cosmos.''
   ``Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for
today,'' said Commander Loren Shriver.
   ``The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope,
which is now open for business,'' said Mission Control commentator
James Hartsfield.
   The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and
photography today and pack for the trip home. They also planned to
hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson
Space Center.
   Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of
tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were
ready for return to Earth.
   The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close
to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture
door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan
were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in
orbit 380 miles above Earth.
   But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday
morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to
starlight for the first time.
   Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped
working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on
line. The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too,
kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director
of orbital verifications at Goddard.
   A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at
conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many
malfunctions. There also were two communications outages totaling
several hours.
   Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the master of
its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting communications
system is lost for extended periods, Terry said.
   NASA had planned to release its first test image from the
telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the
constellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed because
of the antenna problems. Scientific data will follow in a month or
two.
   The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look
back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the
universe.
   The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion
years ago in a cosmic explosion.
   Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.
He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and
that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving
away.
