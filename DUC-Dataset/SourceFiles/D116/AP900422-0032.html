    Discovery's Astronauts Back for Second Try.

    Discovery's five astronauts returned
Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most
valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope.
   Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
   ``We feel very confident that things are going to go well this
time,'' said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver.
   ``We're going to come out OK on Tuesday morning and, if not,
we'll just keep trying until we do. That's kind of the name of the
game here,'' Shriver said.
   NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday that the countdown
was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect
condition. The countdown got under way Saturday afternoon.
   A faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff April 10. The unit was
replaced with a new one, which tests showed to be fine.
   ``Hopefully, we'll get the shuttle off the pad this time,''
Leinbach said.
   A 70 percent chance of favorable weather was expected at launch
time, with low clouds being the main concern, said the Air Force's
Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front from the
north was expected to pass through the area by Monday night.
   The outlook is considerably better for Wednesday and Thursday,
Priselac said.
   As Discovery's astronauts arrived from Johnson Space Center in
Houston early Sunday afternoon, the shuttle Columbia was being
transported to a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery.
   It is only the second time both shuttle launch pads at Kennedy
Space Center have been occupied simultaneously. The first time was
in January 1986; 16 days after Columbia lifted off, Challenger
exploded.
   Columbia commander Vance Brand said he does not believe the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration is moving too fast
with his shuttle. NASA expects to launch Columbia with an
astronomical observatory called Astro no earlier than May 16, one
week later than planned because of Discovery's two-week delay.
   ``In some cases, it could be a problem'' having shuttles on both
launch pads, Brand said. ``In this particular case, everything's
fitting together.''
   NASA has until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground. After
that, all launch attempts must be halted for eight days so Hubble's
batteries can be recharged.
   The six nickel-hydrogen batteries will power Hubble from the
time it is disconnected from Discovery's electrical system until
its two energy-collecting solar panels take over in space.
   Discovery's payload bay was sealed late Saturday night,
drastically reducing the risk of contamination to the telescope's
finely polished 94.5-inch mirror.
   Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a
shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper
orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. During Hubble's
15-year journey through space, astronomers expect to look back to
nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universe's most
perplexing mysteries.
   Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by Hubble
and thus provide additional targets for the telescope. The $100
million observatory also will focus during Columbia's nine-day
mission on Comet Austin, believed to be on its first trip through
the solar system.
   Both Hubble and Astro were scheduled for launch in 1986, but
were delayed by the Challenger accident.
