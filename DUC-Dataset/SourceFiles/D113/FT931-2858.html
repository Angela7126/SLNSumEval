    World Stock Markets: Bombs rock Bombay in budget aftermath -
RC Murthy on a market which has seen speculation, and savage disappointment.

    The 29-storey Jijobhoy Towers, home of the Bombay Stock Exchange, was rocked
by two powerful bombs last Friday, leaving 60 dead and 200 injured. The
market reopened on Monday in an attempt to return to normal.
It has had to compromise - trading has been restricted to an hour a day, and
dealing has moved back to the traditional ring, where it stopped a year ago.
Dealers seemed to like this, the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent on Monday
and Tuesday. But another bomb blast in Calcutta triggered nervous selling
yesterday, and the index came back by 50.62, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,409.23.
All this has taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity
market, over the past six weeks or so, has had to contend first with
unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27,
and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment.
Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, disappointed traders in the
budget at the end of last month. He postponed corporate tax reforms by a
year, denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group. He did
reduce excise and import duties on a broad front, but left out the cement
and steel sectors, where share prices had been boosted by pre-budget
speculation.
To top it all, Dr Singh refused to equate domestic investors with their
overseas counterparts in taxing short-term capital gains. He lowered the tax
to 30 per cent from 65 per cent for expatriate Indians and foreign investors
but for local investors it remained at 44.5 per cent.
Taking the tax concessions for granted, traders had driven up share prices
in February to make a kill later. Instead, the budget turned out to be a
nightmare. While industry and business welcomed the statement which, for
once, did not propose any new tax, Professor Rusi Taraporewala, the stock
market theorist and academic, said a reduction in import duties would leave
corporate profits ex-growth this year.
The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders
sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless
as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low. Overseas investors fuelled the
downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of Reliance Industries,
arbitraging between the share price on the Bombay stock exchange and the
market price of its Euro-issue of global depository receipts (GDRs).
The opportunity arose after a change in Indian regulations which allows
international investors to convert GDRs into the underlying stock. At the
current conversion rate of Rs31 per US dollar, the Reliance GDR fetched
Rs170 per share against the BSE quotation of Rs210.
The BSE 30-share index plunged by more than one-fifth to 2,287 on March 10,
from 2,893 at the post-budget trading session on February 27. Share prices
rebounded last week, taking the index to 2,361 and the uptrend, on balance,
has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on Friday.
Whether or not the surge will turn into a strong rally will depend on the
ability of bulls to maintain their momentum. They are hoping that foreign
portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after
'Black Friday', and the successful sale of Reliance stock on the BSE by
international investors.
The Indian stock markets have been passing through a series of crises since
December, when activists of the Bhartiya Janta party pulled down the Babri
mosque at Ayodhya, sparking off communal riots.
Mr Mark Bulloch of Jardine Fleming takes the domestic political situation in
his stride. 'Nothing dramatic has happened as far as foreign investors are
concerned,' he says. 'They are appraising the political situation.'
In the meantime, there is no compulsion for local investors to sell. In
this, they are more fortunate than they were in previous years, when they
were under pressure to take advantage of a long-term capital gains tax
exemption before the financial year ended in March. The exemption has been
replaced by a flat 20 per cent tax this year which, according to dealers,
puts bulls and bears on an even footing.
