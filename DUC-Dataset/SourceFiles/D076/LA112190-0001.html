    THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN ENGLAND; BUT MARGARET THATCHER WON'T ALWAYS BE PRIME MINISTER.
   </title>

    <p>
     Embattled Margaret Thatcher remains leader of Britain's Conservative Party, and 
so the country's prime minister -- but only barely. She has survived a vote of 
confidence taken by her party colleagues in the House of Commons, winning 204 
votes against 152 for former defense minister Michael Heseltine. But under Tory 
party rules, that margin, representing something less than a ringing 
endorsement, forces Thatcher to face a second round of voting on Tuesday. Other 
candidates could choose to stand against her, perhaps diluting the opposition 
vote and letting her claim the simple majority she needs to stay as party head. 
But her reelection is hardly assured.

     Polls show the Tories would do better in the next national elections with 
someone other than Thatcher leading them. But elections don't have to be called 
until mid-1992; Thatcher's public standing could conceivably increase by then. 
Thatcher has served as PM longer than anyone in this century. She led her party 
to victory in three elections, steered it through the war with Argentina to 
reclaim the Falklands, faced down the miners union in a long strike, moved -- 
often drastically -- to reverse Britain's economic decline and won a prominent 
place on the world stage.

     But 11 1/2 years in office is a long time. Memory and feelings being what they 
are, it is the mistakes and irritations of this long tenure that are more 
likely to be immediately recalled, while its achievements are left to history 
to salute. Thatcher is seen as having become increasingly autocratic at home 
and a somewhat tiresome scold within the European Community. Her government is 
deeply identified with high interest rates, inflation and a flat tax on every 
adult (in place of the property tax) that is generally regarded as hugely 
unfair. Ultimately, in the cold calculus of politics, the question that will 
most decisively sway Conservative MPs is whether they are more likely to win 
the next election with Thatcher at their head or someone else. Next week will 
bring the answer.
