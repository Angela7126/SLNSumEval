    With Thatcher's Demise, US Loses Its Staunchest Ally.
   </title>
   <text>
    For almost a decade, Margaret Thatcher was
regarded at the White House as America's best friend, the trusted
ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of
administration policies.
   Among Western allies, she was alone at Ronald Reagan's side in
1986 in supporting the U.S. bombing of Libya. In the Persian Gulf
crisis, she boldly joined with George Bush in sending troops to the
Middle East.
   ``You always know where she was and what she believed,'' Bush
said upon hearing of her decision to resign. ``She has always been
an outstanding ally of the United States,'' he said. ``I will miss
her.''
   There were many doubters around the world when Reagan arrived in
Washington with an economic program of free-market capitalism that
seemed out of step with the times. Mrs. Thatcher wasn't one of the
skeptics; she was advocating a similar program at home.
   They shared rocky relations with organized labor. Reagan
successfully fired the nation's air traffic controllers, dealing a
devastating blow to labor. She, too, smashed restive unions.
   On foreign policy, she frequently was more right wing than
Reagan - certainly more so than Bush.
   Reagan never made any secret of his special affection for the
British prime minister. They were ideological soulmates and called
each other Ronnie and Margaret. At international gatherings, they
usually were side by side.
   Two years ago as they met for the final time before Reagan left
office, the president said he was leaving the White House with
``considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher
will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.''
   She later wrote him a ``Dear Ron'' letter in which she praised
him as ``a great president, one of the greatest.''
   Like Reagan, she was deeply suspicious of the Soviet Union.
Together they advocated a hard line toward Moscow and championed
military readiness - even though she was the first to recognize
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a leader she could do business with.
   Mrs. Thatcher encouraged the huge Pentagon buildup that Reagan
nurtured under the theme of peace through strength. She was a big
backer of U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe
and always seemed cautious - perhaps reluctant - when it came to
disarmament.
   When Argentina and Britain clashed militarily over the Falkland
Islands, the United States was forced to make a painful choice
between two allies. Ronnie sided with Margaret.
   Washington's special relationship with London seemed to slip
when Reagan left power. Bush and Mrs. Thatcher disagreed publicly
last year over her government's decision to deport Vietnamese and
Cambodian ``boat people'' who were fleeing their countries to Hong
Kong.
   Bush, a veteran of world politics, knew many leaders around the
globe. Mrs. Thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang.
   The Berlin Wall was collapsing and it appeared as if Bush found
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl more interesting than Mrs. Thatcher.
She was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got the
prized invitation to visit Bush at Camp David this year.
   Nevertheless, Bush said he expected the ``special relationship''
between the United States and Great Britain to remain on a ``steady
keel.''
   Mrs. Thatcher did her part, demonstrating her loyalty. For
awhile she and Bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions of
Gorbachev's unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in Europe, and
appeared uncertain how to respond.
   Under intense pressure from Congress, Bush began to warm to the
Soviet leader. Now they seem almost best of friends.
   On the Persian Gulf, Bush said he would not rule out possible
military force, and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his
threat credible. Mrs. Thatcher, characteristically, was tougher.
   She said that unless Saddam Hussein got out of Kuwait soon, the
West would have to use military force to dislodge him.
   She called Saddam ``a loser,'' and the state-controlled Iraqi
news agency replied that she was an ``old hag.''
   Now, she is leaving. No one suspects that Britain's new
leadership - whoever it is - will take a soft line toward Iraq.
Yet, if the going gets tough, it might have been comforting for
Bush to be able to hear the tough old line from Thatcher.
