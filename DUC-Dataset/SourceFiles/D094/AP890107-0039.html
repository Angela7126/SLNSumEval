    Most Of World, Except Asian Opponents, Mourn Hirohito's Death.
   </title>
   <text>
    World leaders from President Reagan to Malaysia's king mourned
today's death of Emperor Hirohito, who surrendered a broken nation
to the Allies in World War II but presided over its rise to economic
pre-eminence.
   Reaction to Hirohito's death at age 87, however, was decidedly
cool in several Asian countries, including South Korea, which
endured years of harsh colonial rule by Japan.
   While South Korea President Roh Tae-Woo sent his condolences, a
government party statement added, ``We reserve further comment,
considering the unhappy past and the current Korea-Japan
relationship.''
   The main opposition party led by Kim Dae-jung said, ``We have
complex feelings at the death of Hirohito in view of Japan's 20-year
rule over Korea during his reign.''
   A leading newspaper in Seoul, The Joong-Ang Daily News, wrote
that Hirohito's death ``reminds all the Korean people of a disgraced
period and ... humiliation. ... Hirohito is the symbolic figure who
must assume most and final responsibility for (Japan's) preposterous
crimes to the Korean people.''
   Korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalist
south in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's rule that
began in 1910 with Japan's forced annexation of the peninsula.
   There was no official comment from the nationalist Chinese
government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between
Taiwan and Japan, but the mass circulation Chinese daily United
Evening News said:
   ``Asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of
Japan's militarists during World War II may bury their animosity
with Hirohito's death. ... Chinese suffered the most from the
Japanese invasion.
   ``It was an irony that while Hirohito apologized to the United
States and Europe for the war, he did not direct a single word to
China to show his sorrow.Now, Hirohito has died. We may not want to
collect the reparations, but we shall never forget the painful
historic lessions.''
   In the United States, President Reagan said in a statement, ``His
Majesty's 62-year reign spanned one of the most tumultuous, and yet
at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind _ an
age of unprecedented economic collapse, a most vicious war,
astonishing scientific acheivement, and dramatic political and
social changes throughout the world.
   ``It was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation. His Majesty
played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two
peoples to an end,'' Reagan said, referring to Hirohito's decision
to end World War II.
   In New Zealand, Prime Minister David Lange said Hirohito's death
marks the end of an era.
   ``During his reign he saw the transition from the most turbulent
period in Japan's modern history to the stability and prosperity of
today,'' Lange said.
   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines sent condolences to
the imperial family and her foreign secretary, Raul Manglapus, a
Japanese prisoner of war during World War II, praised Hirohito as
``a stabilizing factor'' in the creation of a democratic Japan.
   ``He provided a figurehead that kept the Japanese people firmly
committed to peaceful means of achieving their national goals,''
Manglapus said.
   Condolences also came from King Sultan Mahmood Iskandar of
Malaysia to Hirohito's oldest son, Crown Prince Akihito, who
immediately ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia paid his respects in a
message to Japanese Prime Minister Noburu Takeshita: ``Throughout
his long life, the emperor was held in the highest esteem by his
people. Now, as Japan enters a period of mourning and prepares for a
new age, our thoughts are with you.''
   But Bruce Ruxton, an official of the Returned Services League,
which representing almost 300,000 Australian war veterans, said
there would not ``be too many tears shed around the world.'' He
described Hirohito, whose role in the war has been debated, as ``one
of the worst war criminals.''
   Marine biologists paid homage to another facet of the monarch's
life _ his 12 books published on hydrozoa, or sea animals. Robert
Hessler of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., said Hirohito preferred the quiet study to his destined role
as leader.
   ``The poor man didn't really get to do what he wanted to do. He
had to be emperor first, then second a scientist and normal human
being,'' Hessler said.
