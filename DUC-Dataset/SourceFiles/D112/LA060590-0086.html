    MAXWELL SEEKS TO BUY BIG U.S. NEWSPAPER.

     British media entrepreneur Robert Maxwell said Monday that he is involved in 
negotiations to buy a U.S. newspaper valued "in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
     Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but his comments prompted industry 
speculation that it might be Gannett's USA Today, Tribune Co.'s New York Daily 
News or the Chicago Sun-Times.
    </p>
    <p>
     Officials of each of those newspapers denied that they were negotiating with 
Maxwell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maxwell's comments were made to reporters at the annual meeting in New York of 
Maxwell's Berlitz International and were confirmed later by a spokesman for 
Maxwell Communications, the investor's London-based holding company. The 
spokesman declined to elaborate on the remarks, and said Maxwell had left the 
United States.

     The Daily News has one of the United States' largest circulations, but in 
recent years it has struggled to restore profitability and maintain circulation 
in a market with three other dailies. The paper is conducting difficult labor 
contract negotiations with its unions.
    </p>

     Some analysts said it might make sense for Maxwell to try to purchase USA 
Today, since it would mesh well with his efforts to print and distribute his 
month-old "pan-European" English-language paper, The European, in this country. 
Maxwell has already been in negotiations with USA Today officials about 
printing the paper for U.S. distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other industry officials conjectured that Maxwell might be talking to the 
Chicago Sun-Times, which has seen daily circulation slide more than 100,000 
papers, to about 533,000, since 1985.
    </p>

     Maxwell, who publishes Britain's Daily Mirror, recently bought three U.S. 
supermarket tabloids, the Globe, National Examiner and the Sun, for an 
estimated $100 million.
