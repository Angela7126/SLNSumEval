    LONDON -- Following his takeover of the unprofitable New
York Daily News, British publisher Robert Maxwell plans to
raise around #250 million ($448 million) through the sale of
shares in his Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd. of Britain.
   In a flotation organized by Samuel Montagu &amp; Co., Mirror
is to sell 45% to 49% of its shares to investors in Britain
and abroad. Terms will be set April 30. The offering is
expected to value Mirror Group at more than #500 million.

    Mirror's flagship publication is the tabloid Daily Mirror,
with sales of three million copies daily.
   Last month, in another money-raising move, Mr. Maxwell's
Maxwell Communication Corp. sold its Pergamon Press PLC unit
for #440 million.
   In other changes, Mr. Maxwell's son Ian, who has been
appointed deputy chairman of Mirror Group, will resign from
his post at Maxwell Communication, where he was joint deputy
managing director. Maxwell Communication said last month that
its management would be taken over by Kevin Maxwell, Ian's
brother.
   Robert Maxwell bought Mirror Group in 1984 from Reed
International PLC for #113 million. Through staff cuts and
heavy spending on printing facilities, Mr. Maxwell built
Mirror into one of Britain's most profitable newspaper
groups. In 1990, Mirror had profit of #37.2 million, or 28.2
pence a share, on revenue of #445 million.
   Proceeds from the share flotation will be used to
strengthen and refinance the group's balance sheet. About
#210 million will be used to pay back bank loans and the rest
to pay in full a loan from Robert Maxwell Holdings Ltd.
   Salomon Bros. International is underwriting the
international part of the offering, covering approximately
one-third of the shares on sale, to be privately placed with
institutional investors in the U.S., Canada and Europe.
   The other two-thirds of the shares are to be divided
between private and institutional investors in Britain. A
relatively low minimum-investment figure of #250 has been set
to attract small investors, particularly readers of Mirror
publications.
