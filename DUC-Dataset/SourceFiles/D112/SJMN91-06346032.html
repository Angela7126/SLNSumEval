    A son of the late publishing magnate Robert Maxwell thinks there is no chance
Maxwell employees will recover any of the hundreds of millions of dollars in
pension funds that disappeared, a report said today.;   Kevin Maxwell also was
quoted as saying that much of the criticism calling his father a crook is fair
and that there's "not the remotest possibility" his father's death a month ago
was a suicide.

    Investigators have said Maxwell siphoned money from his companies in a
desperate attempt to deal with his empire's crushing debts. They also have
said some questionable transactions may have occurred after Maxwell's death.; 
 In an interview published today by the Daily Mirror, Robert Maxwell's London
flagship newspaper, Kevin Maxwell was quoted as saying of the pensioners:;  
"I am desperately sorry for them. But I have to be honest. The debts are so
enormous that when everything is sorted out there will be nothing left.";  
One week ago, the Serious Fraud Office, a government prosecution agency, began
investigating Mirror Group Newspapers PLC's pension fund assets and related
matters. The company says about $630 million was taken from its pension fund
without authority.;   Kevin Maxwell spoke with the Daily Mirror as he flew to
New York on Tuesday for talks on the future of the Daily News, which his
father bought in March. Kevin Maxwell is now the publisher.;   In a report
today, The Washington Post quoted unidentified sources as saying Robert
Maxwell never created the pension fund for Daily News managers he promised to
start with funding from Tribune Co., which sold the paper to Maxwell. Pension
money accumulated before the sale wasn't affected, it said.;   Revelations of
Maxwell's financial manipulations have led to numerous newspaper
characterizations of him as a crook.;   "I have to say to myself that given
the sequence of events and looking at the whole picture, that a lot of it is
fair comment," Kevin Maxwell was quoted as saying by the Daily Mirror.;  
Asked how he thought his father died, he was quoted as saying: "Suicide? Not
the remotest possibility.";   Maxwell's body was found in the sea off the
Canary Islands on Nov. 5. He had been cruising on his yacht. Preliminary
findings by Spanish pathologists indicated he could have fallen into the sea
after a heart attack.;   Kevin Maxwell has been linked to transactions of a
pension fund management firm at the center of the controversy over the missing
money, investigators say. He and brother Ian are under court order to disclose
by next week what they know about the affairs of Bishopsgate Investment
Management Ltd., one of about 40 companies controlled by their father.;   In
another development, The Financial Times said today that documents show
creditors face losses of at least $905 million on loans to Robert Maxwell's
private companies.
