    Robert Maxwell, the flamboyant billionaire who built a global publishing
empire, was found dead Tuesday in waters off the Canary Islands, where he had
been vacationing on his yacht.;   Authorities said Maxwell, 68, who earlier
this year had bought the New York Daily News, vanished overnight from the
180-foot Lady Ghislaine. His unclothed body was found several hours later.

    Maxwell's death ended the reign of a contentious media baron who battled
unions, barked out orders in eight languages and bullied editors as he built a
$2 billion media conglomerate.;   "He was larger than life ... the Citizen
Kane of his time," said British Conservative Party lawmaker Anthony
Beaumont-Dark, referring to Orson Welles' classic movie about a publishing
baron, presumed to have been William Randolph Hearst. "If you wrote a film
about his life, it would be rejected as unrealistic.";   A labor union leader
once said Maxwell "could charm the birds out of the trees. And then shoot
them.";   The Czechoslovak-born Maxwell, who escaped the Holocaust and
emigrated to Britain in 1940, personally ran his publishing empire, often
making minute-to-minute decisions. Maxwell's sons, Kevin, 32, and Ian, 35,
took over running the businesses Tuesday.;   "What normal people consider
pressure was meat and drink to Robert Maxwell," said Charles Wilson, editorial
director of Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers.;   His death prompted immediate
concern in British financial circles about the future of his debt-laden empire
and in New York about the future of the Daily News, one of the nation's
largest metropolitan papers.;   Among Maxwell's assets were the Macmillan
publishing house in New York, Britain's No. 2 paper, the Daily Mirror, The
Daily Record, and The European and British Printing &amp; Communications Corp.,
Britain's largest printing company.;   On the steps of Mirror Group Newspapers
in London, Ian Maxwell told reporters the moment was tragic not only for his
family but also for Maxwell's thousands of employees. "This paper has lost its
publisher and its chairman and its savior.";   British Prime Minister John
Major called Maxwell "a great character who will be missed.";   "Maxwell was a
passionate friend of Israel, and we are sorry about this heavy tragedy,"
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said. "God bless his memory.";   His
body was found 20 miles northwest of Grand Canary Island after an extensive
air-and-sea search, officials at the rescue center in Madrid said. The body
was taken by helicopter to the Gando air base on Grand Canary Island, where it
was identified by Maxwell's wife of more than 40 years, Elizabeth, and their
son, Phillip. An autopsy is planned for today, and the cause of death is
officially still unknown.;   Details of Maxwell's death are sketchy. He was
last seen alive on the deck of his yacht at 4:45 a.m. EST, Daily News
spokesman John Campi said. At 11 a.m., a business call arrived from New York,
and the crew discovered that Maxwell was not aboard. Campi said Capt. Gus
Rankin then radioed a distress call. The body was found several hours later.; 
 Wilson said there had been no suggestion of foul play. "We can only assume
that Mr. Maxwell slipped and fell overboard," he said.;   His mysterious death
came as Maxwell was embroiled in an international controversy, something
common in a life that had the improbable, extravagant and sometimes mysterious
character of British fiction.;   Maxwell had just been accused in a book by
reporter Seymour Hersh of having close ties to the Israeli secret service.;  
Maxwell had denied the accusations.
