    $1.5 Billion Eye in the Sky Opens; Astronauts Prepare for Return.
   </title>
   <text>
    The Hubble Space Telescope orbited
with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame
communications problems and lifted its lens cover, but its
electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.
   Those problems, however, were not the immediate concern of
shuttle Discovery's astronauts, who prepared for Sunday's return to
Earth.
   ``You've been released from Hubble support. It's on its own,''
Mission Control's Story Musgrave told the five crew members.
   ``That's great news,'' replied Discovery commander Loren J.
Shriver.
   ``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here. I'll bet
it's just that way back down there, too,'' added mission specialist
Steven Hawley. ``Who's buying tonight?''
   ``We'll buy when you all get back,'' Musgrave replied.
   Flight director William Reeves said it was too early to cheer.
   `We still have an important part of the mission to go,'' Reeves
said. ``We reserve our celebration until the crew is safely on the
ground.''
   Discovery is to land at 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif. Landing would have been delayed a day if
astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had had to perform
a space walk to crank open the telescope's lens cover, or aperture
door.
   The shuttle trailed 50 miles behind Hubble when the aperture
door opened 380 miles above Earth, but passed 3.7 miles beneath the
telescope later in the day.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to
release its first test image from the $1.5 billion telescope on
Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
But Steve Terry, director of orbital verifications, said that would
be delayed by problems with Hubble's high-speed antennas.
Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
   Hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door was opened to the
heavens at 10:30 a.m. EDT, nearly four hours later than planned,
exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for the
first time.
   Ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lift
even though the telescope was in an automatic ``safe mode,'' with
all motion stopped because of problems in linking its high-speed
dish antennas with a relay satellite.
   One of the two antennas apparently had swung too far, and the
telescope shut down, said Jean Oliver, a Hubble deputy project
manager. If future movements of the antenna have to be limited to
avoid the problem, it would have only slight impact on the
telescope's observing time, Oliver said.
   Terry said the opening of the aperture door could not have been
delayed much longer.
   ``There has to be a point where you say they have to go their
way and we have to go ours,'' he said of the astronauts.
   When the door opened, two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing
gyroscopes stopped working; later, engineers got them back on line.
The motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros, said Dave
Drachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. That, too,
kept it in the safe mode.
   Oliver said it would be Saturday morning before the telescope is
brought out of the safe mode. It will take another day to get the
instrument operating normally again, putting controllers at Goddard
several days behind.
   ``We're trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut any
corners and do anything fast because we feel there's a lot at risk
here and we want to make sure we're doing it properly,'' Oliver
said. ``We've got a long future ahead of us, and we want to make
sure it starts off on the right foot.''
   NASA said the telescope was safe and in a stable position.
   Tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularly
narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many
malfunctions, Terry said. In addition to that trouble, there were
two communications outages totaling several hours.
   ``We're cautious, and that's natural,'' Terry said. ``We've got
a very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything
to jeopardize the usefulness. ... We'll get to the point where we
know exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits
appropriately.''
   Terry said Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the
master of its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting
communications system is lost for extended periods. The telescope
will share the system, known as Tracking and Data Relay Satellites,
with other space craft.
   Except for a tiny wedge opening, the lens cover had been closed
and the telescope blind ever since Hubble was released by the
astronauts Wednesday.
   From its orbit high above Earth's distorting atmosphere, the
telescope will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime
to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the
universe. The universe is believed to have been created about 15
billion years ago in a cosmic explosion.
   The late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, for whom the telescope is
named, provided the basis for the Big Bang theory of creation. He
discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that
the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away.
   In honor of the astronomer, Sullivan carried with her into space
an eyepiece from the 100-inch telescope at California's Mount
Wilson Observatory that Hubble used to make his pioneering
observations.
   ``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical
significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin
Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' she said Friday
afternoon.
   Once back on Earth, the eyepiece will be displayed at the
observatory.
