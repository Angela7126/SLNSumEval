    Hubble Aperture Door Finally Opened After Morning Of Problems.
   </title>
   <text>
    The lens cover on the Hubble Space
Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and
Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are
needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.
   ``You've been released from Hubble support; it's on its own,''
Mission Control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door
opened.
   ``Thank you, sir, that's great news,'' said Discovery Commander
Loren J. Shriver.
   ``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here,'' said
Steve Hawley, who had been at the controls when the telescope was
released into its own orbit on Wednesday. ``I'll bet it's just that
way down there, too.''
   The successful opening of the lens cover paved the way for the
astronauts to return to Earth on Sunday. They had blasted into
space Tuesday after a two-week delay and dispatched the telescope
from its payload bay Wednesday.
   ``The Hubble is open for business,'' Mission Control told the
astronauts.
   The telescope still was having problems, however. When the door
opened, two of its four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped
working and the electronic system went into an automatic ``safe
mode'' in which all motion is stopped.
   The team at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which
guides the telescope, said the door-opening motion jarred the
telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted
properly in shutting down.
   By early afternoon, a step-by-step procedure was begun to bring
the telescope's electronics back on line.
   Steve Terry, a top Hubble engineering official, said tolerances
for the telescope systems had been set particularly narrow for the
first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions. In
addition to the trouble this morning, there two communications
outages Thursday totaling several hours.
   ``We're cautious, and that's natural,'' he said. ``We've got a
very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything to
jeopardize the usefulness. ... We'll get to the point where we know
exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits
appropriately.''
   NASA announced that ``at this time the telescope is safe,
stable.''
   The space shuttle Discovery, which carried the telescope to
orbit, was 50 miles behind the telescope, ready to lend a hand if
needed. Later in the day, the ship was to do an engine firing that
would set it on a preliminary path for home.
   That path would take the Discovery two miles below the telescope.
   The lens cover, a 10-foot diameter ``aperature door,'' covers
the opening to the telescope's light shield. When it is closed, the
telescope is blind.
   The lens cover had been closed _ except for a tiny wedge opening
_ ever since the $1.5 billion telescope was dropped overboard by
the Discovery crew on Wednesday.
   Now that it is opened, starlight can strike the lens for the
first time and it can go about its business of photographing and
analyzing the universe in ways and with sensitivity never before
possible.
   The door is made from honeycombed aluminum sheets covered on the
outside with solar-reflecting material. The inside is painted black
to absorb stray light.
   If the door opening command had failed, the five Discovery
astronauts who deployed Hubble were prepared to head back to the
telescope. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn
Sullivan would have performed a space walk to open the door
Saturday if necessary.
   If it had been needed, the rescue would have delayed the
landing, scheduled for Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., by
a day.
   The astronauts were awakened at 2:30 a.m. EDT to the mellow
sounds of the Beach Boys' song, ``Kokomo.''
   ``For Max Q's keyboard, that's the way that song should really
be done,'' Mission Control radioed to mission specialist Steve
Hawley, a member of the all-astronaut band called Max Q. ``Your
next practice is Sunday evening in the gym, don't be late.''
   Max Q is a NASA acronym for the point in the shuttle's ascent
when the aerodynamic pressure is at its greatest point.
   ``That sounds just like the way we do it,'' replied Hawley. ``If
you get us home by Sunday, I'll go to practice.''
   In an orbit high enough to avoid Earth's distorting atmosphere,
Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so
distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth. It
is capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times
greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
   During its 15-year working lifetime, Hubble is expected to help
determine the age and size of the universe. It may solve the
mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars
with planets that could conceivably support life.
   On Tuesday, NASA plans to release its first test image from the
telescope, an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
Significant data will follow in a month or two.
   The 12{-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is
named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953. The
Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe
is expanding, a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe
was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion.
