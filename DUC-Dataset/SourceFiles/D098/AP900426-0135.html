    Communications Outages Mar Hubble's First Day, But Problem Finally
Solved.
   </title>
   <text>
    Ground controllers at the Goddard
Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main
antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying
for more than six hours to lock on.
   Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md.,
as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was
solved.
   ``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with
the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna
system,'' said NASA's Dave Drachlis.
   Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were
working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing
either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications
satellite that acts as a switchboard.
   In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the
antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2
degrees to 10.8 degrees.
   The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit
information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies,
were working well.
   Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy
certain problems. The outage was not a problem for which space
walkers would have been summoned.
   The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of
storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing
experiments.
   Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of
the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and
was not a serious problem. It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and
lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.
   The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers
attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain
antennas through the TDRS.
   ``This time it was a pointing problem,'' said Jim Elliott, a
Goddard spokesman. ``It's a new spacecraft and we think
inexperience dealing with it was the cause.''
   The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was
released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute
snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.
   Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud
rendition of the song ``Shout,'' a fraternity house favorite.
   ``Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after that
song,'' said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. ``There are a
lot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday and
Hubble had a good night while you were asleep.''
   ``We appreciate the good words from everybody,'' replied
Discovery Commander Loren Shriver.
   After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery
away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of
maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park''
Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
   ``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and
we sure hope it does good work,'' Shriver said Wednesday.
   ``Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work
you've done,'' replied Mission Control. ``Galileo is real proud of
you.''
   Scientists have hailed the Hubble _ NASA's most expensive
unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since
Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
   Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope
while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is
operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.
   The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot
aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished
94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
   Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from
the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
Data will follow in a month or two.
   If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could
return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk
to fix it.
   Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be
tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door
is opened.
   ``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the
Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he
said. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive
instruments.
   On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist
it from the cargo bay.
   One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as
expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries,
which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
   But there was trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budge
when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its
39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way out
on the third attempt.
   By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn
Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away
from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance
call.
   Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
   The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70
miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was
dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting
atmosphere.
   Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the
beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their
light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope to
determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated
at 15 billion years ago.
   The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but
was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
   Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to
land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
