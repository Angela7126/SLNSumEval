    Telescope's Main Antennas Work on Second Try.

    Ground controllers cheered after
re-establishing contact Thursday with the $1.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope through its main antennas.
   An attempt six hours earlier had failed.
   ``I'm pretty relieved, I must say,'' said Al Boggess, Hubble
project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   Applause erupted at Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control
Center when the high-speed contact was made Thursday afternoon.
   Controllers sent information to the telescope about its
location, and ``this basically improved the telescope's knowledge
where it was, what its position was,'' said Goddard's Dave
Drachlis. They also widened the radio beam to cover a larger area
around the two high-speed dish antennas.
   ``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with
the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna
system,'' Drachlis reported.
   The antennas are the primary communications links for relaying
scientific information to the ground.
   Controllers' lack of experience with the new satellite was part
of the problem, Boggess said.
   ``This probably won't be the last time we have a problem,'' he
said. ``We'll keep working at it until we have all these things
that need to be done, done. We'll get them right.''
   The problem began Thursday morning when engineers tried pointing
the two high-speed antennas toward two widely-separated TDRS
satellites without success. Two low-speed antennas were working
fine, but Boggess said they would be ``excruciatingly slow'' for
sending data.
   There had been a communications outage with the telescope
earlier. It lasted only 45 minutes and was due to human error.
   In addition, one of four ``rate gyros,'' wheels whose spin
maintains the telescope in a stable position, was disconnected by
an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain
immediately. But it was restored later and the stability of the
satellite was unaffected.
   The problems won't delay the schedule for putting the telescope
into use, said Jean Oliver, Hubble deputy project manager at
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   ``Now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what
part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do
differently in the future to make it continue to work,'' Boggess
said. ``Having done it once, we've got confidence we can do it and
that means the mission can proceed.''
   Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles behind the telescope
and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door was opened,
set for Friday morning. Its five astronauts spent the day doing
experiments and taking pictures of storms over Texas and other
views of Earth from 380 miles up, the highest a shuttle has ever
flown.
   When the door covering the telescope aperture is opened,
starlight will strike the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch
mirror for the first time.
   If signals fail to activate the 10-foot-wide aluminum aperture
door, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan
will go into open space and crank it open Saturday.
   The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif. The mission would be extended a day if the space walk
became necessary.
   On Tuesday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
releases its first image from the telescope, an open star cluster
in the constellation Carina. Scientific data will follow in a month
or two.
   The 12{-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is
named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953. The
Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe
is expanding, a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe
was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion.
   Astronomers expect to look back 14 billion years with the space
telescope.
