    NASA, Scientists Eagerly Await Second Launch Attempt.
   </title>
   <text>
    Two weeks after a failed launch
attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the
most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space
Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.
   The countdown began Saturday afternoon for a launch set for 8:31
a.m. EDT Tuesday. If the launch goes on schedule and all else goes
well, the first picture from Hubble could be available next weekend.
   ``We are as excited, maybe even more. You can cut it with a
knife, incredible,'' said Eric Chaisson, senior scientist at the
Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore.
   Nothing, at least scientifically, seems to have been lost as a
result of the two-week wait, one of numerous delays plaguing the
mission since its original 1983 launch date.
   As Chaisson remarked last week: ``The universe has been around
for 15 billion years. A couple of weeks is not going to matter.''
   ``The heavens look the same to me. The secrets are the same,''
Chaisson said.
   ``There's not a bit of difference,'' agreed Charles Pellerin
Jr., NASA's director of astrophysics. ``I think the main point is
the Hubble Space Telescope still is in perfect condition.''
   The $1.5 billion telescope, the most expensive unmanned
spacecraft ever built, rests safely inside Discovery's payload bay
awaiting the Tuesday launch.
   If all goes well, Discovery will return to Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., on Sunday, April 29, with an empty payload bay. NASA
said it may release its first telescope image from Hubble _ of an
open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ as early as that
same day.
   After the early test images are made and other preparatory work
is done, Hubble is expected to start providing significant
scientific data by satellite in a month or two.
   The observatory is considered the greatest advance in astronomy
since Galileo first used a telescope in 1609. It also is considered
by many at NASA to be the most important shuttle mission to date;
it will be the 35th.
   The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
who discovered during the 1920s the universe constantly is
expanding. His work gave rise to the theory the universe was
created by a tremendous explosion about 15 billion years ago.
   From its perch far above Earth's obstructing atmosphere, the
telescope will be able to discern objects 50 times fainter and with
10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
   Astronomers are counting on Hubble to unravel some of the
mystery surrounding quasars, pulsars and black holes. By studying
stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to
Earth for 14 billion years, they hope to determine the precise
origin of the universe and learn whether other solar systems _ and
life forms _ exist.
   ``If everything goes well, it's going to knock our socks off,''
Chaisson said.
   NASA's sole attempt to launch Discovery was halted four minutes
before liftoff April 10 when one of the shuttle's three auxiliary
power units failed. The 88-pound unit was replaced with a new one,
the first time NASA ever had installed such a unit at the launch
pad.
   The procedure went so smoothly the space agency decided last
week to advance the launch to Tuesday, a day earlier than planned.
   Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries were returned to the
telescope Friday following 130 hours of recharging. The batteries
will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discovery's
power system until its energy-collecting solar panels are deployed
380 miles above Earth, the highest a shuttle has ever gone.
   Astronaut Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttle's mechanical arm
to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space on the second day of
the mission. The telescope's aperture door will be opened on the
next to allow the first starlight to strike the mirror.
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan,
veteran spacewalkers, will leave the cabin to assist if necessary.
The shuttle will follow Hubble from 40 miles away in case a problem
develops and the telescope must be retrieved and returned to Earth.
   ``You can never eliminate those oddball quirks of fate or
gremlins that may sneak up on any given day,'' Sullivan said. ``But
those are very remote potentials I really suspect we won't
encounter.''
   In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of the telescope, $500
million has been spent to stockpile spare parts, train astronauts
and develop computer software to operate the instrument. The
European Space Agency contributed $250 million to the Hubble
project and will get to use the telescope 15 percent of the time.
