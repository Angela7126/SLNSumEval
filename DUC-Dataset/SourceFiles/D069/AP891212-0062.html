    Party Admits Socialism Failed; Reunification Splits Democracy Movement.
   </title>
   <text>
    The Communist Party today admitted
that East Germany's socialist system has failed, and expressed
support for a type of partnership with West Germany.
   The statement in the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland
was one of the bluntest official assessments to date of the
country's increasingly troubled situation. It came a day after
shouting matches broke out over German reunification during
pro-democracy protests in Leipzig and Dresden.
   Also today, Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged caution
on the reunification issue. He visited the Berlin Wall and met with
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Premier Hans
Modrow.
   In another development, the largest opposition movement, New
Forum, announced it will take part as a political party in the
country's first free elections, scheduled for May 6.
   Neues Deutschland, in proposing a new party platform, said
``socialism has definitely failed as a social system in our
country'' and acknowledged that the ``popular revolutionary
movement'' of the past weeks had led to the scrapping of the old
system.
   The paper repeated the Communists' promise to work for a new
``democratic socialism'' within a multi-party system.
   During the past few weeks, both Germanys have increased business
and cultural ties but have debated what labels to use for closer
relations, since the East Berlin government rejects calls for
reunification.
   Neues Deutschland urged a ``qualified partnership of both German
states'' but rejected any suggestions of resolving the ``German
question.''
   During Monday's demonstrations that drew more than 200,000
protesters, the largest of them the now-weekly rally in the
southern city of Leipzig, speakers warned that the reunification
issue could fracture the popular movement that has forced the
ruling Communists into swift retreat.
   One sign said ``Germany United Fatherland,'' using a phrase from
the West German national anthem.
   Others, opposing reunification, urged ``No Fourth Reich'' and no
transformation of East Germany into West Germany's ``plantation.''
   ADN said 40,000 people demonstrated for reunification in
Karl-Marx-Stadt, while several thousand people split into pro- and
anti-reunification groups at a rally in Dresden.
   Smaller rallies were also reported by ADN in Schwerin, Potsdam,
Neubrandenburg and Halle. The agency did not say if reunification
played a role in those protests.
   The rallies came shortly after the four victorious World War II
Allies met in West Berlin to discuss the latest developments in
East Germany and Berlin _ the divided city that they still
technically administer.
   The meeting brought together officials of the United States,
France and Britain with Soviet officials, who have increasingly
expressed concern over calls in both Germanys to reunite the
country.
   Kohl has advocated a confederation of the two Germanys, to be
followed by eventual reunification. But he stressed to reporters on
Monday that ``the goal of our policies is not to create an
overpowering Germany in the middle of Europe.'' The West German
leader advocates a reunified Germany that would respect the
security needs _ and borders _ of the rest of Europe.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, during a Central
Committee in Moscow on Saturday, urged the West not to try to
influence developments in East Germany. East Germany is a front
line of defense for the Soviets, who have nearly 400,000 troops in
the country.
   ADN said Gorbachev would meet soon with Gregor Gysi, a reformer
who was chosen East German Communist Party chief on Saturday.
   Gysi's rise followed the ouster of two sets of Communist
leaders. Since East Germans began agitating for an end to Communist
domination two months ago, public pressure has forced the opening
of the Berlin Wall and pushed the Communists to promise free
elections and relinquish their political monopoly.
