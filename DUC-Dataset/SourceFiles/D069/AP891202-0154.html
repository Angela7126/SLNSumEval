    West German Leader Tries to Reassure U.S. Senators on NATO.

    Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured
visiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that West
Germany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one of
the senators said Friday.
   ``He strongly affirmed under no circumstances would a reunified
Germany be neutral,'' Sen. Richard G. Lugar, head of the American
delegation, said of the Friday meeting with Kohl.
   Asked whether he thought the West Germans were committed to
staying in the NATO military alliance of Western nations, the
Indiana Republican said: ``Without any reservations.''
   There is growing discussion in West Germany about German
reunification as a result of sweeping social and political reforms
underway in East Germany. There has been speculation that West
Germany might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if the
Kremlin stipulates it as the price for reunification.
   Kohl on Tuesday unveiled a 10-point proposal with German
reunification as its ultimate goal. But the Soviets, who suffered
millions of deaths fighting a unified Germany in World War II, have
said the idea of German reunification is ``dangerous and
unrealistic.''
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are to
begin a shipboard summit off Malta on Saturday. The dramatic events
in East Germany and whirlwind reforms elsewhere in the East bloc
are likely to be a main topic of their talks.
   Lugar came to Bonn with eight other members of the U.S. Senate's
arms control observer group. He said the purpose of the trip was to
``visit with the Germans on their judgments about all of these
procedures that are going on.''
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters joined the senators for their
75-minute closed-door talks with Kohl. The senators also met with
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg during the day.
   Lugar said Kohl told the Americans that reunification would be a
``procedure that depends on many events in Germany and Europe'' and
that the Soviet Union and the United States have a role to play.
   Lugar said of Kohl's proposals, ``There is much to work with
there with regard to the future of Germany and the future of the
(NATO) alliance.''
