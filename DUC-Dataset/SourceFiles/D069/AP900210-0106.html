    Thousands Demonstrate for Unification.

    About 20,000 East Germans, many carrying West
German flags, demonstrated Saturday for speedy German
reunification, the official East German news agency ADN said.
   As the demonstrators rallied in the southern city of Plauen,
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in Moscow that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had given him an unequivocal promise
to respect German reunification. Kohl declared it a ``very good day
for Germany.''
   Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher also disclosed
that they expect a reunification plan with agreement of the World
War II Allies to be ready before the end of the year for
presentation to a pan-European summit meeting.
   Calls for German reunification have increased since the ouster
of the hard-line Communist leadership and the opening of East
Germany's borders during the fall pro-democracy movement.
   Despite reforms, nearly 2,000 East Germans, most of them skilled
workers, continue to leave their homeland daily, crippling an
economy already troubled by strikes and absenteeism.
   Earlier Saturday, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said
the East German economy was in a ``sorrowful state'' and urged the
East German government to release details on its financial
situation.
   Waigel's comments came after a day after a high-ranking official
in Bonn warned that East Germany is rapidly approaching insolvency.
   ``Things are escalating,'' Waigel said in an interview with West
Berlin radio. ``The economy is in a sorrowful state. The political
authority is crumbling.''
   He said the Bonn government believes East Germany's foreign debt
stands at $18 billion.
   ``If the situation has changed, the East German government must
say so,'' said Waigel, a conservative who has been pushing for
establishment of a common currency for the two states.
   Also Saturday, more than 100 East Germans protested in front of
the Soviet Embassy in East Berlin against the stationing of Soviet
helicopters in their country, ADN said.
   ADN said the demonstrators held signs saying ``Gorbi, what about
disarmament?'' and ``Tanks out, helicopters in?''
   The protesters, from the East German town of Prenzlau, claimed
the Soviets had backed out of disarmament plans by replacing a tank
unit that had been stationed at a military base there with
helicopters, ADN reported.
   According to ADN, the demonstrators, who came from church and
citizens' groups as well as from the town council, issued a
statement calling for civilian use of the base.
   Prenzlau, a town of 22,000, is located about 50 miles north of
Berlin.
