    Gorbachev Leaves Door Open to German Reunification.
   </title>
   <text>
    President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Tuesday with
East German Premier Hans Modrow and appeared to be more open toward
eventual German reunification.
   Modrow told reporters after the meeting that Gorbachev ``did not
rule out such a prospect in the future, and at the same time did
not venture to set some time limits for that.''
   Earlier, the Kremlin chief said any such decisions must include
the four Allied powers and take into account European opinions.
   ``The development of events in the world, in East Germany, in
the Soviet Union demand deep consideration and an analytical
approach to deciding this problem,'' he said in remarks reported by
the official news agency Tass.
   ``Time itself is acting on this process, giving it dynamism,''
Gorbachev said. ``We have to act responsibly and not decide this
important question on the streets.''
   Tass said Gorbachev emphasized that talks about restructuring
relations between the two Germanys must involve ``all directly
interested governments.''
   Asked by an East German correspondent about his attitude toward
reunification, Gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and
that ``no one can cast doubt'' on the reasonableness of asking it.
   However, the English-language Tass translation indicated
Gorbachev could have meant there were no doubts about reunification
itself.
   Gorbachev's position was similar to that adopted by Communists
in East Berlin on Tuesday. For the first time, the Communists
acknowledged German unity as a long-term goal but said it must be
imbedded in the process of overcoming Europe's overall divisions.
   The Soviet Union traditionally has strongly opposed any talk of
German reunification, but Gorbachev has softened that position in
adopting a policy that has allowed radical reform in Eastern Europe.
   Soviets say the question of German reunification is to be
decided in the future.
   Gorbachev, in comments to reporters after meeting French
President Francois Mitterrand in Kiev in December, reiterated his
view that the existence of two German states is a fact based on the
outcome of World War II.
   But he added, ``The present situation is the result of specific
historical events, a specific historical process on this continent.
So, history should decide the future of this continent.''
   ``I don't think it is a topical question today. A different
approach may create a situation that would complicate the entire
European process, including the relations between the two German
states,'' Gorbachev said.
   Modrow said the two Germanys could work toward confederation in
phases with no time limit.
   He said he agreed with Gorbachev that reunification must be
decided not only by East and West Germany, but all of Europe.
   According to Tass, the Soviet leader said any action on
reunification must not infringe on the interests of either East or
West Germany, the four Allied powers: France, Britain, the United
States or the Soviet Union, or anyone else in Europe.
   Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of West Germany's Free Democratic
Party, a partner in the governing coalition, said Tuesday in London
that Gorbachev has adopted ``a more positive attitude'' toward
German reunification.
   In a TV interview on Britain's Channel 4, he also urged
``economic union'' within 18 months as a prelude to full union of
West and East Germany.
   Lambsdorff said that because of East Germany's political
instability it had only two choices _ unification or chaos.
   Modrow invited Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to visit
East Germany and they accepted, Tass reported.
   Modrow arrived in Moscow late Monday. A Communist, he has moved
forward the country's first free elections from May to March 18 and
brought the opposition into a coalition that will govern until then.
