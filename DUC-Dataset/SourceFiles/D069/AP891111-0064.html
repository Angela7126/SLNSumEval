    East German Changes Spark Interest in Reunification.
   </title>
   <text>
    The concept of a reunified Germany enjoys
support from the United States and other countries but some
analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic
German superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout Europe.
   The lifting of travel restrictions by East Germany on Thursday
has breathed new life into the idea of a single German state,
drawing expressions of support from the Bush administration and
others.
   But Soviet affairs expert William Hyland says that despite these
assertions, a reunified Germany is ``really terrifying to most of
the countries involved, to the West Germans, to the United States,
Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   ``No one really wants German unity except the East German
people, and they turn out to be the decisive factor,'' says Hyland,
a one-time top aide to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
   It was just 2{ months ago when ceremonies were held
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II, a
time when a unified Germany initiated what was to become the
slaughter of more than 50 million people.
   While a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under
any scenario, an undivided Germany could become the unchallenged
economic and political force on the continent.
   The official U.S. policy on the reunification question was
outlined last Thursday by State Department deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher.
   ``Reunification has been supported by NATO and by the United
States for 40 years, and our strongly held view is that
reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of Germany must
take place in peace and freedom,'' he said.
   As former National Security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski sees it,
the reunification issue will become ``very, very active'' if a
freely elected government takes power in East Germany.
   That possibility has been mentioned by East German leaders as
part of the ongoing reform process.
   Brzezinski asks: ``How do we arrange for the unification of
Germany, so that it doesn't become destabilizing, so it isn't a
threat to Germany's neighbors _ France, Poland, Czechoslovakia?
   ``These are the issues we really have to very hard think about.
We have to think of a new structure between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact. That is our new agenda.''
   Theodore Sorenson, a top aide to President John F. Kennedy when
the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, says he hopes a reunited Germany
will be forged as part of a reunited Europe.
   Reunification, Sorenson says, ``will pose problems, because we
couldn't afford to have a reunited Germany outside the Western
Alliance. The Soviet Union couldn't afford to have a reunited
Germany as part of the Western Alliance.
   ``That's why I hope it will be a reunited Europe within which
the reunited Germany can take place,'' Sorenson says.
   Bernard Rogers, a former commander of allied forces in Europe,
does not think reunification is inevitable. Some form of
federation, he believes, is more likely.
   Rogers notes that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has said
the nations of eastern Europe can do what they want so long as they
stay in the Warsaw Pact.
   ``If East Germany stays in the Warsaw Pact, NATO, with the best
of its ability, would try to prevent full reunification; maybe a
confederation between the two Germanys, but not a full
reunification,'' Rogers says.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, points out that
German reunification is a sensitive question for the Soviets.
   ``Soviet policy is based upon preventing a reunified,
economically strong and certainly militarily strong Germany,''
Mitchell says. ``There must be some serious apprehension in the
Soviet Union today, because the events of the last couple of days
certainly has made reunification more likely.''
   The Bush administration says it does not foresee the dismantling
of NATO under any circumstances but, according to Hyland, the
reunification of Germany could mean the demise of the alliance.
   ``It may also mean the end of Western European unity, because
both have been based on a divided Germany and a divided Europe,''
Hyland says. ``If that comes to an end and 80 million Germans are
united in a confederation or a single state, it changes the entire
map of Europe.
   ``It changes all of the geopolitics and, in effect, ends the
period we've been in since ... the beginning of the war.''
