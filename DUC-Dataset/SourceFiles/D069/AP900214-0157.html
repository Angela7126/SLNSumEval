    Jewish Leader Seeks to Discuss Reunification with Germans.

   <text>
    The chairman of the Simon Wisenthal Center has
asked to meet with the leaders of West and East Germany to discuss
``the great fear that German reunification brings to the community
of victims of Nazism.''
   ``I must tell you I am not among those in the cheering section
applauding the rush towards German reunification,'' Rabbi Marvin
Hier wrote Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and Prime
Minister Hans Modrow of East Germany.
   ``However, if that is the inevitable course, let us at least
place on record our concerns,'' he said.
   Hier is the founder of the center, headquartered in Los Angeles,
which seeks to keep alive the memory of the Nazi persecution of
Jews in Germany and Nazi-conquered lands.
   In nearly identical letters, he asked to meet with Kohl during
his forthcoming trip to Washington and with Modrow in Germany next
month. The letters were made available Wednsday to The Associated
Press.
   ``You are undoubtedly aware,'' he wrote both leaders, ``of the
great fear that German reunification brings to the community of
victims of Nazism.''
   ``It is not an irrational fear of the kind that one explains
away as the nightmares of victims who remain locked into their past
and lose all perspective of present reality.
   ``The fears are real because those who bear the scars of the
last `unified Germany' do not see their concerns being addressed in
the current reunification discussions betwen world leaders.''
   Hier listed 10 points he wanted to raise. Among them were a
program to teach German schoolchildren about the annhilation of the
Jews; the creation of an agency to monitor and prosecute hate
groups; the continuation of the ``special relationship'' now
existing between West Germany and Israel; the convening of a 1992
conference of world leaders on the 50th anniversary of the
conference at which ``the final solution'' was developed; the
establisment of a German commission to protect Holocaust sites; the
banning of terrorist organizations that ``have enjoyed
respectablity in East Germany;'' a cultural exchange program
between German and Jewish organizations; German television and
radio programs on the reconciliation; restitution payments to the
families and victims of Nazism, and a German commitment to
revitalize former synagogues in East German territory.
