    What Makes Gilbert So Strong?
   </title>
   <text>
    Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low
pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of
Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that
baffles forecasters.
   ``It's a matter of getting everything together in the right
place in the right time,'' Gil Clark of the National Hurricane
Center said Thursday. ``It doesn't happen very often. How it
develops, we don't know.''
   Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a
dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.
   ``We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer. About one of
six develop,'' said Clark.
   By Sept. 8, the system became a depression. It reached tropical
storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.
   A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.
When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named
tropical storm. It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds
hit 74 mph.
   Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems
didn't ``is a mystery more or less,'' said University of Miami
meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.
   ``The first part of the summer we were biting our nails,
wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop,'' he said
Thursday. ``That's something meteorologists would like to know more
about.''
   But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once
development begins. And they know that development is sparked when
winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.
   ``If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in
the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this
convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,'' Bleck
said.
   ``If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the clouds
occasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergence
pattern. That strengthens it,'' he said, adding that storms can
begin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.
   Eventually, a vortex is created.
   ``Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning.
That's what makes the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, those
winter storms,'' Bleck said.
   Hurricanes ``are useful to the climate machine. Their primary
role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,''
he said. ``The sun puts energy into the water, the top of the
oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere. That has to be
distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere.''
   When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados,
warm Atlantic waters nurtured it.
   ``This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best for
development,'' Clark said. ``If you get a storm in this area in
September, when the water's warmest, it can just explode. This is
where Camille formed and exploded,'' referring to the 1969 storm
that slammed into the Gulf Coast.
   ``It is an exciting thing to watch. If you're on the beach
watching the storm surge, it's a different story,'' he said.
   The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on
record in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inches
Tuesday night. That broke the 26.35 inches of the 1935 hurricane
that devastated the Florida Keys.
