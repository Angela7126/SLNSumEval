    Group Claims Iran Underreporting Earthquake Casualties.

    Iran is deliberately underreporting the number
of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a
political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the
country's Islamic leadership say.
   ``The regime is very much fearful of public outrage,'' said
Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran.
``They're very much afraid of the political aftershocks.''
   As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced
Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street
from the White House.
   Northern Iran was stuck Thursday by an earthquake measuring
between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter Scale. Iran has told the United
Nations that the death toll is at least 36,000, but Gobadi said his
organization has received estimates closer to 100,000.
   Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake
victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with
neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.
   ``They have been very late in assisting the people,'' he said.
   Sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for
the chanting, flag-waving rally participants, who also carried
signs criticizing their native country.
   Planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake,
but part of the Friday's activities focused on Iran's stricken
residents.
   Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people
to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.
   ``This regime has brought them nothing but devastation and
misery. This regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless
war with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home,'' he said.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire was declared last year after eight
years of the Iran-Iraq war.
   Iran's Islamic republic was established in 1979 after Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66
Americans hostage.
   The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran in April
1980. The shah died in exile in July 1980, U.S. hostages were freed
six months later and Khomeini died last June.
   Gobadi said his 25-year-old group had helped depose the shah but
had no part in organizing the Islamic republic.
   ``Even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the
regime in Iran,'' Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., told an estimated
3,000 people attending the rally.
   ``There were many, many victims before this tragedy and there
are victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people of
the United States,'' he said.
   Dymally, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
praised President Bush's offer of humanitarian aid to Iran but said
Bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through
non-government groups.
   The State Department said Friday that Iran was willing to accept
earthquake relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S.
humanitarian organizations.
