   <text>
    Countries worldwide, both friendly and hostile to Tehran's
Islamic government, sent supplies, medical personnel and
condolences to Iran, where about 40,000 people have died in an
earthquake.
   Iran's deadliest earthquake since 1976 jolted the northern part
of the country Thursday, devastating towns and injuring at least
100,000 people.
   The United States sent a message of condolence and expressed its
willingness to provide humanitarian aid.
   Iran, which has had no diplomatic ties with the United States
since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran,
said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other
U.S. humanitarian groups.
   Moderate Arab countries with which Iran has had prickly
relations _ Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan _ also offered their
support.
   An official statement distributed late Friday by the Saudi Press
Agency said the kingdom followed with ``deep sorrow'' the news of
the tragedy.
   ``The kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... declares its readiness to help
in extending assistance to those harmed by the tragedy, wishing to
help ease the pain of the afflicted from among the sons of the
Iranian Moslem nation,'' it said.
   Jordan announced Saturday it was sending medical aid to Iran,
but details were not immediately clear.
   King Hussein sent condolences to Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani on Friday in what is believed to be the first direct
contact between Jordanian and Iranian heads of state in almost a
decade.
   Jordan backed Iraq in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which ended
with a cease-fire in August 1988, and at one point sent hundreds of
Jordanian volunteers to fight alongside Iraqi soldiers.
   Egypt was sending two military planes with supplies, the Middle
East News Agency reported. President Hosni Mubarak offered the aid
``in the framework of Egypt's concern to provide help for brothers
and friends, especially at times of natural disasters.''
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that a
professional lifesaving team from the Armenian capital of Yerevan
flew Saturday to Iran. The team gained experience in the
devastating 1988 earthquake in Armenia that killed 25,000 people.
   Thousands of residents in the predominantly Moslem Soviet
republic of Azerbaijan, which borders Iran, donated tons of flour,
rice and tea, and contributed more than $500,000 to a special
earthquake fund, Tass said.
   The Italian Red Cross sent a plane to Iran Saturday with relief
supplies, including tents, blankets and medicine.
   In Paris, the French government, which already has sent a
200-member civil defense team _ including rescuers, medical
personnel and search dogs _ said Saturday it would send an entire
mobile hospital unit if Iran wanted it.
   In West Germany, the Foreign Ministry said that it was sending
tents, blankets, hospital equipment and cooking equipment to Iran.
Eight tons was being shipped Saturday and the government has
chartered a jumbo jet to transport 100 tons of equipment Monday.
   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II sent aid to earthquake victims
and a message of condolence to Iranian leaders.
   The Vatican said in a statement that the donation of an
unspecified amount was to ``provide for the most immediate needs of
the population hurt by this huge earthquake.''
   John Paul also sent a telegram to the papal nuncio, or
diplomatic representative, in Tehran saying the pope ``is praying
fervently for the wounded and the families of the victims.''
   The Indian government said it would donate medicine, blankets
and other relief supplies worth more than $500,000.
   China's Red Cross said it was sending $106,000 worth of relief
supplies, state-run television said Saturday.
   The Polish government was sending 5 tons of powdered milk, a ton
of bed sheets, a ton of medicine and 3 tons of blankets and
clothing, according to Polish media reports.
   Malaysia was providing more than $90,000 in relief aid. Foreign
Ministry Secretary-General Ahmad Kamil Jaafar told reporters
Saturday the money would be used to buy medicine, food, powdered
milk, tents and other essential items.
