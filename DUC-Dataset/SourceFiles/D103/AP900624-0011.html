    Radical Paper Blames U.S., In Part, For Quake Damage.

    An anti-American newspaper in Iran said
Sunday the United States is partly to blame for the death of tens
of thousands of people in last week's earthquake.
   The ``criminal role of America in Iran's past became evident
once again in the recent earthquake,'' the Jomhuri Islami said in
an editorial reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   ``Our people, even under the rubble, chant `Death to America'
and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States ... even
those hands stretched out to help,'' it said.
   It argued that by ``plundering Iran's oil and other resources''
for 25 years, the United States had prevented the use of even a
small part of the national wealth for urban development projects
and ``advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems.''
   ``Even after its expulsion from Iran, the U.S. government by
imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots,
halted the renovation of the country,'' the editorial added.
   The newspaper was implying that with these actions the United
States had blocked the diversion of funds to earthquake safety
measures.
   ``If the United States has real humanitarian objectives and
intended to help the Iranian nation, it should do only one thing,
stop hatching plots,'' the newspaper said.
   It called on Iranians to reject relief offers by the United
States and ``other governments whose hands are stained with the
blood of the Iranian people.''
   Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of
hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has said it would welcome
relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian
groups. The two nations have no diplomatic ties.
