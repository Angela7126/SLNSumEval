    IRAN ACCEPTS U.S. HELP; EARTHQUAKE DEATH TOLL HITS 35,000.
   </title>
   <text>
    <p>
     Iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy, the 
United States, to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as 
35,000 people, the State Department said in Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
     The aid would be accepted through the American Red Cross and other U.S. 
humanitarian organizations, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We want to be helpful without regard for our political differences with Iran," 
he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     There have been only rare instances of U.S.-Iranian cooperation since the two 
countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago. The United States holds Iran 
partly responsible for the continued detention of American hostages by 
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Boucher said Iran told the U.S. government that private donor agencies should 
contact the Iranian Red Crescent, a humanitarian group that is the conduit for 
all outside assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
     The U.S. government routinely channels humanitarian assistance through the Red 
Cross and other donor groups.
    </p>
    <p>
     Boucher said the Iranian message to the United States presumably was delivered 
through a third party but added that he was uncertain. Messages between the two 
countries normally are handled by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran.
    </p>
    <p>
     Iranian authorities have told United Nations officials that about 35,000 people 
died in the earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
     Iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries -- including Iraq 
-- but excluded Israel and South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rescuers in Iran today freed thousands of people from buildings flattened by 
the earthquake in northern Iran, which struck early Thursday and had a 
magnitude between 7.3 and 7.7.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Islamic Republic News Agency said 6,000 people were pulled from rubble and 
airlifted from the stricken Gilan and Zanjan provinces to hospitals.
    </p>
    <p>
     Iranian television showed scenes of devastation, including the remains of an 
entire row of hillside village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rescuers scooped up rubble and used police dogs to find victims. They gently 
fed water to one man who was trapped in a mass of stones and earth, only his 
head protruding.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Iranian Red Crescent asked for help in providing shelter for 400,000 people 
left homeless by the earthquake. Offers of help came from across the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
     The death toll was higher than a quake that killed 25,000 people in nearby 
Soviet Armenia in December, 1988, and a quake in Iran in 1978 that also killed 
25,000.
    </p>
    <p>
     In scenes shown on television, masked rescuers in white aprons pulled 
dust-covered bodies from under concrete slabs. Corpses were laid on blocks of 
ice in open trucks.
    </p>
    <p>
     The state-run television interviewed one middle-aged man from Roodbar, a 
mountainside village in Gilan province, who said he was sleeping when the 
temblor struck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was so strong," he said. "I was thrown several meters, I ended up by the 
olive trees," outside his home. "Then a big boulder hit the house. The house 
collapsed. I lost all four of my children."
