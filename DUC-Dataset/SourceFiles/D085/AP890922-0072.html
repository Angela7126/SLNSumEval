    Hurricane Forecasters Carry On Amid Chaos.
   </title>

    Amid the uproar of live coverage by the
major networks and scores of other media organizations, National
Hurricane Center forecasters went about their business of monitoring
Hurricane Hugo.
   ``The whole system looks chaotic, but it works,'' said Bob
Sheets, the center's director.
   On one side of a large room dominated by a U-shaped bank of
monitoring equipment were the forecasters, making meticulous
calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and
getting emergency operations going in those areas.
   On the other side were the media _ a pack of reporters, camera
operators and technicians, jockeying for seconds of Sheets' time and
tidbits of his expertise.
   In the center was Sheets himself. Surrounded by cameras, wires
and two dozen journalists with pads and telephones, the ubiquitous
red-headed meteorologist has appeared on television all week next to
a large satellite monitor showing colorful images of Hurricane Hugo.
   During prime news time, competing technicians and cameramen shout
and make rude hand gestures for people to get out of their shots of
Sheets.
   At his back, casually dressed forecasters who have been working
12-hour days tracked the storm via computers and satellites.
   ``We obviously don't like this and could probably do a better
job, but everyone knows now because of the media,'' said hurricane
specialist Max Mayfield. ``In the Caribbean, we were not so certain
the word got out. But we know the Carolinas have been evacuated.''
   When a hurricane warning goes into effect, ``It's a $50 million
statement,'' said meteorologist Joel Cline, referring to the cost of
emergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implemented
when the warning is posted.
   ``If we weren't here, then you wouldn't know that a storm was out
there,'' he said. Before the hurricane warning system was
established, a storm of Hugo's power would have cost thousands of
lives. But early today, after days of warnings and proper evacuation
procedures, there were no immediate reports of deaths despite
widespread damage in Charleston and other coastal areas of South
Carolina.
   ``I like to think that we make a difference a far as human lives
are concerned,'' Cline said.
   After Hugo's landfall, Sheets and the other forecasters began to
wind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the last
several days. But, he warned, the hurricane center still is
following three other weather systems that have moved into the
Atlantic between the United States and Africa, and another storm in
the Pacific.
   ``I hate to say we're breathing a sigh of relief because people
are getting clobbered to death,'' meteorologist Mark Zimmer said as
the storm pounded Charleston, S.C. ``But we've done all we can.''
