    State-By-State Survey of Drought Developments.
   </title>
   <text>
    Here is a state-by-state summary of the latest drought
developments:
   </text>
   <text>
    Recent rain in central and south Alabama haven't helped cities'
water supplies enough to lift surcharges and limits on outdoor
watering.
   Northern Alabama has missed most of the rain and the region's
top crop, cotton, is in a critical situation, said John Trotman,
state director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service.

    Georgia's carpet industry may be forced to reduce production and
lay off workers if the drought continues for an extended period,
industry officials said.
   ``It is something you don't like to think about, but if you
don't have water, you can't run your mills,'' said John A. Shaheen,
vice chairman of World Carpets Inc. in Dalton.

    The drought has inflicted serious damage to wildlife along the
Illinois River, even though the water level has remained near
normal.
   Wayne Herndon, a biologist with the state Department of
Conservation, said the drought, now nearly midway through its
second summer, has damaged the river's backwater lakes, virtually
eliminating a year's supply of the river's gamefish.
   The mercury hit 100 degrees Friday at O'Hare International
Airport, bettering the previous high for the day of 99 and
establishing a second record by giving the city its fifth
100-degree or better temperature of the summer. Chicago sweltered
through four 100-degree days in 1934, 1947 and 1953.

    Thunderstorms brought rain, lightning and 70 mph winds to
northern Indiana Friday night, causing widespread power outages in
the city of Fort Wayne and apparently causing a toy factory to
collapse. No injuries were reported.
   The Indiana Board of Health issued a heat warning as
temperatures soared above 100 and humidity levels boosted the heat
index to more than 110 degrees. The National Weather Service said
the conditions likely would continue through the weekend.

    National Guardsmen stood by with 400 gallons of drinking water
for about 50 homes in Elk Horn while officials tried to find more
water to get the town through the drought.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department announced Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng would visit Iowa as part of a 10-state tour of drought
areas.

    Severe thunderstorms spawning tornadoes and strong winds rolled
across central Kansas Friday night. A tornado touched down near
Clay Center, destroying an unoccupied mobile home and damaging
barns and hog sheds. High winds also damaged trees and power lines.

    Agriculture Commissioner Ward ``Butch'' Burnette returned from
Oregon, saying he had prospects for perhaps 10,000 tons of hay,
badly needed by cattle producers. One railroad, CSX Transportation
Corp., offered to bring the hay free of charge from Chicago if the
Union Pacific or Burlington Northern lines could get it to Chicago.
   Thirty tons of Oregon hay arrived by jet in Louisville, courtesy
of United Parcel Service. That shipment, like several others, was
earmarked for distribution Monday.

    Severe thunderstorms accompanied by high winds and hail moved
over much of Michigan on Friday, downing trees and causing power
outages. Concern over the effects of the drought on the timber
industry outweighed relief brought by the showers.
   ``You have to take more precautions, and you can't use certain
machinery with exhaust systems that send sparks that might set a
fire,'' said Matt Repar, who has been logging for 28 years.
   The U.S. Forest Service has banned all machinery with internal
combustion engines from the Upper Peninsula's Hiawatha National
Forest after noon. John McGregor of the state Department of Natural
Resources has said that if the drought keeps up, the state may ban
commercial logging.

    A brief thunderstorm brought little relief following record heat
that helped kill 3,000 young turkeys near Princeton and prompted
health warnings.
   Friday's high of 102 degrees in the Twin Cities topped the
previous record for the date, 101 degrees i 1931. With the ``heat
index'' _ the summertime equivalent of the wind-chill factor _
forecasters said 102 degrees felt like 114.
   ``This is the kind of situation that is really bad for the sick
and elderly, and especially the elderly,'' said Greg Spoden,
assistant state climatologist.

    Gov. John Ashcroft issued his second statewide heat alert of the
summer, urging private and public organizations to aid those
suffering from the sizzling temperatures. ``Unless we act now to
gear up public and private efforts to care for those without
shelter from the stifling heat, the potential for human loss over
the weekend is staggering,'' Ashcroft said.

    More than 700 firefighters battled a lightning-caused blaze that
combined with other fires and spread to 14,800 acres in the Custer
National Forest of southeast Montana. Bulldozers, helicopters and
bombers dropping fire retardant fought the blaze in the tinder-dry
forest on the South Dakota border

    The Army Corps of Engineers has further reduced the flow of
water through Orwell Dam on the Otter Tail River near Fergus Falls,
Minn., a main feeder of the Red River, which runs along the
Minnesota-North Dakota border.
   The reduction could affect Fargo's supply of water, according to
Ron Hendrickson, city water plant superintendent.

    Gov. Richard Celeste signed an executive order banning open
burning because of extraordinary dry conditions.
   In Columbus, farmers began loading up their shares of more than
40,000 bales of hay delivered this week from three Southern states.
Farmers in the southwestern corner of the state postponed
cloud-seeding because there were no clouds.

    Representatives from Japanese flour mills visited with wheat
producers. Ben Handcock, executive director of the South Dakota
Wheat Commission, said the Japanese would buy wheat, but probably
not from this year's crop because of the drought.
   ``They heard about the drought the same as everybody else did
and they think we're out of wheat. The fact of the matter is that
we have a lot of good quality wheat left from last year and
previous years,'' Handcock said.

    Farmers say the drought is causing a shortage of feed, grass and
water, leading them to sell more livestock. At the
Tennessee-Kentucky Livestock Inc. auction barn in Guthrie, Ky.,
livestock sales have doubled, said an owner of the barn, Dorris
Bryant.

    Gov. Tommy G. Thompson signed a drought relief bill Friday
making $35 million in emergency loans available to Wisconsin
farmers. Legislators said it could help up to 5,000 farmers avoid
losing their farms.
