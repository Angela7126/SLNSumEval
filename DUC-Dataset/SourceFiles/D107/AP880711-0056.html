    U.N. Agency Projects Food Shortages Due To U.S. Drought.

    The crippling drought hitting North America is
expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food
shortages in many poor countries, the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization reported today.
   The agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total
1.785 billion tons, only two million tons more than last year's
level, which was already below the expected production.
   If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production
would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and
farmers' participation in a government crop reduction program
decreased output, the agency reported.
   As a result, world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310
million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers
necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said. If
crop conditions in the United States and Canada continue to
deteriorate, the ratio could drop even further.
   ``Such a development would have serious implications for the
food security, particularly of many low-income, food-deficit
countries,'' the report said.
   The high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit
poor, food-importing countries the hardest, the U.N. agency warned.
It said the rising prices could also reduce food aid from developed
countries.
   The most severely hit crops are coarse grains _ mostly maize,
barley and oats, the report said.
   The agency projected good harvests in other parts of the world.
In Asia the yearly monsoon rains started on time, and production in
Europe and the Soviet is expected to be larger than last year.
Grain production in South America should be slightly lower this
year than last.
   In the Sahel region of sub-Saharan Africa, however, locusts
flourishing in unexpectedly heavy rains have damaged this year's
harvest. Potential crop losses from the pests could hit 1 million
tons, FAO said.
