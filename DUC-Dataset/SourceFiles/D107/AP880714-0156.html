    Expert Suggests Planets Affect Drought.

    Weather experts discussed the drought
Thursday and its possible causes and effects, and said they hoped
to produce a consensus on how much longer it will last.
   All of the speakers at the 1988 Drought Symposium called for
more research and study.
   ``There's an enormous number of possibilities that one could
chase. The next business of the scientist is to eliminate the
possibilities of ... and extend the range of analysis and look for
cause and effect,'' said David Rodenhuis, director of the federal
Climate Analysis Center in Washington.
   The symposium attended by 13 state and national experts was
sponsored by The Weather Channel, an Atlanta-based cable network,
which broadcast the meeting live.
   John Hope, the network's hurricane specialist and a former
forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Fla., said
the drought in the Southeast might be lessened or ended in the next
few months by a heavier than normal hurricane season.
   Hope said current weather conditions point to more tropical
storms, more of which should become hurricanes, in this hurricane
season.
   He stressed that a hurricane's effect on drought is variable,
depending on the intensity and speed of the storm. Nevertheless, he
said, some Southeastern states get as much as 25 pecent of their
rainfall in some months from hurricanes.
   Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer told the symposium
he thought the position of the planet Jupiter had something to do
with drought in the Southeast.
   However, Rodenhuis said he was skeptical about Plummer's thesis.
``It's very necessary to be cautious and analytical about the
issue,'' he said.
