    Most of U.S. To Be Hot, Dry Until Mid-August, Weather Service Says.

    Weather forecasters today were offering
drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate
outlooks for the next 30 days and three months.
   A new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said ``many
areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent
chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.''
   The disappointing forecast came as President Reagan headed to
the Midwest to inspect drought-plagued farms.
   On Tuesday the Agriculture Department reported sharp declines in
the outlook for several crops.
   That was followed Wednesday by a 30-day forecast from the
National Weather Service saying that drought-stricken areas from
the Dakotas east to New York and from the Canadian border to
Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee are likely to continue to be short
of rain.
   That area, which includes the major grain-growing states where
crops already are suffering, is given a 55 percent chance of less
than normal rainfall.
   And some states in the center of the area, stretching from West
Virginia to Nebraska and from Wisconsin to Missouri, may be even
drier. They are given a 60 percent chance of being short of
precipitation.
   A slice of southern California, including Los Angeles, is the
driest area in the forecast, with a 70 percent chance of having
below normal rainfall. The rest of coastal California also will be
dry, the forecast said.
   The outlook also says there's a 55 percent chance of hotter than
normal temperatures through the U.S. heartland from New England to
Idaho and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma. Within that area,
the chances of high temperatures are above 65 percent in Wyoming,
while central Midwestern states have a 60 percent chance of above
average temperatures.
   Wetter than normal weather is predicted for west and south
Texas, and parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Normal
precipitation is forecast for the Atlantic and Gulf coast states,
along with the Northwest and northern Mountain States.
   The Weather Service said normal temperatures are expected for
the Atlantic states from Virginia south, and for the Gulf Coast
states. West Texas and New Mexico may be cooler than normal, but
the far West is expected to see its normal quota of summer heat.
   The separate drought impact assessment, issued by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Office, points out
that predicting an end to the drought is a complex thing, since dry
spells have no normal lifetime. The low 4 percent probability of an
end within 3 months is based simply on a statistical analysis of
past droughts, the agency said.
   The report noted that as of the end of June, 29 percent of the
continental United States was experiencing severe or extreme
drought, with parts of 35 states affected. That puts the current
drought on the same level as the one in 1911, but still less severe
than the droughts of 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934.
