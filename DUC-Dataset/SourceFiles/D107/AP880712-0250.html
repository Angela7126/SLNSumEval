    Several states in the Mideast are facing the drought.

    Kentucky's governor has criticized the federal government for
being too slow in dealing with the drought, and Iowa's governor
warns that farmers in his state still face potential disaster
despite up to five inches of rain over the weekend.
   Crews began installing pumps on barges Monday to haul fresh
water to southern Louisiana towns plagued by rising salt levels in
the lower Mississippi River.
   Meanwhile, House Speaker Jim Wright said in Washington he hopes
that a relief package with disaster payments of up to $100,000 for
drought-stricken farmers will win committee approval and be ready
for floor action in Congress this week.

    The drought may force the government to ease
crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild
its grain inventories, says Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
   But the United States will continue to be a major player in
world agriculture and in 1989 should be able to bounce back from
this year's drought losses, he said Monday.
   A larger portion of the United States suffered from some degree
of drought stress in May and June than at any point since records
began in 1895, Lyng said.

    Grain and soybean futures have dropped to their
lowest levels in more than five weeks as weekend rains in the
Midwest prompted a third straight day of plummeting prices on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   July soybeans fell 66 cents a bushel Monday to $8.58, the lowest
price for that contract since June 3. Corn for July delivery
dropped 20{ cents to $2.89 a bushel, the lowest level since June 15.
   Wheat and oat futures also closed lower.

    Crude oil futures prices have hit their lowest
closing level since late 1986, hurt by a selloff that traders blame
on too much supply and renewed skepticism about OPEC's ability to
restrain production.
   Monday's decline erased gains made last week that had been based
on fears of supply disruptions caused by the oil platform explosion
in the North Sea.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, an important barometer of
price trends, the August-delivery price for West Texas Intermediate
crude settled at $14.78 per barrel, down from $15.46 late Friday.
It was the lowest closing price for the near-month crude contract
since a $14.71 close on Nov. 3, 1986.

    Savings institution depositors withdrew more
money from their accounts than they deposited in May for the first
time in seven months, while losses continued to erode the ailing
industry's capital, the government reports.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Monday net withdrawals at
the nation's 3,102 federally insured S&amp;Ls totaled $941 million in
May. But the decline came after seven consecutive months of net
deposit gains totaling $28 billion.

    Stock prices crept higher Monday in quiet trading. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials rose 5.16 points to 2,111.31.
   The dollar limbed to recent highs against several major
currencies. Gold prices fell sharply.
   Bond prices rose modestly in quiet trading following a week of
steady decline.
   Grain and soybean futures plunged, while wheat and oat futures
also declined.
