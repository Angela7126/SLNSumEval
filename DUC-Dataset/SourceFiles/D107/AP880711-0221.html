    Lyng Says Drought Could Prompt Relaxed Crop Acreage Controls Next
Year.

    The drought may force the government to ease
crop acreage controls next year to help the United States rebuild
its grain inventories, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said
Monday.
   But the United States ``will continue to be a major player'' in
world agriculture and in 1989 ``should be able to bounce back''
from this year's drought losses, he said.
   Lyng's remarks were prepared for delivery at a meeting of farm
magazine, extension, advertising, co-op and broadcast editors.
   A larger portion of the United States suffered from some degree
of drought stress in May and June than at any point since records
began in 1895, he said.
   Moreover, on July 2, about 35 percent of the contiguous United
States was in the ``severe to extreme'' drought category, he said.
In 1934, more than 60 percent was so rated, and in August 1954 more
than 50 percent was in that category.
   ``Because of the large early season area now experiencing
drought in the U.S., 1988 appears to have the potential to approach
or exceed the drought-affected areas of the 1930s and 1950s,'' Lyng
said.
   Even with the severe drought, there will be an adequate supply
of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the United States
``will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export
demand,'' he said.
   Lyng said total consumption of 1988 crops will probably be
somewhat less than previously estimated because prices are much
higher.
   ``But it is important to note that we will have no shortages,
that we will still be able to accommodate the needs of our overseas
buyers,'' he said.
