    Imprisoned Colleagues Visited Mandela Before Christmas.

    Four imprisoned African
National Congress leaders, convicted in 1964 with Nelson Mandela,
were allowed to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison
house, an activist said today.
   The four men, all held at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, were
taken to nearby Victor Verster Prison on Dec. 23 and spent about six
hours with Mandela, said Dullah Omar, an activist and family friend
of the Mandelas.
   Mandela was moved to the suburban-style home on the prison
grounds Dec. 7 after recovering from tuberculosis at a private
clinic in Cape Town.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, said after visiting her husband last
month that he is being held ``practically in solitary confinement''
at the house.
   The four men who visited Mandela are Walter Sisulu, Andrew
Mhlangeni, Raymond Mhlaba and Ahmed Kathrada.
   The men were convicted along with Mandela and three others at the
same trial in 1964. All were given life sentences for their
activities with the ANC, the main guerrilla group attempting to
overthrow the white-led government.
   ``All of them _ except Sisulu _ had not seen Nelson since 1986,
and they were very excited at being able to spend time with him,''
Omar said.
   Of the three co-defendants not at the Dec. 23 gathering, two have
been released and one remains at the Robben Island Prison near Cape
Town.
   The Prisons Service declined to confirm or deny the visit.
