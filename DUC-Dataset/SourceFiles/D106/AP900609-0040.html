    NYC Mayor Warns Jewish Groups Not To Protest Visit.

    Mayor David Dinkins warned Jewish groups against
protesting the visit of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to New
York City, saying the protests might insult the black community, a
newspaper said today.
   The mayor also asked members of the ``organized Jewish
community'' to dissuade more radical groups from disrupting the
visit, the Daily News said.
   Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, will visit
eight cities from June 20 to July 1.
   ``There is a danger of many people who hold Nelson Mandela in
very, very high esteem taking great umbrage'' at any public protest,
Dinkins said.
   ``I think it's sad and unfortunate and tactically very, very
unwise, because this man is an international symbol of freedom and
especially so seen by persons of color,'' Dinkins told the newspaper
in an interview.
   Leaders of several Jewish-American organizations plan to meet
Mandela on Sunday in Geneva. The organizations want the South
African leader to clarify his position on Israel.
   Mandela has embraced Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, in public and has compared the struggle of
Palestinians to that of black South Africans.
   Rabbi Abraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute announced his
Coalition of Concern will hold a protest at Mandela's public welcome
in New York because of the anti-apartheid leader's ``unbending
anti-Israel stance.''
   City councilman Noach Dear and state assemblyman Dov Hikind said
if Mandela does not make a strong statement in support of Israel,
they would take out ads in newspapers and hold demonstrations.
