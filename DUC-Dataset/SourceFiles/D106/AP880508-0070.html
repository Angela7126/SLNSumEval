    Wrangle Over Honorary Degree For Nelson Mandela.
   </title>
   <text>
    A 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting
Northeastern University to award an honorary degree to jailed South
African nationalist leader Nelson Mandela has raised objections
from some faculty and students.
   Northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring
Mandela on May 13, ending a long effort by students seeking to
change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who
could not be present at the ceremony.
   The degree is to be accepted by South African Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, who is scheduled to be in Boston for a benefit dinner.
   Law students last September began a campaign of demonstrations
and vigils on the campus. They hung a banner from the second floor
of the law library that said: ``Honor Nelson Mandela.''
   Before he was imprisoned, said third-year law student Sarah
Ottinger, ``Nelson Mandela was an ... attorney and an activist who
worked against apartheid. That's the message we wanted conveyed to
students.''
   South Africa's white-minority government says it will free
Mandela only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking
political power for blacks in the country.
   Some faculty members and students, including many blacks, have
criticized the administration's plan for the event, saying no
effort was made to include them.
   ``I don't even know what office is sponsoring it,'' said Keith
Motley, dean and director of the African-American Institute, a
student group. ``We got a memo from the administration saying they
need six ushers, but that's it.
   ``You'd think at least we'd be clued in to what's going on.''
   ``This started out as something noble, something we've tried to
have done for three years,'' said Ottinger. ``We are very, very
sorry it happened this way. It wasn't meant to turn out like this.''
   The trustees decided in January that Mandela should get the
honorary degree. Students set up a committee to contact Mandela's
family to get their approval.
   University spokesman Paul Jones said letters were sent to
Mandela's wife, Winnie, and his two daughters: Zenani, a student at
Boston University, and Makaziwe, a student at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston.
   However, Northeastern still has not received approval from the
Mandela family, The Boston Globe reported.
