    Young Survivor: `Everybody Wanted Their Mom'.
   </title>
   <text>
    Employees at a jewelry store huddled in
the vault while the shop came down around them. A man in an
apartment building stayed in his bathtub while the bathroom walls
crumbled and fell.
   Those were among the stories people in this northern Alabama
city swapped on Thursday as they assessed the damage from a tornado
that whipped through the heart of the city in a flash, leaving at
least 17 people dead and hundreds homeless.
   ``Everybody was screaming and windows started breaking and the
roof started to fall,'' recalled Vincent Davis, a fourth-grader at
Jones Valley Elementary School. ``The whole top story flew off.
Everybody wanted their mom.''
   Vincent was staying late at school Wednesday when the twister
hit shortly after 4:30 p.m. He was taken to a hospital with minor
injuries; five of about 30 children in a kindergarten class also
were reported hurt.
   Lynn Culpepper was in his bathtub at the Waterford Square
apartments, where at least a dozen buildings were destroyed. ``The
next thing I knew, glass was breaking and I was rolling on the
ground,'' he recalled.
   ``It was just black, and then there was this tumbling feeling
with debris flying around everywhere. When I opened my eyes and
looked around, there was just a pile of rubble where the apartments
used to be.''
   Culpepper's head and arms were cut in the collapse.
   Manager Bob Husman of a Golbro jewelry store ordered employees
into the vault shortly before the roof and walls crashed down on
him, 20 feet from the vault.
   ``In the jewelry business, the vault is the safest place,'' he
said. ``I had structural steel on me but managed to crawl out. It
was the worst kind of nightmare.''
   The employees in the vault were dug out an hour after the
collapse, shaken but not hurt.
   Rick Snider was in the bakery aisle of a supermarket.
   ``Part of the roof was coming off,'' he said. ``Some ladies were
crying, but it was quite calm. A checkout lady was hit with a cash
register. People were shouting, `Can I help?' and they were leading
people to the light. There was no screaming or hysterical stuff. I
came out and I couldn't believe the damage.''
   For Ed Rolan, a medic, the devastation brought back memories of
Vietnam. Rolan, who was driving home when the tornado hit, went
right to work helping the stricken motorists around him.
   ``One lady was thrown from her car and I thought she was dead,''
he said. ``I came back by her later and saw she had changed
positions. It took 30 minutes to get a stretcher to her.''
   The enormity of the death and destruction ``sank in very
quickly,'' Rolan said. ``This is the closest to death I have been
since Vietnam.''
