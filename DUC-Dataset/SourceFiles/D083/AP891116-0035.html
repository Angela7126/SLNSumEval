    Deadly Twister Smashes Huntsville, Ala.
   </title>
   <text>
    A tornado slammed into a shopping
district, a residential area and a school Wednesday, killing at
least 15 people, injuring more than 300 and trapping people in cars
and homes, authorities said.
   ``It's total destruction where the tornado hit. Cars are piled
on top of each other under piles of rubble where buildings used to
be,'' said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in
Montgomery.
   Emergency officials in Huntsville reported 15 confirmed deaths,
said Henry Jurnigan, a duty officer with the state Emergency
Management Agency in Montgomery. Mayor Steve Hettinger said 305
people were injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that
struck while streets of this northeastern Alabama city filled with
rush-hour traffic.
   Rescue teams with cranes and floodlights searched the rubble
through the night for injured or dead.
   ``Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment
complexes and shopping areas,'' said police spokesman Ben Jennings
after the twister touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in the
city's south section.
   ``It may be tomorrow before we have a final count,'' Gov. Guy
Hunt said at the state's disaster center in Montgomery.
   The governor dispatched 50 National Guardsmen, along with search
and rescue equipment.
   Rescuers picked through piles of rubble 10 to 14 feet deep, and
Cooper said police were unable to determine the extent of the
damaged area. Rescuers also were hampered by darkness and plunging
temperatures.
   ``We're even having a few snowflakes,'' said Cooper. High
temperatures in Huntsville were expected to be in the 30s Thursday,
he said.
   Witnesses said the downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the
Waterford Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were
reduced to rubble by the tornado.
   ``The only thing left standing was a door frame,'' news
photographer Mike Mercier said of the school, which was empty of
staff and pupils when the tornado hit. Police reported one person
killed in a car outside the school.
   Authorities said at least five were killed at Waterford Square
apartments, three at a business school, Southern Junior College,
which is located in a converted movie theater, and others in
scattered areas.
   ``Rescuers are digging in the rubble,'' state trooper W.L. Kelly
said. He said two people were killed when the twister hit house
trailers in rural areas east of Huntsville. The fifth death was
reported near the shopping district.
   The city is home to Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's
Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from the space
agency or weapons testing center.
   ``We've called in troopers from around the state to help,''
Kelly said.
   Telephone communication and electricity were disrupted by the
tornadoes and WAAY-TV, the only station still broadcasting,
reported widespread damage.
   ``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and
it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold
of,'' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when
the twister struck.
   ``It started picking cars up and pushing them around, ... some
of them upside down, some of them just strewn around,'' he said.
   Heavy overhead power lines ``started snapping just like a circus
performer would snap his whip,'' Carroll said.
   ``All of these heavy arcing, flashing lines that were just
popping and snapping over the top of us ... it was as if you were
looking into an arc-welder, they were so bright,'' he said.
   WAAY reported at least one person died when the roof of a
business collapsed from winds that overturned cars in the area. A
nearby shopping center also was damaged.
   Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors were
having difficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.
   The National Weather Service earlier said a tornado hit the east
Alabama hamlet of Mellow Valley, severely damaging at least one
home and causing some injuries. Weather officials said people were
trapped inside a collapsed house.
   A spokeswoman for the Clay County Sheriff's Department said
people were injured at one house in a rural area 30 miles east of
Sylacauga.
   Another tornado touched down about 1:30 p.m. as severe weather
swept across much of Alabama and the National Weather Service
placed most of the state under a tornado watch.
   A third tornado was reported shortly before 3:30 p.m. crossing
the Coosa River near Titus in east Alabama, the Weather Service
said.
   In Georgia, five people were injured, four critically, and at
least 200 people evacuated after a tornado struck two mobile home
parks and an interstate highway near Palmetto, about 25 miles
southeast of Atlanta, authorities said.
   Authorities in southwestern North Carolina said a pair of
storm-spawned tornadoes struck around 10:45 p.m., destroying a
vacant house in Henderson County.
   The National Weather Service also reported tornadoes inflicting
minor property damage in Kentucky and Mississippi.
