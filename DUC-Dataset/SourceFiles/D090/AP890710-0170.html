    Aquino Asks for Economic Aid for the Philippines.

    President Corazon Aquino of the
Philippines on Monday asked government and industrial leaders to
expand economic ties with her nation.
   Mrs. Aquino, on the first stop of her weeklong three-nation
European tour, met with West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and other
officials.
   Mrs. Aquino, comparing the task of strengthening the heavily
indebted Philippine economy to the recovery of West Germany after
World War II, asked that Germany share its experience with her
homeland.
   ``We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at
the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national
honor,'' she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industry
and Trade.
   ``We have paid as careful attention to the consequences of
runaway inflation and devaluation as Germany in the light of her own
experiences between the wars,'' she said.
   Mrs. Aquino said the Philippines' debt was projected to increase
to $29 billion by year's end but that much was money that ``was in
fact stolen by the previous government'' of ousted dictator
Ferdinand Marcos.
   She said that since her government took over in 1986, the
country's growth rate of minus 10 percent under Marcos in 1985 had
improved to a rate of plus 6.7 percent by 1988.
   ``What we need to complete the equation are two elements
essential to the German recovery _ debt relief and investments,''
Mrs. Aquino said.
   During a state banquet in the evening, Weizsaecker told Mrs.
Aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between West
Germany and the Philippines.
   Weizsaecker said the Philippines have had good results in trade
with West Germany, and assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-free
market the European Economic Community plans for 1992 will not lock
out trade with other countries.
   Mrs. Aquino, who arrived in West Germany on Sunday, will meet
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday before departing for Paris.
She also is to visit Belgium.
