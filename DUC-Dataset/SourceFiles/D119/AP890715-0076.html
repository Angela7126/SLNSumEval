    Senate Democrats Question ``Unqualified'' Bush Appointees.
   </title>
   <text>
    Joseph B. Gildenhorn, the lawyer and real
estate developer named by President Bush as U.S. ambassador to
Switzerland, and his immediate family gave nearly $230,000 to
Republican campaigns since 1984, disclosure statements show.
   Gildenhorn, according to Senate sources, is one of several Bush
ambassadorial nominees who have been rated ``unqualified'' by the
American Academy of Diplomacy, an organization composed of former
high ranking diplomats, including all living former secretaries of
state.
   One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and
contributors named to diplomatic posts, Gildenhorn gave $100,000
during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National
State Elections Committee. The gift was not subject to the
disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act.
   The 84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by
Gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by
Senate Democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many GOP
contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved
for Foreign Service professionals.
   Gildenhorn said Friday he could not comment because he is ``in a
confirmation process.''
   A report prepared by the State Department for the Foreign
Relations Committee said Gildenhorn would make an ``excellent''
candidate for an ambassadorship because of his ``solid background in
law and management.''
   It also cited another qualification.
   ``Mr. Gildenhorn has been a strong Republican supporter being a
member of the Eagles and Team 100,'' the State Department said.
   The Republican Eagles are contributors of $10,000 or more in a
single year to the Republican National Committee, while Team 100
designates people who have donated $100,000 or more.
   Gildenhorn's political contributions are listed on a disclosure
form submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has
set a hearing on the nomination for this week.
   They totaled $14,675 in 1984, $17,000 in 1985; $25,469.97 in
1986; $25,250 in 1987; $104,350 in 1988; and $11,000 this year. The
total: $197,744.97.
   Additionally, his wife, Alma Lee, gave $20,125 over the six
years, including $13,000 in 1988; his daughter, Carolyn, gave
$2,000; his son, Michael, gave $4,050 and his father, Oscar
Gildenhorn, gave $5,750.
   That brings the total contributions made by Gildenhorn and his
family to the GOP to $229,669.97 since 1984.
   Gildenhorn gave $50,000 during the period to the Republican
National Committee or to the Republican Eagles.
   He gave $2,500 in 1985 and $5,000 in 1986 to the Fund for the
American Future, a Bush political action committee and contributed
the legal limit of $1,000 to the Bush campaign in 1987.
   Gildenhorn also gave thousands of dollars to Republican
congressional candidates. Included were gifts to the campaigns of
Sens. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Bill Cohen, R-Maine; Pete Domenici,
R-N.M.; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; John Warner, R-Va.; Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; and former Sen. Paula Hawkins, R-Fla.
   Gildenhorn, 59, is a senior partner in Brown, Gildenhorn and
Jacobs, a law firm specializing in real estate. He is also president
of the JBG Real Estate Associates and JBG Properties Inc.
   Gildenhorn is also vice chairman of the board of directors of the
Sovran Bank here. He is a graduate of the University of Maryland and
Yale University Law School.
   Other ambassadorial nominees rated as unqualified by the American
Academy of Diplomacy include Florida real estate developer Joseph
Zappala, nominated as ambassador to Spain; Melvin L. Sembler, a real
estate executive in Florida named to be ambassador to Australia; and
Della M. Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker named to be
ambassador to New Zealand.
   No action has been taken by the Senate on any of those
nominations.
   According to Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who first raised the
issue of political contributions, Zappala and Sembler each
contributed more than $100,000 to Republican candidates and causes.
   Mrs. Newman served as chairman of the Washington state Bush for
President committee.
   Ambassador David Popper, president of the Academy of Diplomacy,
declined to confirm that Gildenhorn and the other three nominees had
been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors.
   But he said the academy does offer such ratings, making its
judgments based on a comparison of the nominee's biography and the
requirements of the job.
   He said the nonpartisan academy has no objections to political
appointees as such but does believe political nominees should be
qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the United States
abroad with ``dignity, respect and ability.''
   Twenty of 29 ambassadorial nomination made by Bush in the first
six months of his administration have gone to non-professionals,
many of them large contributors to Republican causes, committee
sources said.
   Sarbanes says the appointments are larding the diplomatic corps
with amateurs rewarded for purely political services.
   ``Political throwaways,'' Sarbanes calls them.
   ``I think the time has come, very frankly, to get off the money
merry-go-round and ask some very difficult questions, essentially
about when extensive political contributions are going to be a
sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination,'' Sarbanes
told the committee last month.
   ``It's not true in every instance, but in most of these cases you
seem to have to be over the $100,000 mark in order to make the
consideration list,'' Sarbanes said.
   Sarbanes says he is not against political ambassadors as such,
noting that many of them compiled distinguished records.
   ``It is not the political ambassadors that are the problem,''
Sarbanes said. ``It is ambassadors without qualifications.''
