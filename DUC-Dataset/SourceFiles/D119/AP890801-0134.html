    Ronald Spiers Replaces Joseph Reed As Top U.S. Official at U.N.
   </title>

    Ronald I. Spiers, a veteran U.S. diplomat,
will be the new undersecretary-general for General Assembly
affairs, the top-ranking American post at the world body, U.N.
officials said Tuesday.
   Spiers was ambassador to Pakistan from 1981-83 and has served as
ambassador to the Bahamas and Turkey.
   He replaces Joseph Verner Reed, a banker who served in the post
from 1987 until leaving last winter to become chief of protocol for
the United States.
   Although Spiers' nomination as undersecretary-general for
Political and General Assembly Affairs and Secretariat Services had
been an open secret for months, Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar announced it was effective as of Tuesday.
   Spiers, 64, is a career foreign service officer, most recently
serving as undersecretary of state for management since 1983.
   Spiers has been a member of the U.S. delegation to the United
Nations; was director of political affairs for the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency; and was director of NATO Affairs
for the State Department.
   From 1966-69, Spiers was counselor for political affairs in the
U.S. Embassy in London.
   In 1969, he became assistant secretary of State in charge of the
department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.
   When the Bahamas became independent from Britain in 1973, Spiers
became the first U.S. ambassador to that nation.
   He became charge d'affaires in London in 1974, and was minister
of the U.S. Embassy there until 1977, when he was appointed
ambassador to Turkey.
   In 1980 he returned to the State Department as director of
Intelligence and Research, and was appointed ambassador to Pakistan
in 1981.
