    WASHINGTON -- President Bush plans to name United Nations
Ambassador Thomas Pickering as U.S. envoy to India, and
appoint the current head of the foreign service to succeed
him.
   The White House, according to a U.S. official, hasn't yet
informed the Senate, which must confirm the nominations of
Mr. Pickering and Foreign Service Director General Edward
Perkins, a former U.S. envoy to South Africa.

    With the end of the Cold War, the U.N. is playing an
increasingly important role in working to resolve regional
disputes. It has led efforts to end civil wars in El Salvador
and Cambodia, and it also helped monitor elections in
Namibia. Last Friday, during an unprecedented U.N. Security
Council meeting of heads of state, President Bush reaffirmed
the U.N.'s leading role in peacemaking.
   The assignment in India could be an important one. India
and its neighbor Pakistan remain embroiled in a long, bitter
feud that has the potential of becoming one of the world's
few remaining nuclear standoffs.
   Mr. Pickering was one of President Bush's first
ambassadorial appointments. He served at the U.N. during the
time the administration was involved in the delicate
negotiations that led to the formation of the coalition
against Iraq in the Persian Gulf War and the U.N. sanctions
against Saddam Hussein's regime.
   But some senior State Department officials have been
irritated by what they call Mr. Pickering's propensity for
the media spotlight.
   During the 1980s, when the Reagan administration drew the
line against communist-backed insurgences in Central America,
Mr. Pickering played an active role in that effort as U.S.
envoy to El Salvador.
   Mr. Perkins was the U.S. ambassador to South Africa in
1986, when the U.S. imposed economic sanctions against that
nation's white-minority government to pressure it to end
apartheid. Mr. Perkins, who is black, traveled widely across
South Africa during this period, making sure he was seen in
black townships, attending church services and funerals, as
well as in white communities.
   Mr. Pickering, reached over the weekend, refused to
comment on his future plans, and Mr. Perkins couldn't be
reached.
