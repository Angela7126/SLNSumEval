    Paper Profiles, Views New U.S. Ambassador.
   </title>
   <text>
    The new U.S. ambassador to Jordan, Wesley Egan, is
a heavyweight. Once the second man in the U.S. Embassy in 
Cairo, he also served in Saudi Arabia, two African countries, 
and a European nation. His choice for the new job signals the 
importance the United States attaches to Jordan in terms of 
inter-Arab politics and the Arab-Israeli dispute. 
  Before Egan's appointment became final, he had to go through 
a grueling test in the U.S. Senate, where Senator Daniel 
Moynihan, the Zionist Democrat from New York, presided over the 
hearing that scrutinized the would-be ambassador's credentials 
and went on to confirm his nomination. 
  In his testimony, Egan told the hearing he would work to 
develop relations between the United States and Jordan and 
enhance Jordan's role in the peace process. He pointed out that 
Jordan signed a joint agenda with Israel that will presumably 
culminate in a peace treaty between the two countries. 
  His said his top priority in Amman will be to propel the 
peace process forward and recognize Jordan's energetic role in 
the effort to bring about a comprehensive Middle East peace. 
Mr. Egan will pay special attention to stability in Jordan, and 
watch its democratic march and economic development. He will 
also watch Jordan's approach to a number of other issues: human 
rights, compliance with the sanctions resolution against Iraq, 
terminating the boycott of U.S. companies doing business with 
Israel, the potential for foreign investment both in Jordan and 
elsewhere in the region, and the fight against terrorism. 
  Much as I take exception to some of the issues that will 
engage the new ambassador's attention, I concern myself here 
with a lecture Moynihan delivered at the confirmation hearing. 
Discussing the West Bank and Gaza, he dismissed as 
inappropriate the designation attached to them as occupied 
territories, and asked: If these are occupied territories, who 
were they occupied by? These territories, contended the 
senator, were never the sovereign domain of anyone; it was 
Jordan that occupied the West Bank at the founding of the state 
of Israel. What Israel did was to take the West Bank from 
Jordan the way it took Gaza from Egypt. Previously, these 
territories were part of the British mandate, and before that 
they fell within the realm of the Ottoman Empire. Mr. 
Moynihan's point, in other words, is that these territories are 
up for grabs. The United States, he noted, never recognized 
Jordan's sovereignty over the West Bank. His bottom line: 
Israel did not occupy territory that was under another nation's 
sovereignty. 
  This Zionist senator's remarks are not supposed to be 
Washington's official line. However, they do mirror an 
undeclared U.S. line dictated by the all-powerful Zionist lobby 
-- a line that is now all but declared with the bizarre voting 
stance of the United States toward the UN Security Council 
resolution condemning the Hebron massacre.
