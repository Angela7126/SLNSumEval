    McDonald's Outlet In Korea to Target New Middle Class.
   </title>
   <text>
    Two corporate executives sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns. 

   The subject was no laughing matter, but rather the serious endeavor of finding South Korea's Ronald McDonald. 
Seven years after the U.S. hamburger giant first tried to bring its Big Macs to South Korea, the golden arches were finally going up. 
McAhn Industries Ltd. recently opened the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlets in Seoul. 
The company is a 50-50 joint venture of McDonald's Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., and an accountant-turned-entrepreneur, Ahn Hyo Young. 

   McDonald's is flourishing in 11 other nations in the region. 
But its entry into South Korea, which has Asia's fastest-growing economy, had been frustrated by its inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from Seoul on terms. 

   South Korea may be one of McDonald's most promising foreign markets, business analysts say. 
The country is developing an essential ingredient for the success of a fast-food enterprise: a middle class. 

   Hamburger-related fast-food sales in South Korea totaled $87.5 million last year, a 30% rise from 1986, according to the Ministry of Finance. 
Analysts say this year's rise could be much bigger, helped by a 25% increase in wages in mid-1987 and another big pay increase expected soon. 

   The business is likely to profit from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul in September, and from an anticipated post-Olympic economic boom here. 

   However, the competition is heating up, and there is "a good possibility that South Korea already has reached the fast-food saturation point for its current average income bracket," an official for the South Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry says. 
The competition, besides Wendy's International's 11 shops and six of Burger King, a unit of Pillsbury Co., includes home-grown burger chains. 

   McDonald's strategy is to take things slowly, avoiding extravagances, Mr. Ahn and Awad Sifri, McDonald's marketing director, say. 
"We are starting small," says Mr. Ahn. 
"We're hoping to open three outlets this year and five next year. 
After that, we'd like to open five every year." 

   Equally modest, he says, will be the initial menu: no breakfast, no Chicken McNuggets and no products tailored to national tastes, as offered elsewhere. 

   The venture is rejecting television commercials in favor of a cheaper, more oldfashioned approach: a brief advertising campaign in newspapers, distribution of fliers and word of mouth. 

   Mr. Sifri says the emphasis will be on developing McDonald's image as an affordable place for the emerging middle class, rather than as a familiar name for foreigners in South Korea. 
Attention will be given to attracting children, he adds. 

   Mr. Ahn says McDonald's talked to 16 potential partners before choosing the Harvard-trained accountant in 1984. 
Two years later, McDonald's and Mr. Ahn each put up $1 million in capital and borrowed an additional $4 million to form McAhn. 

   McDonald's struggled with the government over McAhn's royalty payments to the U.S. partner -- the issue was resolved -- and over tight import restrictions on food products. 
The import question "came down to finding a supplier locally who could supply high-quality beef and potatoes at a value," McDonald's said. 

   Even McDonald's golden arches symbol ran into red tape, since the city regulates the size and color of signs. 
"It may be against the law, but we're putting them up anyway," Mr. Ahn says.
