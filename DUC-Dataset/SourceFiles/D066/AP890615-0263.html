    Wal-Mart Founder Pitches in at Check-Out Counter.

    Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton
pitched in to help check-out clerks at his store in this Florida
Panhandle city when an electronic glitch shut down the cash
registers.
   The 71-year-old Walton, considered to be one of the world's
richest people, grabbed a note pad Tuesday evening and started
hand-writing merchandise prices for customers so their bills could
be tallied on calculators quickly.
   ``People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him,''
said store manager Paul Sively. ``He shook their hands and talked to
everyone he could. The registers were out for about 45 minutes, and
I don't think we had one customer complain.''
   Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit to
the store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer Jana
Jea in its parking lot. Walton often attends promotional events for
his Arkansas-based chain, and Sively said he had suspected the boss
might make an appearance.
   Walton continued talking with customers during the concert. He
also joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers in
the Wal-Mart cheer.
   ``He was up there saying, `Give me a W, give me an A,' and the
customers went right along with him,'' Sively said. ``He even got
down to do a cheerleader's squiggle.''
