    HURRICANE HUGO MAY BE MOST COSTLY STORM EVER; 2 BIGGEST INSURERS IN CAROLINAS ESTIMATING LOSSES AT $600 MILLION.

     The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday 
that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane 
Hugo. Such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever 
for the insurance industry.
    </p>

     State Farm Insurance Co. expects claims as high as $400 million in South 
Carolina, where it insures one out of every five homes, spokesman Jerry Parsons 
said. The Bloomington, Ill.-based company is also projecting an additional $100 
million in claims from storm damage in North Carolina and Virginia, he said.

     Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 
million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages 
caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and 
Mississippi in 1985.

     "Our previous all-time high was in 1983, when we paid $165 million in 
comparable claims for Hurricane Alicia, which struck Galveston and Houston. 
There were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm, but there was not the 
severity of damage" as in Hugo, Parsons said. Officials said property damage 
from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and 
then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population 
centers, including Charlotte, N.C.

     Losses Still Being Tallied
    </p>
    <p>
     Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in 
North Carolina, where damage was unexpectedly high, and is the third-largest 
insurer in South Carolina. "We have so far received 16,000 claims," spokesman 
Bob Sohozich said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little 
doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 
million in claims paid by the industry after Hurricane Frederic struck 
Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, Parsons said.
    </p>

     The Insurance Information Institute is expected to issue a report Thursday on 
overall insured losses from Hugo. Although the losses are substantial, they are 
not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because 
reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs. For example, 
Nationwide said it would be responsible for up to $30 million in claims, while 
its reinsurers would cover up to $150 million in damages. Reinsurers -- which 
share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the 
premium income -- typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies.

     Analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies, 
which are owned by policyholders, but they noted that losses from Hurricane 
Hugo would also affect the short-term earnings of some publicly traded 
companies.
    </p>

     Continental Corp. said it expects to report a pretax charge of $50 million for 
the third quarter, reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm. The 
New York-based company had substantial business in Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands, where Hugo first struck with devastating force.

     Forecasts May Be Cut

     The charge might push Continental into the red for the quarter, said Udayan 
Ghose, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. "If there is a 
profit, it will be a very small one," he said. The charge will cut expected 
annual earnings by close to 25%, he added.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ghose said Shearson may also cut its third-quarter and annual earnings 
projections for Cigna Corp., USF&amp;G Corp. and Lincoln National Corp., which 
are expected to suffer hurricane-related losses equal to about 10% of expected 
full-year earnings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 billion, 
and analysts expect Hugo to make this year the costliest. But "this could be a 
positive for the industry," Ghose said, explaining that the industry is in the 
middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized. Billions of dollars in 
losses from Hugo and other catastrophes this year would have "a significant 
impact on excess capital," he said, causing insurance firms to raise prices 
shortly.
    </p>

     "That would be good for the companies and shareholders," he said.
