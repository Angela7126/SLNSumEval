    Changsha, June 19 (XINHUA) -- This capital of
central China's Hunan province has been hit by floods in the 
wake of a succession of rainstorms on the upper and middle 
reaches of the Xiangjiang River. 
  The water level of the river, which flows through Changsha, 
is still rising sharply, according to local sources. 
  By four o'clock this afternoon the level recorded at the 
Changsha monitoring station had risen to 38.93 m, some 0.56 m

flood has caused serious losses to people along both banks of 
the river, especially in Changsha, according to the sources.

ground at Yulushan township were flooded when an embankment 
collapsed.

been evacuated to safer places.

area had collapsed, and a total of 128,000 urban and rural 
residents had been affected.

the 
Xihu fishing ground in the Wangyuehu district of Changsha has 
put the lives and property of 60,000 people in danger.
