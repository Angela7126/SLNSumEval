   </title>
   <text>
    Comrade Wen Jiabao [member of CPC Central Committee
Secretariat] and his party left Changsha for Zhuzhou and 
Xiangtan yesterday. He inspected the flooded areas, including 
Zhuzhou City's Xiawan dike, the Hexi New and High Technology 
Development Zone, and Linghuayuan and Xiangtan's Yangtianhu, 
Xingxiadi, Zhoujiangdi, and Shiwandalou, where rescue and relief 
work was in full swing. After listening to reports submitted by 
the two cities on their efforts to fight the flooding and do 
relief work, he issued important instructions. 
  Comrade Wen Jiabao fully affirmed the initial victories that 
the two cities have scored in their flood fighting and relief 
work under the leadership of the provincial party committee and 
government. He said: In fighting floods and doing relief work, 
the broad masses of cadres and people in Zhuzhou and Xiangtan 
sacrificed their interests to rescue a large number of 
industrial and mining enterprises, the Beijing-Guangzhou 
Railway, the 107 National Highway, and cities and thus minimized 
the losses caused by floods. This fully shows that, with party 
leadership and the socialist system, we will be able to overcome 
all difficulties. Regarding the work in the next stage, he 
pointed out: We should continue to take flood fighting and 
relief tasks as the focus of our current work and simultaneously 
do a good job of reform, opening up to the outside world, 
stability, other fields of work, and industrial and agricultural 
production. He said: After the water recedes, we should firmly 
grasp the opportunity and repair the damaged dikes and 
embankments. As the highest flood season has not yet arrived, 
we should be prepared at any time to meet new flood peaks 
head-on rather than slacken our efforts. We should try every 
possible means to provide food, clothing, and shelter to flood 
victims, pay special attention to preventing and curing 
diseases, and concentrate efforts on the resumption of 
production and the reconstruction of homes. He particularly 
stressed: The current flooding has revealed problems in the 
construction of water conservancy facilities and urban flood 
control. In the past, inadequate consideration has been given 
to urban flood control and the coordination of urban and rural 
flood control. In the next step, we should earnestly draw a 
lesson from this negative experience. 
  Governor Chen Bangzhu urged the party committees and 
governments of Zhuzhou and Xiangtan to convey Comrade Wen 
Jiabao's regards and instructions on behalf of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council for the broad masses of cadres 
and people to the party committees and governments at all levels 
as soon as possible, earnestly implement them, and effectively 
carry out the work of fighting floods, doing relief work, and 
helping oneself by engaging in production.
