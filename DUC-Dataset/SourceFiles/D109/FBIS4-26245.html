  Flood water has entered urban and suburban areas of Wuzhou

  This city borders Guangdong and lies on the Xunjiang River, 
the name for the upper reaches of the Xijiang River. 
  The speed of the flood-water was recorded as 46,200 cu 
[cubic] m per second, the most ferocious since the founding of

  The State Council, China's highest governing body, recently 
sent a joint working group formed by the Ministries of Water 
Resources, Construction and Civil Affairs to help fight floods 
in Guangxi and in Guangdong. 
  At 11 o'clock on Saturday, the flood peak on the Xiangjiang 
River passed through Changsha city, capital of central China's 
Hunan Province. 
  The water level recorded at the local monitoring station was

levels were also recorded at Hengyang and Xiangtan cities. 
  About 118 towns of eight prefectures and cities along the 
Xiangjiang River were flooded. 
  Flood water has also entered more than 20 streets and lanes 
of Changsha, and more than 300,000 city dwellers were affected. 
More than 400 factories and 5,000 shops were forced to stop 
production or stop business. 
  More than half a million Armymen and local residents, under 
the leadership of the Hunan provincial party provincial 
committee and provincial people's government, are going all out 
to fight the flood. 
  By 22:00 hours last night, the flood peak passed through

there to combat the floods. 
  The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has 
sent special teams of people to help fight floods in Hunan and 
Jiangxi. 
  Meanwhile, drought is continuing to blight most areas of 
northern China and northeastern China, with about 15.3 million 
hectares of land affected. 
  In the drought-stricken areas, 12 million people and 12 
million head of livestock are short of drinking water, according 
to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
