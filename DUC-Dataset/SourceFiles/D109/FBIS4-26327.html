    Guangzhou, 19 Jun (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general
secretary of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Li Peng, 
premier of the State Council, are very much concerned about 
floods in Guangdong Province. Recently, they repeatedly 
inquired about the flood situation in the Zhu Jiang valley, 
particularly that of Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang. They expressed 
their deep concern for the people in the flood-hit areas, as 
well as extended their warm greetings to the vast number of 
cadres, officers, and men of the People's Liberation Army; armed 
police officers; and public security police who battle on the 
frontline against floods and provide disaster relief. 
  Jiang Zemin and Li Peng gave important directives for 
current 
flood prevention and disaster relief tasks in Guangdong. They 
expressed the hope that under the leadership of the Guangdong 
provincial party committee and government, the Guangdong army 
and people would make concerted efforts in disaster relief; 
earnestly help flood victims solve their living problems; and go 
all out to battle floods to ensure the safety of the Bei Jiang 
dike, Guangzhou city, and the Zhu Jiang Delta.
