    Fuzhou, June 22 (CNS) -- Flood lasting for ten or
more days in Fujian Province has brought about heavy losses in 
agriculture there. According to the latest information offered 
by the Provincial Agricultural Bureau, a total area of 2.465 
million mu of crops have been hit by the flood and of which, 446 
000 mu of crops will have no yield, 1.957 million mu of grain 
have been heavily hit and some 300 million kilogram grain are 
expected to be lost. 
  Among nine cities and prefectures in Fujian, those seriously 
hit by the flood are Sanming, Nanping, Ningde, Fuzhou, Quanzhou 
and Putian. Of these, Sanming City is worst hit by the flood. 
In May, the city was hit by the heavy rainstorm and had big 
losses and now it suffers again from the flood with some 600 000 
mu of crops damaged by flood and 200 million kilogram grain 
expected to be lost. 
  Per capita possession of cultivated land in Fujian is only 
0.05 mu. Even if in the normal years, grain output there is not 
self- sufficient. The consecutive flood has made agricultural 
production situation there more grim. Disaster-relief groups 
have been sent to the flood-stricken areas striving for 
minimizing losses.
