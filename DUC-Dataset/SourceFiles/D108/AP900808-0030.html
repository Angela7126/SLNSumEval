    Worldwide Embargoes Against Iraq Gain Momentum.

    Hitting Baghdad where it hurts, more countries have
joined a U.N.-sanctioned boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   On Tuesday, countries ranging from powerful Japan to neutral
Switzerland to tiny Cyprus cut off petroleum imports in an effort
to convince the Baghdad government to withdraw its troops that
invaded Kuwait on Thursday.
   Turkey announced it was shut down the twin Iraqi oil pipelines
that run through it to the Mediterranean _ carrying half of
Baghdad's crude output _ and cutting off trade with Iraq.
   Baghdad's only other major pipelines exporting crude run through
Saudi Arabia, where the flow has been drastically reduced.
   The U.N. Security Council on Monday voted to impose broad
economic sanctions against Iraq for invading small oil-rich Kuwait.
The measure forbids loans to Iraq or Kuwait and prohibits any
activities, including the transfer of money, that would help the
two countries export their goods.
   Sanctions adopted by the European Economic Community on Saturday
froze Iraqi assets and suspended the purchase of oil from the two
Arab countries. More than 90 percent of imports from Iraq to the
12-nation EEC are petroleum products. The EEC also suspended arms
sales to Iraq.
   Switzerland, which is not a member of the United Nations, made
the unusual move Tuesday of joining the U.N. sanctions and banned
all trade with Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. In addition,
Switzerland prohibited all payments and other financial transfers
to Iraq and Kuwait.
   Denmark, Norway and Sweden also announced embargoes on all trade
with both countries.
   Japan's participation in the U.N. sanctions was seen as
especially key since Tokyo usually has taken a low profile in the
Middle East, which supplies much of its petroleum needs. Japan
imports 99 percent of its oil.
   China joined the U.N. decision to embargo arms sales to Iraq,
but has been less vocal than other major countries in condemning
the invasion. China sold arms to both Iran and Iraq during their
eight-year war and is a major Iraqi trade partner.
   Cyprus' sacrifice in joining the embargo was to give up 70
percent of its oil imports, government spokesman Akis Fantis said.
Cyprus has sufficient oil supplies to last until the end of August,
he said, but ``we are already in the process of taking steps to
secure alternative sources ...''
   The worldwide closing of ranks against Iraqi oil imports is
likely to lead to even higher petroleum prices, which have already
risen dramatically since the invasion and could have a major impact
on the world economy.
   Wholesale oil prices soared to five-year highs in New York on
Monday.
   France will introduce controls Thursday on prices of petroleum
products to prevent refiners from using Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
as an excuse to raise prices, acting Premier Pierre Beregovoy
announced Tuesday.
   An official with the Petroleum Association of Japan said he was
unaware of any increase yet in the price of gasoline for consumers.
The official, who refused to be further identified, said it would
be at least three months before the sanctions could be expected to
force higher gas prices in Japan.
