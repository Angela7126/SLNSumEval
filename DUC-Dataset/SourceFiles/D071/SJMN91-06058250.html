    ON A recent day, the telephone rang in the home of William Wegman. The
photographer, known for his hilarious portraits of his Weimaraners, picked
up.;    "Hello."

    Woof.;    In this house, man and dogs speak as one. Their relationship is
unusually tender. One need only listen while Wegman murmurs to Fay Ray and
Battina, her 1 1/2-year-old daughter.;    On Valentine's Day, for example, he
said, "I'll take them out and play with them longer.";    "But I don't want to
be known as a dog zombie," said Wegman, who did go to the Westminster Kennel
Club Dog Show without the dogs. "I go to movies and have friends and play
sports. I swim, play tennis and wind surf.";    Battina begs to differ. "When
Bill leaves, Batty howls," said Andrea Beeman, an assistant to Wegman.;    Man
and dog;    Their home is one floor of a former Orthodox synagogue on the
Lower East Side of Manhattan. During a recent visit, it was possible to see
how the artist gets two even-tempered, relaxed, normal dogs to slip into
florid housedresses or scratch each other's backs. The three simply adore each
other.;    "I'd never heard of Weimaraners," said the artist, who was born 47
years ago in Longmeadow, Mass. His life with Weimaraners began in 1970, the
year he bought a new video camera and Man Ray, a puppy that cost $35.;   
Wegman had never photographed dogs before, but Man Ray was a perfect subject.;
   "He was gray and neutral," the artist said. "I could do him as a dog, a
man, a sculpture, a character, a bat, a frog, an elephant, an Airedale, a
dinosaur, a poodle. I never got tired of him.";    A dog's life;    Had he
been a different breed he would have been a "character actor," Wegman said,
"like Lassie.";    When Man Ray, who had become world famous, died of cancer
in 1981, at the age of 11 years and 8 months, the artist mourned. "I dreamed
that he came back to life," said Wegman, who spent three years living without
a dog. "It was kind of liberating, the years I didn't have a dog.";    In
1984, however, he got another Weimaraner, which was stolen. Yet another dog
died of Parvo, a virus. In 1985, he got Fay Ray, who is now a familiar face
not only among artists but among children who watch "Sesame Street.";    As a
breed, Weimaraners combine "a lap-dog sensibility with a hunting capability,"
the artist said. They curl up on his lap, but since they are pointers, they
can hold a pose.;    They are also good companions for an artist. They are
affectionate. They do not drool. They have style.;    Like world-famous
fashion models, these dogs are lean, supple and fit. In Wegman's home, which
comprises 2,000 square feet with 20-foot-high ceilings, they live a life
unencumbered -- one assumes -- by thoughts of fame or fortune, and seldom
hunger.;    Each morning Wegman feeds them Eukanuba dog food, which he
considers the best around. "It's the highest in protein." he said. He often
adds a spoonful of plain yogurt or cottage cheese. The dogs eat again at 6
p.m.;    The house is designed for both human and canine comfort. There is
nowhere that Wegman goes that the dogs do not. The yard is a run of dirt and
concrete. If their master does not play with them, the dogs just scratch,
sniff, get bored and go to the door to wait for him.
