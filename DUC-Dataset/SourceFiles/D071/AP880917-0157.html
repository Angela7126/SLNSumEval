    Thousands of Israelis Turn Out For Dog Show.

    Taking a break from the headaches of the
Palestinian uprising and Israel's election campaign, thousands of
Israelis turned out Saturday for a canine beauty pageant.
   Marco, a feisty boxer owned by Dov Amir, padded off with the
champion's trophy after beating out 800 other pretty pooches in
Israel's dog-of-the-year contest held in Tel Aviv's Exhibition
Center.
   ``We can find time for other things besides the intefadeh,''
said organizer Avi Marshak, using the Arabic word for uprising to
describe the 9-month-old wave of Palestinian violence aimed at
ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   About 20,000 people attended the two-day show, organizers said.
   Israeli couples in cutoff jeans and short-sleeved shirts pushed
baby strollers from ring to ring to view the more than 50 different
breeds ranging from tiny lap dogs like the Yorkshire terriers to
Great Danes and St. Bernards.
   Marshak said the contest was sanctioned by the World Kennel Club
based in Brussels, Belgium, and had judges from the Netherlands,
South Africa, Italy and Britain.
   But although the competition was billed as an international
event, organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from
abroad. This was in contrast to 1987, before the uprising began,
when a World Dog Show competition attracted scores of foreign
competitors to Israel.
   ``Even so, we don't feel the intefadeh here,'' said Rafi Shahaf,
a veterinarian, who was interviewed in the show ring where Conan,
his steel gray Mastino Napoletano, had just taken a blue ribbon.
   The show briefly pushed the Nov. 1 general elections out of the
limelight for the doglovers. Experts say the razor-tight race
between the right-wing Likud Party and the left-leaning Labor Party
could determine the future of the Israeli-occupied Palestinian
lands.
