    It's a dog's life for Bill McFadden.;    The 32-year-old professional dog
handler knows that the secret to producing champions is just plain, doggone
hard work. He puts in 18-hour days grooming and conditioning his charges. And,
like a racehorse jockey, he crisscrosses the country showing the dogs for a
variety of owners.

    McFadden and his wife, Taffe, run their dog handling business in Campbell
and do it primarily for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings. Those who
think you can get rich handling dogs are barking up the wrong tree.;    "We
make a good living but the overhead is high and the hours long. Before a show
we sometimes work around the clock brushing and cleaning the dogs, working on
their coats," said McFadden. "And breeds such as poodles have to be highly
trimmed.";    McFadden said he handles an average of 20 to 25 dogs at each
show and works around 120 shows a year all over the U.S. The dogs are frequent
winners in best of breed and best of show categories. "We finish with close to
100 champions a year," he said.;    As a handler, McFadden emphasizes that he
doesn't do obedience training. His job is to trim and condition the dogs and
prepare them physically and mentally. The aim, he said, is to have a
"confident and happy dog" entering a competition.;    Over the last seven
years, McFadden and his wife have shown dogs representing approximately 75
percent of the 135 breeds of dog. Taffe McFadden, a Vancouver, British
Columbia native who has been involved in dog handling since she was a child,
specializes in poodles. The couple also owns two standard poodles and breed
wire fox terriers.;    McFadden's latest product, a Kerry blue terrier named
Kerrageen's Hotspur, won the best of show prize at the 81st Golden Gate Kennel
Club Dog Show held Feb. 2-3 at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. More than
2,000 purebred dogs participated in the national competition.;    It was the
37th best in show win by Kerrageen's Hotspur, making him the top Kerry blue
terrier of all time. The dog is owned by Bryan Percy and Judy Hertwell of
Seattle.;    Kerrageen's Hotspur was scheduled to join McFadden in New York
City last week for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square
Garden. Recognized as one of the most prestigious shows in all of dogdom,
Westminster is also, with the exception of the Kentucky Derby, the longest
continuous sporting event held in the U.S.
