    Contributions for Iranian Relief Light, Expected to Pick Up.

    Americans who rushed to donate money to help victims of the
Armenian earthquake 18 months ago are responding more slowly to
last week's killer earthquake in Iran. But relief agencies said
they expect contributions to pick up.
   ``There's a hierarchy of responsiveness,'' said Dick Colenso,
associate executive director of World Concern, a private relief
agency based in Seattle. ``Something happens in Europe, there's a
very large response, Asia, a pretty good respons
down to the Middle East ... thee. When you get dynamics change.''
   Colenso said, however, that contributions will ``surge upward''
as news spreads of the earthquake's destruction.
   ``As ... you get the disaster translated into the lives of
individuals instead of mass numbers, people begin to respond. They
relate to that,'' he said.
   At least 50,000 people were reported killed and 200,000 injured
in the earthquake that struck Thursday.
   AmeriCares, a private agency based in New Canaan, Conn., brought
the first shipment of supplies from the United States into Iran on
Sunday.
   The shipment was the first of its kind to be accepted by Iran
since the hostage crisis of 1979-80, when 52 Americans were held at
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Iran is believede-scale structure in the universe.
   AWARDS: National Award for Science and Technology, 1978; Chinese
Academy of Sciences Award 1982; New York Academy of Sciences Award,
1988.
   POLITICAL DISSENT: Fang became politically prominent during the
pro-democracy student demonstrations of 1986-87. His speeches to
students at the University of Science and Technology in Hefei in
central China, where he was vice president, helped incite the
protests, party hard-liners said.
   Fang was expelled from the Communist Party in 1957, when he said
Marxist theory on physics was obsolete. In 1987, he was fired from
his Hefei university posts. In between, in 1966, he was a victim of
the Cultural Revolution purges and was sent to a communal farm for
``re-education.''
   After the June 4, 1989, military crackdown on the democracy
movement, Fang and Li obtained refuge in the U.S. Embassy.
