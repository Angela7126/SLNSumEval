    FANS AND FAMOUS -- ALL LOVED LUCY.
   </title>
   <text>
    <p>
     Presidents, famous actors, television executives, neighbors and tourists all 
had their memories. Some had known her; most had not.
    </p>
    <p>
     In form their sentiments ranged from flowers to telegrams to hand-lettered 
signs. Through them all ran a single, constant thread.
    </p>
    <p>
     They all said they loved Lucy, and they'll miss her.
    </p>
    <p>
     From former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan: "Lucille Ball was a gifted 
comedienne who brought laughter to millions the world over. Her red hair, her 
antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an American 
institution."
    </p>
    <p>
     Reagan's successor extended his "deepest sympathy" to Miss Ball's family and 
called her a "legendary figure." "We too loved Lucy. So did the world," 
President Bush said in a statement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucille Ball had last appeared in public in March at the Academy Awards 
ceremony. Her co-presenter was Bob Hope, who a few hours after her death said 
simply, "God has her now, but thanks to television, we'll have her forever."
    </p>
    <p>
     The scene on North Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills where Miss Ball spent her 
last and what she said were her happiest years was one of curiousity coupled 
with genuine mourning. About 20 people gathered on the sidewalk, some snapping 
photographs of the home and of the dozen television crews standing outside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Andy Stern, a neighbor, said that the large white house surrounded by 
snapdragons and bougainvillea was the most popular of all the homes on the 
Hollywood Stars' tours: "They (the buses) stop at her house more than any 
other."
    </p>
    <p>
     Another neighbor, Bob Rosati, said he was watching a rerun of "I Love Lucy" 
when the screen went black and the words "In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989" 
appeared. "I felt I had lost someone in my family," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Karen Pope, who described herself as an aspiring actress, drove from her Los 
Angeles home with a little container of flowers and a sign that read: "Lucy is 
seen in the smile of everyone's eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
     She left them with a guard at Miss Ball's home, turned away and said quietly: 
"She's touched all of us. She's not gone. She's just playing to a larger 
audience."
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of the people outside the house were like Karen Mestichelli from 
Philadelphia, a tourist who had purchased a map to the neighborhoods where many 
of the entertainment greats live. "This is the first house we stopped at," she 
said. "I loved her. She was good."
    </p>
    <p>
     In Paris, entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. called Miss Ball a "great artist -- one 
of the world's greatest clowns."
    </p>
    <p>
     In Boston, comedian Lily Tomlin said: "It's a sad day for me. She was a great 
role model for me and a great funny woman."
    </p>
    <p>
     Comedian George Burns, another friend of many years, said, "As long as the 
world goes on, Lucy will be seen."
    </p>
    <p>
     Burns likened Miss Ball's death to that of his wife, Gracie Allen. "When Gracie 
died, it was a shock to me," he said. "This is a shock. Lucy and Gracie had one 
quality exactly alike. They both dressed like ladies and were very feminine."
    </p>
    <p>
     Television and film actor Danny DeVito recalled getting a personal 
congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for his work on the 
TV series "Taxi."
    </p>
    <p>
     "It made it like it had been blessed," he recalled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing," said "Saturday 
Night Live" comedian Victoria Jackson, who was born two years after the "I Love 
Lucy" show went off the air as a regular series. "She didn't make me laugh out 
loud, I remember, she just made me happy about life."
    </p>
    <p>
     From William S. Paley, chairman of CBS Inc., where "I Loved Lucy" reigned for 
all those years: "Lucille Ball will always be the first lady of CBS. With 'I 
Love Lucy,' she helped establish television as the nation's leading 
entertainment medium. Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up the screen and 
brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever."
    </p>
    <p>
     And then there were those at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where she died. They 
had admired her as a celebrity for years but known her as a person for only 
days.
    </p>
    <p>
     A bouquet of red roses had been left in front of the center's north tower and 
calls were coming in from all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The telephone is ringing off the hook. People crying on the phone," said 
hospital spokeswoman Paula Correia. "It's a massive outpouring of grief from 
all ages."
    </p>
    <p>
     Maureen LaMour, a hospital admittance representative, said she heard the news 
of Miss Ball's death on her way to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We (the staff) always kept in touch with how she was doing and kept up with 
all the gifts and cards she received, because it was like they were for a 
family member," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Everyone has grown up with her. Our children have grown up with her. She's a 
legend. It's like losing a friend, a family member, instead of a celebrity."
