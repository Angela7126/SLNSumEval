    LUCILLE BALL DIES AT 77; THE WHOLE WORLD LOVED LUCY DURING TV'S GOLDEN AGE; SUFFERS AORTA RUPTURE AFTER HEART SURGERY.
   </title>
   <text>
    <p>
     Lucille Ball, the leggy showgirl, model and B-grade movie queen whose 
pumpkin-colored hair and genius for comedy made her an icon of television's 
early years, died early today, a week after undergoing emergency heart surgery. 
She was 77.
    </p>
    <p>
     The high-spirited star of "I Love Lucy," a show that the nation took to its 
heart as no other and that continues in syndication around the world, died of a 
ruptured abdominal aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital spokesman 
Ronald Wise said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Ball, who had a heart attack and had throat surgery in 1988, underwent 
surgery at Cedars-Sinai on April 18 to replace her aorta and aortic valve and 
had been getting out of bed, eating and even walking around the room in recent 
days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her recovery had seemed so certain that her husband, comedian Gary Morton, had 
been exchanging jokes with his wife. She had been asking about their white 
poodle, Tinker.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wise said the rupture occurred in a portion of the aorta, the main heart 
artery, far from where the operation was performed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since the surgery fans had flooded the hospital with hundreds of cards, 
telegrams and even facsimile machine messages. Hospital officials said it was 
the largest outpouring they had ever seen.

     'Name Brings a Smile'
    </p>
    <p>
     Tributes were plentiful and immediate:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made 
her an American institution," former President and Nancy Reagan said in a 
statement. "Just the mention of her name brings a smile. ... We love Lucy and
will miss her deeply."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, what a blow. What a shame," said fellow TV clown Dick Van Dyke. "She 
didn't deal in jokes, she dealt in human behavior. She was a great physical 
mime with all the instincts of a Chaplin."
    </p>
    <p>
     William S. Paley, chairman of CBS Inc., said from New York: "Lucille Ball will 
always be the first lady of CBS. With 'I Love Lucy' she helped establish 
television as the nation's leading entertainment medium. Lucy's extraordinary 
ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will 
last forever."
    </p>
    <p>
     That legacy involved Miss Ball and her late former husband, Cuban band leader 
Desi Arnaz. They starred regularly from 1951 to 1957 as Lucy and Ricky Ricardo 
in "I Love Lucy." The late Vivian Vance and William Frawley played their 
neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz.
    </p>
    <p>
     The series continued irregularly into the early 1960s.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Talent as Entrepreneur
    </p>
    <p>
     Her singularity as a comedian was matched by her talent as a show-business 
entrepreneur. She and Arnaz established one of TV's first major independent 
studios.
    </p>
    <p>
     Desilu, as their production company was called, made some of the top comedy 
shows of the 1950s and '60s, including "December Bride," "Our Miss Brooks" and 
"Make Room for Daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
     As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and Arnaz signed an 
$8-million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with CBS in 1953 -- the largest 
in television history at the time and a figure scarcely any TV star can touch 
36 years later.
    </p>
    <p>
     The actress was last seen introducing the "Young Hollywood" production number 
with Bob Hope at the 61st Academy Awards ceremony March 29, receiving a 
standing ovation. Looking svelte for her years in a fashionable slit skirt, she 
seemed to be in good health and laughed freely throughout a brief routine with 
Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her last series -- "Life With Lucy," co-starring frequent sidekick Gale Gordon 
-- was carried by ABC at the start of the 1986 season. But the show, Miss 
Ball's first series in 12 years, was canceled after less than two months when 
it drew spectacularly low ratings. Miss Ball also played a bag lady in the 1985 
TV movie "Stone Pillow," considered one of the most challenging roles of her 
career. Her timing, wails and pratfalls had made the "I Love Lucy" show one of 
the most popular in television history.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bridge clubs and bowling teams changed their meeting nights to watch Lucy 
Ricardo and Ethel Mertz come up with yet another harebrained scheme to drive 
their long-suffering husbands, Ricky and Fred, to desperation.

     On-Screen Pregnancy
    </p>
    <p>
     A Chicago department store changed the night it stayed open because shoppers 
were staying home to watch television.
    </p>
    <p>
     Miss Ball's real, on-screen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an 
estimated 44 million viewers -- more than watched the inauguration of President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower -- tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, the night Lucy Ricardo 
delivered Little Ricky. Her real son was born just four hours before the 
previously filmed show was broadcast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucille Ball was born in Jamestown, N.Y., the daughter of an electrician and a 
concert pianist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Young Lucy, a natural brunette, was dazzled by the stage, but her ambitions 
were discouraged by an acting school -- "They sent my mother a letter saying 
she was wasting her money" -- and she turned to modeling under the name Diane 
Belmont.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her ads for Chesterfield cigarettes caught the attention of Hollywood, and in 
1933 she was off to California. As a blonde, she appeared with the Marx 
Brothers in "Room Service," with Fred Astaire in "Follow the Fleet" and with 
Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers in "Stage Door."
    </p>
    <p>
     In all, she appeared in more than 75 movies.
    </p>

     CBS Wary of Arnaz
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1940, her tresses now the fiery trademark red, Miss Ball met Arnaz, a rumba 
star. They married within six months.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1951, when CBS decided to move her radio series, "My Favorite Husband," to 
television, Miss Ball insisted that Arnaz be her co-star. But the network 
wasn't sure that Arnaz would be a hit with the American public.
    </p>
    <p>
     The couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved that audiences would 
sit still to watch a leggy, blue-eyed comedian and a Cuban-born band leader 
with a heavy accent. CBS relented and her antics became comedy classics: Lucy 
putting too much yeast in the bread, which quickly fills up her kitchen and 
pins her against the wall; Lucy fighting with a fellow grape-presser in a giant 
wine-making vat; Lucy rehearsing a commercial for a health tonic and becoming 
drunk from its alcohol content.
    </p>
    <p>
     The show also revolutionized television sitcom production in the days before 
videotape. It was filmed in advance before a live audience, employing three 
cameras instead of the traditional one used for motion pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
     Filming the shows also made them marketable as reruns, and they continue to be 
seen in more than 80 countries.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite riches and two children, Lucie and Desi Jr., both of whom became 
actors, the marriage foundered, and the couple divorced in 1960.
    </p>
    <p>
     Arnaz died in 1986, Miss Vance in 1979 and Frawley in 1966.
