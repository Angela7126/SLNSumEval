    Lucille Ball Memorials: Fans Shed Tears for Woman Who Made Them Laugh.

   <text>
    Thousands of Lucille Ball's fans shed tears
for the woman who made them laugh, as three cities held memorial
services in which the redheaded comedian was remembered with
prayers and applause.
   ``She was a whole package. There never will be another one like
her. I love her,'' said a tearful Carol Burnett following a
memorial Mass in suburban Santa Monica.
   More than a thousand people who packed the St. Monica's Catholic
Church rose to their feet and clapped for several minutes after
television minister the Rev. Robert Schuller asked them to
``applaud the Lord for Lucille Ball.''
   About 1,000 people also crowded a church in New York and 200
gathered in a Chicago church. All three memorial Masses began at 8
p.m. Monday, the time Miss Ball's three most popular programs were
often broadcast.
   The 77-year-old comedian who starred in one of television's
biggest all-time hits, ``I Love Lucy,'' died here April 26 of a
ruptured aorta, a major blood vessel, eight days after emergency
open-heart surgery.
   Miss Ball, known for her honed comedic timing, wide-mouthed
expressions and wacky antics, was popular among generations of fans
who watched ``I Love Lucy'' as a first-run show in the '50s and in
three decades of reruns.
   ``She showed her love in the only way she knew how, by making
you laugh,'' the Rev. James Fox told those gathered for the Roman
Catholic Mass at St. Ignatius Loyola in New York.
   Broadcaster Diane Sawyer told the crowd that the death of Miss
Ball may have settled a longstanding theological debate over
whether there is laughter in heaven.
   ``A God who would have created her would never let her laughter
be far from Him,'' said Ms. Sawyer.
   In Chicago, the Rev. Jack Wall told people at Old St. Patrick
Church that God gave the world talents like Miss Ball ``to show us
life is not a tragedy, but a comedy with a happy ending.''
   ``She taught us that if we could love Lucy, we could love
ourselves,'' Wall said.
   In announcing the services, Miss Ball's family said: ``Monday
night was the time when most of the nation was used to being with
Lucy.''
   Two of the three long-running comedy shows in which Miss Ball
starred, ``The Lucy Show'' and ``Here's Lucy,'' aired Monday
nights. ``I Love Lucy'' had starting times on Mondays and other
days.
   ``Lucille Ball gave the gift of humor which produced
happiness,'' said Schuller at the Santa Monica service. ``Only God
knows how many husbands and wives weren't speaking _ and then
Monday night rolled around.''
   Fans lined up to get in the Santa Monica church as much as four
hours early. Florists delivered arrangements including a 3-foot
heart of red carnations with the words ``I Love Lucy'' written
across.
   Hundreds of people came forward during Holy Communion to receive
blessings from three priests, including a woman wearing an ``I Love
Lucy'' T-shirt.
   ``I think she would have loved it very much, and she lived her
life for the people who were in that room tonight,'' said Lucie
Arnaz, daughter of Miss Ball and the late Desi Arnaz.
   Gary Morton, Miss Ball's husband for more than two decades,
attended a private service for his wife last month. The actress'
remains were buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.
