    Little Ricky, Now 38, Remembers Lucy as Surrogate Mom.

    The actor who played Little Ricky on the
``I Love Lucy'' show said Wednesday he spent more time with Lucille
Ball than he did with his own family in the five years he played
the comedian's TV son.
   Miss Ball died of a ruptured aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles Wednesday morning, hospital officials said.
She was 77.
   ``She was old and, of course, I knew about the heart attack, so
I was not shocked by her death,'' said Keith Thibodeaux, who at age
6 began playing Miss Ball's drum-playing son on the comedy series
that continues in syndication around the world. ``I'm sure all this
is going to hit me a little later on.''
   Thibodeaux grew up on the set, playing Little Ricky from 1956
until 1961 under Miss Ball's watchful eye.
   ``I think the thing I remember most about Lucy was that she was
very much in control of everything,'' said Thibodeaux, who began
playing the drums at age 2, was a professional drummer at age 4 and
is now drummer with David and the Giants, a Christian rock group.
He lives in Jackson with his wife, Kathy, a ballerina.
   Thibodeaux, 38, said he got his break in show business when big
band leader Horace Heidt persuaded his father to bring him from
Lafayette, La., to California for the ``Swift Premium Hour,'' a
traveling radio show that led to a string of one-night stands
across the country.
   That led to an audition for the ``I Love Lucy'' role in
Hollywood.
   ``I remember Lucy saying, `that's him,' and from that time I was
Little Ricky,'' said Thibodeaux, who then used the name Richard
Keith. ``I signed a seven-year contract with the studio in 1956 and
the first episode I was in was aired that December with Bob Hope _
I just turned 6.''
   Thibodeaux said that during the series' run he spent as much
time with Miss Ball as with his own family in Lafayette.
   ``And I spent more time with her off the set at her home than at
the studio,'' he said. ``I remember her as very strict but with a
lot of love. She had her ways but despite all, she was a great
person, very, very talented.
   ``I know everybody remembers her as zany and wacky but that was
only on the show. Actually, she was just the opposite and was very
serious. ... That's what made her a great actress.''
   He said Miss Ball often gave him gifts and that he remembers
spending at least one Christmas at her home.
   ``I remember she once gave me an Indian tepee, then my own
dressing room,'' he said. ``She gave me bicycles and an identical
set of drums.''
