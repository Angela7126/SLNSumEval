    Memorial Services Remember Five Slain Children.

    Grieving relatives and friends gathered
at memorial services Saturday to mourn the five school children
slain by a camouflage-garbed, suicidal drifter.
   ``Although there are some people in the United States who do bad
things, most of the people in the United States do good things,''
said Patricia Busher, principal of Cleveland Elementary School,
where the killings and the woundings of 29 students and one teacher
happened last Tuesday.
   ``The tragedy that occurred at our school could have happened
anywhere. There is no way to protect us from this kind of tragedy
... this senseless tragedy. In time, some of the cutting edge of the
pain will go away,'' Busher said.
   Her speech, at a memorial service attended by 200 people for the
four Cambodian children killed, was translated as she spoke into the
Cambodian language.
   ``Tragedy has followed you,'' state Sen. John Garamendi told the
families, refugees from a country where more than 1 million people
were killed in executions and enforced hardship after a 1975
communist takeover.
   The service, held in Central Methodist Church, was for 8-year-old
Oeun Lim, 9-year-old Rathanan Or, 8-year-old Ram Chun and 6-year-old
Sokhim An.
   During the morning, a Catholic funeral mass and burial were held
for 6-year-old Thuy Tran, daughter of Vietnamese refugees.
   Another memorial service for the four Cambodians was planned
Sunday at a mortuary.
   Gov. George Deukmejian planned to speak at a service Monday
morning for all five children at Stockton Civic Auditorium. People
attending that service were asked to follow a Southeast Asian
cultural tradition and wear black-and-white ribbons.
   Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a gun on himself after firing
more than 100 rounds from an AK-47 semi-automatic assault rifle at
Cleveland Elementary, where he had attended grade school, was buried
Friday in an unmarked grave in a family plot at Lodi.
   Ten of the wounded children and the wounded teacher remained
hospitalized Saturday. Three children were discharged Friday.
   Stockton police said they have located all of Purdy's close
relatives, except for his mother, identified as 43-year-old Kathy
Snyder. Police said she has had four different surnames and that
when she renewed her driver's license a year ago, she used an
address in La Mesa that turned out to be a chemical shed.
