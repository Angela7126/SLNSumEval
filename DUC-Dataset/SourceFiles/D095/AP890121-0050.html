    Prayers, Counseling in Aftermath of School Shooting.
   </title>
   <text>
    Grief-stricken family and friends mourned
the deaths of five school children gunned down during recess, while
the killer was buried nearly unnoticed in a nearby town.
   Parents and teachers continued counseling the children who
witnessed Tuesday's schoolyard slayings, trying to help them deal
with the tragedy.
   Patrick Purdy, 24, opened fire outside the Cleveland Elementary
School with an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle, firing more than
100 rounds, killing five children and wounding 29 others and one
teacher.
   Three days and nights of prayer began Thursday for two of the
youngsters killed, and services for the other children were being
held today and Monday. Gov. George Deukmejian was to attend Monday's
services.
   Purdy was buried Friday in nearby Lodi, said his grandmother,
Julia Chumbley. He was interred following a service at Cherokee
Memorial Cemetery, which several of his relatives attended, she said.
   Fourteen of the wounded students were still hospitalized, but
most were reported in improved conditions.
   At Cleveland School, about three-quarters of the school's 970
pupils had returned to classes by Friday, about three times the
number who attended Wednesday, but it was anything but a routine
school day.
   Counselors and school psychologists were assisting teachers in
classrooms, and some parents sat in with their children to comfort
and reassure them.
   One mother, who asked not to be identified, told reporters that
her youngest son, a 7-year-old second grader who was on playground
when the shootings occurred, would only come back to school if she
stayed with him.
   ``They're making it back, slowly but surely,'' she said, adding
that she planned to spend Friday as she did Thursday, at her son's
side in the classroom.
   Cleveland School is in the heart of California's third-largest
community of refugees from Southeast Asia, and nearly two-thirds of
the school's population is from Asia. All of the dead children were
from refugee families, as were 19 of the 29 wounded.
   School authorities said they were particularly concerned that the
killing might not only revive the psychological trauma of the
horrors they experienced in Southeast Asia, but that those families
might flee from the area without accepting counseling if they feared
a racial motive in the attack.
   ``We want to pass the word to the community that this is not a
racist act ... It could happen to anybody, anywhere, anytime. This
is a crazy action from one individual. It is not racism,'' said An
Tran of the Southeast Asian Refugee Resettlement Program.
   Stockton Police Capt. Dennis Perry also repeated that there was
no evidence that Purdy, who committed suicide after the attack, was
specifically targeting Asians.
   ``It wasn't any one race or group of people. He hated
everybody,'' Perry said of Purdy, who as a child 14 years earlier
had attended Cleveland School.
