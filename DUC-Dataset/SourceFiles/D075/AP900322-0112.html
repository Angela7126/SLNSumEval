    Study Finds Drug Lowers Death Risk After Heart Attack.

    A drug that eases the heart's workload can
cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in
people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study
released Thursday.
   The study, conducted in Denmark, found that the drug Verapamil,
known as a calcium channel blocker, was effective for the 1{ years
after a heart attack. Calcium blockers are among several classes of
medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure.
   ``This is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blocker
may be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction,'' or heart
attack, said Dr. Carl J. Pepine of the University of Florida.
   Several other studies of calcium blockers, including one large
U.S. study published last year, failed to find any benefit from
using the medicines after heart attacks.
   According to the Danish study, Verapamil is about as effective
as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta
blockers at protecting people after heart attacks.
   While calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heart
attacks, the researchers said these drugs still should have a role
in treatment.
   ``We feel it is important to have alternatives. Many patients do
not tolerate beta blockers,'' said Dr. Kresten Mellemgaard of
Central County Hospital in Hillerod, Denmark, a co-author of the
study.
   Beta blockers are generally not recommended for people with
asthma and emphysema. This means the drugs often cannot be given to
cigarette smokers, who are frequent victims of heart attacks.
   In the study, conducted at 20 community hospitals, doctors
compared 897 patients who got Verapamil after heart attacks with
878 people who took placebos.
   After 18 months of followup, there were 146 deaths or recurring
heart attacks among the Verapamil patients, compared with 180 in
people who got the dummy medication.
   ``We wanted to see if an effect would be observed with
Verapamil,'' said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen of Copenhagen Municipal
Hospital.
   ``If it had an effect, it should be seen in the first 12 to 18
months, because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardial
infarction in this period,'' he said. ``Then it levels off. That's
what we demonstrated. It worked.''
   The researchers believe that by reducing the amount of work
needed by the heart to sustain circulation, calcium blockers
lowered the chances of ischemia, episodes in which the heart's own
muscle is deprived of oxygen.
   They said they were unsure why earlier studies failed to show
any benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks. However,
they noted that some studies enrolled patients who were also taking
beta blockers. And this might have obscured any benefits from
calcium blockers.
   The results were presented at a meeting of the American College
of Cardiology. Among other research described at the meeting:
   Dr. James H. Chesebro of the Mayo Clinic said a five-year study
found that aspirin does not stop the continued buildup of existing
blockages in the arteries feeding the heart, although it may
modestly protect against the development of new deposits. However,
like other studies, this one found that aspirin signficantly cut
the risk of heart attacks.
   Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard Medical School said the next
phase of a large study of clot-dissolving drugs will see what
effect they have in unstable angina. This is a condition in which
people suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered by work
or stress. Until now, the drugs have been used only to treat heart
attacks.
