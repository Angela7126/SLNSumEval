    Growth Factor Protects Heart Following Attack, Study In Rats Shows.

    A natural substance called transforming growth
factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells
following a heart attack, according to a study published in the
journal Science.
   In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a
group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50
percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth
factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta.
   ``TGF beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys
following a heart attack,'' said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, a professor at
Jefferson.
   Lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in 24 rats
by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts.
   In 12 of the rats, the researchers injected a placebo. In the
other 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta.
   For those who received the TGF beta, said Lefer, ``the damage
from the attack was much less severe. There was about 50 percent
less injury with TGF beta than without it.''
   The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the
amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack.
Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heart
attack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer. Thus, by
measuring for the loss of this substance, researchers could
determine the amount of heart damage.
   Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other
substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood
vessels to narrow following a heart attack. Narrowed blood vessels
carry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this causes additional
injury following a heart attack.
   TGF beta is normally present in heart cells, but the study
published in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cells
damaged by a simulated heart attack.
   Though TGF beta is produced naturally in the body, Lefer said
his research team used a substance produced artificially by
Genentech, a California biotechnology firm.
   Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with
TGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack
victims with the substance is at least a year away.
   Jefferson Medical College, where the study was done, is part of
Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
   Science, which published the study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
