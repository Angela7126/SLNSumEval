    Study Says Emergency Heart Procedure Unnecessary After Heart Attacks.
   </title>

    The expensive practice of using balloon
catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart
attacks, now routinely done at many large hospitals, is unnecessary
and should be abandoned, according to a major study released Tuesday.
   The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive
clot-dissolving drugs, they usually don't need the extra step of the
common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.
   Some experts said the results are good news, because they mean
that most heart attack patients can be treated in community
hospitals, where angioplasty is not available.
   The study also has an important financial message. Its authors
estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart
attacks, it could raise the nation's annual medical bills by $704
million.
   ``This trial has settled one of the most important questions in
modern-day cardiology,'' commented Dr. J. Ward Kennedy of the
University of Washington, Seattle.
   The study is phase 2 of the Thrombolysis in Miocardial Infarction
Trial, or TIMI-II, directed by Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston.
   The first phase of the study showed that giving people a
clot-dissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA,
immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances
of survival.
   The latest study, presented at the annual meeting of the American
Heart Association, was intended to see whether people did better
still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after
giving TPA.
   At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomly
assigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their
heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might
benefit. Sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure,
which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heart
arteries to squeeze them open.
   A comparison group of 1,626 also got TPA. But they were not
considered for angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain or
abnormal exercise tests during their recovery.
   After 42 days, 11 percent of those in the angioplasty group had
died or suffered further heart attacks, as did 10 percent of those
in the comparison group.
   A year after the treatment, there was no difference in survival.
About 93 percent of both groups were still alive.
   ``There does not appear to be any additional benefit from
angioplasty,'' Braunwald said.
   Dr. Thomas J. Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented,
``We have the answer in this trial to a very important question of
health care delivery.''
   While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs to heart
attack patients, most of them do not have the sophisticated labs
where angioplasty is performed.
   If the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves
survival, it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would
need to be established and more doctors trained to give the
procedure.
   ``The watch word is watchful waiting'' to see if patients need
angioplasty. ``This ultimately makes it possible for patients to be
treated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary care
centers if angioplasty is needed,'' said Dr. Howard Morgan,
immediate past president of the heart association.
   Heart attacks occur when a clot blocks an artery that feeds the
heart muscle. The purpose of TPA and similar drugs is to dissolve
these clots before the muscle dies. To be effective, the drugs must
be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack
symptoms.
   Experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victims
are considered to be candidates for the drugs. Many people delay
going to the hospital until permanent damage occurs. In others, the
treatment may be considered too dangerous because of recent surgery
or a history of strokes.
   Balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people with
clogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks. The
latest study did not question the usefulness of this kind of
angioplasty.
