    Mother Clings to Hope that 12-Year-Old Daughter is Alive.

    The mother of a 12-year-old girl swept
away by a flash flood was clinging to hope that her daughter was
alive but perhaps unable to get home, a family friend said Saturday.
   Janice Trigg's daughter, Kerri, was among nearly three dozen
still missing Saturday night, two days after the floods hit eastern
Ohio.
   ``She keeps saying Kerri Jo may have amnesia, or she can't move
to get help. That's a mother's hope,'' said the friend, Betty
Kreiter, 67.
   Searchers for the missing used trained dogs to sniff through the
rubble and along the banks of the Wegee and Pipe creeks, which
empty into the Ohio River, in an effort that stretched five miles
south of this town.
   Workers also sifted through debris that collected at the
Hannibal locks and dam on the Ohio River, about 25 miles south.
   Relatives of the missing were staying with friends and family,
said the Rev. Robert Gracey, who was counseling flood victims at a
school turned into a relief center.
   Kerri had been playing at a friend's house when the one-story
home suddenly was washed away in the flood Thursday night.
   The friend, 9-year-old Amber Colvin, was swept down Wegee Creek
and into the Ohio River, but survived a seven-mile ordeal by
clinging to logs.Amber was released from a hospital Saturday after
treatment for minor injuries.
   She said she last saw Kerri when the two, alone in the house,
jumped into a bathtub for safety in the storm. The tub was washed
into the creek.
   Throughout the town, there were stories of fear, luck and close
calls. Deanna Hulderman, 48, said she and her husband, Clancey,
were pulled under by Wegee Creek flood water at a bar but were
reunited about a half-hour later.
   Mrs. Hulderman said she, her husband and about seven others were
in the 3Ks bar when a wall collapsed and water rushed through.
   ``I saw my husband go under and get washed away. He was yelling
how much he loved me, and then I went under,'' Mrs. Hulderman said.
``I began praying `God, don't let me die like this,' and the next
thing I knew I was standing on my feet, and the water went down.''
   Mrs. Hulderman said firefighters rescued her husband at the
mouth of the creek near the Ohio River.
   Capt. James Boling of the Ohio National Guard said local
authorities told him some of the bar patrons remained unaccounted
for.
   Kathy Schramm, 37, said she, her husband and their two children
fled their two-story house before water washed through. When they
returned, the basement and first floor were flooded, and the
surrounding area ``looked like a big lake.''
   ``I looked up at a house on the hill, and it looked like it was
on stilts on the water,'' Mrs. Schramm said.
