    Searchers Find 21st Flood Victim; Little Hope for Missing.
   </title>
   <text>
    The death toll from last week's flash
floods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the Ohio River,
and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people still
listed as missing.
   ``It's just been too long. I don't think there's anybody alive
out there. You can't swim out there that long in the Ohio River,''
said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.
   The search for the missing was suspended briefly this morning
when a thunderstorm rolled through the area. Heavy rain fell for
about 45 minutes, swelling Wegee Creek, one of two creeks that
overflowed in Thursday night's flash flood.
   By midmorning, the muddy creek was nearly crossing a road about
three miles upstream from where the floods inflicted the most
damage. Lt. Dean Irvin of the Ohio Army National Guard said there
were no immediate reports of additional property damage.
   The body found this morning was in the Ohio River near
Moundsville, W.Va., about 10 miles south of Shadyside, according to
Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator.
   The number of names on the list of missing dropped from 18 to 14
with the identities of three victims and a call by one person
alerting authorities that she was safe, Vogt said. One of the
recovered bodies remains unidentified. Authorities are not ruling
out the possibility that other people not on the list could be
missing.
   Four bodies were recovered Sunday.
   Officials said Friday that 60 people were missing; some of those
later were found dead, while others notified authorities that they
were safe and officials learned that still more had moved out of
the area.
   Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5{
inches of rain in 3{ hours. The floods destroyed as many as 70
houses and damaged up to 40 others.
   Most of those whose homes and belongings were swept away by the
wall of water will have to put their lives back together largely
without benefit of insurance.
   Few people in the coal-mining and steel-making area carried
flood insurance, and homeowners' insurance will not cover damage
from Thursday's flood, residents and insurers said.
   ``We didn't think we needed to have flood insurance. For what?
That creek never flooded. Then this. Everybody just got wiped
out,'' said Julia Kulazenka.
   Rainwater running down hillsides had forced debris into the
creeks and formed dams at bridges spanning them, Shadyside Fire
Chief Mark Badia said.
   ``Eventually the bridges couldn't hold any more. The debris
broke loose, and that's when we got three big gushes of water,''
Badia said.
   The home Mrs. Kulazenka shared with her husband until his death
last July was damaged as Wegee Creek raged out of control. She said
replacing a machine shop, garage, deck and automobiles she and her
son owned would cost more than $80,000.
   ``They told us homeowners' won't do us no good. So unless the
government helps us rebuild, I don't know what I'll do with this
place,'' Mrs. Kulazenka said.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it will open an
office Tuesday in Shadyside to accept applications from residents
for low-interest loans and grants to help them rebuild.
   Before the flood, land in the Wegee Creek valley fetched
handsome prices, said Kulazenka's son, Charles Kulazenka. That was
especially welcome to residents, many of whom were either retired
or laid off from jobs in coal mines in Belmont County, where
unemployment in April was 6.8 percent.
   ``Ground was at a premium down here before this because it was
just outside the city limits (of Shadyside). It was quiet and
peaceful and people were looking to buy and build new homes out
here. Now, you couldn't give it away,'' Kulazenka said.
   ``But we can't be bitter, though, because we've got our lives,
and a lot of our neighbors, real close buddies, weren't that
lucky.''
