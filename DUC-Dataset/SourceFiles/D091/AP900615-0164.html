    Water Wall Hits Ohio Town; 11 Dead, 51 Missing.
   </title>
   <text>
    Torrential thunderstorms sent a flash
flood surging through a valley into this Ohio River town, killing
at least 11 people, leaving 51 missing and scores of others
homeless Friday, authorities said.
   Raging floodwaters late Thursday swept homes off foundations and
washed away cars. About 200 people were reported evacuated in
central Ohio.
   ``The valleys are choked with debris,'' Gov. Richard Celeste
told reporters after flying over the hilly Appalachian region in
eastern Ohio. ``A wall of water wiped a path through the area.''
   The governor declared a state of emergency, and dispatched about
50 National Guardsmen to the area.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency declared Belmont County,
which includes Shadyside, and Jefferson and Franklin counties
disaster areas, making federal aid available to residents.
Seventeen counties now have been declared disaster areas because of
flooding or tornadoes since May 29.
   Ten bodies were taken to the Bauknecht Funeral Home in
Shadyside, said Bob Bell, funeral director. One body was taken to
Bellaire City Hospital, he said.
   Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroner's investigator, also said
there were 11 confirmed dead.
   Earlier, Fire Chief Mark Badia had said 14 adults and two
children were dead. The names of the victims have not been released.
   County Sheriff Tom McCort, who said he was running the recovery
effort, said 51 people in Shadysville and Meade Township, where the
two creeks run south of the village, were missing as of 8:45 p.m.
   The list was compiled through telephone inquiries with
townspeople and relatives and interviews with people evacuated from
the area.
   About 200 people came and went from a Shadyside disaster center
during the day, seeking news of missing friends and relatives.
   Vogt said two bodies were found in the Ohio River and one was
found in a field next to the river after water receded. He said the
rest were found in the creeks, which flow into the river.
   Some of the bodies were taken to a funeral home that set up a
temporary morgue in Shadyside, about 10 miles south of Wheeling,
W.Va.
   Officials from Ohio, West Virginia and the U.S. Coast Guard were
searching the Ohio River for survivors and bodies, and Badia said
National Guardsmen were to continue searching the creeks throughout
the night.
   At least five houses along Wegee Creek were washed away, and two
cars were floating in water in one of the basements. Anything that
was still standing was covered with at least 6 feet of debris such
as trees, appliances and furniture.
   The National Weather Service issued no flood warning before the
disaster, although it did issue a flood watch, said Al Wheeler,
deputy meteorologist in the bureau's Cleveland office.
   Weather service offices in Cleveland, Akron, Columbus and
Pittsburgh showed the storm had diminished over eastern Ohio when
it had actually intensified, Wheeler said.
   Thursday night's thunderstorms caused flash flooding across a
wide area of central and eastern Ohio, northern West Virginia and
western Pennsylvania. The floods closed roads, damaged homes and
forced hundreds of people to evacuate.
   But no place was hit with anything approaching the ferocity of
the flooding in Shadyside.
   About 5.5 inches of rain fell between 7:30 p.m. and 11 p.m.,
turning two Ohio River tributaries outside the village of 4,300
people into dangerous torrents.
   About 35 buildings, including a tavern, were damaged along Wegee
Creek, and 50 buildings were hit by a flood along Pipe Creek, four
miles south of Wegee Creek, said Dick Quinlin, Belmont County
emergency services coordinator.
   Part of the tavern was washed away when water caved in the back
wall, said Judy Phillips, a sheriff's department spokeswoman. She
said two patrons were accounted for, but she could offer no
estimate of how many were inside at the time.
   One man was found clinging to a bar stool, said state Sen.
Robert Ney, whose district includes Shadyside.
   ``I've never seen anything of this magnitude. There was no
warning,'' Ney said.
   Rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, which
flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River, said Badia.
   ``I don't know how to describe it. ... You've got to see it to
believe it,'' Badia said.
   One resident, Robert Ramsey, said his wife, Rose, was crushed to
death in their house by the water.
   There was no complete accounting of deaths, said Karen Bovek, a
spokeswoman at a Shadyside Fire Department command center set up an
a school.
   ``You're talking miles and miles of country roads that haven't
been gotten to yet,'' she said. ``It's a disaster here.''
   There also was flooding in Jefferson County, north of Belmont,
in Licking County in central Ohio, and in northwestern West
Virginia and western Pennsylvania.
   ``It's a pretty good mess, especially in the northern end of the
county,'' said Clarence Weston, a dispatcher with the Marshall
County Sheriff's Department in Moundsville, W.Va. ``We had 3.5
inches of rain in a two-hour period last night.''
   Most of the problems in West Virginia were confined to road
closures and basement flooding.
   At least 25 people were evacuated during the night in the
Pittsburgh suburb of Etna, where some homes had up to 5 feet of
water in their basements, said borough manager Bill Skertich. They
returned to their homes Friday.
   Landslides were reported in the Pittsburgh area, and many city
streets were closed during the storm.
   The flooding was more serious in Licking County, Ohio. Wayne
Tresemer, the county's Disaster Services director, said water was
standing up to 5 feet deep in some streets in the town of Newark,
and the fire department and other agencies used boats to evacuate
some residents.
   Two inches of rain caused flooding in Franklin County in central
Ohio and 3.75 inches of rain was dumped on Holmes County in
north-central Ohio, the National Weather Service said.
   In Jefferson County, just north of Belmont County in the eastern
part of the state, 50 to 60 residents were evacuated in Adena,
where water was 6 to 8 feet deep in streets because of creek
flooding.
   Flood waters in most areas had subsided by Thursday night,
according to authorities.
