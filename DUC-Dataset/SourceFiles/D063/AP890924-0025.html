    Prince Philip Condemns IRA, Clergy Urge Forgiveness.
   </title>
   <text>
    Prince Philip on Sunday condemned the
``senseless'' killing of 10 Royal Marines musicians in an IRA
bombing, and Britain's defense secretary said he warned all
military bases of the risk of similar attacks.
   Clergyman urged relatives and friends of dead and maimed
musicians to forgive the bombers. ``Only forgiveness breaks the tie
between the hater and the hated,'' the Rev. George Lings told
mourners.
   The prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth II and captain general of
the Royal Marines, visited injured men in the hospital and toured
the severely damaged Royal Marines School of Music in Deal,
southeast Britain.
   ``It will not help the IRA win anything,'' said Philip, who wore
a Royal Marines tie. ``It is senseless. One simply wonders what
sort of mentality can even contemplate such meaningless acts. It is
appalling.''
   He paid tribute to the 12 injured men, five of whom were
critically wounded.
   The prince was accompanied by Viscountess Mountbatten, daughter
of Lord Mountbatten, who was killed by an IRA bomb on his boat in
1979. Mountbatten was India's last viceroy and a cousin of the
queen.
   British military installations are a frequent target of the
Irish Republican Army in its campaign to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   Defense Secretary Tom King said Sunday he has issued an alert to
all military installations to prevent other attacks. He would not
give details.
   ``The perpetrators of the latest outrage are at large and there
is a risk of other attacks,'' King said. ``That is why we are
taking a number of other steps.''
   King defended the use of private security firms hired to guard
the Deal school and 29 other ``low-risk'' military installations in
Britain. Local residents and grieving relatives have said security
was lax and should be turned back to the marines. King said the
private firms will remain.
   ``It is important to remember that what we need in these cases
are eyes and ears and observation,'' King said on British
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   ``Private security guards can be a very useful additional
assistance. They also help to reduce the amount of time soldiers
have to spend on what is not the most enjoyable part of their
activity.''
   At church services throughout the small port, clergymen urged
mourners to pray for and forgive the bombers.
   The Rev. Charles Howard, a Royal Navy chaplain, asked the
300-member congregation inside the barracks, ``if you can find room
in your hearts ... pray for the men who perpetrated this terrible
act, that God will soften their hearts and turn them from their
violent and evil ways.''
   Many cried as Howard read aloud the names of the 10 servicemen
killed during a coffee break between band practices. It was the
worst IRA attack on the British mainland since July 1982.
   At nearby St. George's Church, formerly the Royal Marines'
church, Lings said, ``no one says forgiveness is easy; no one says
the terrorist deserves forgiveness.
   ``But ... forgive them, they not what they do.''
