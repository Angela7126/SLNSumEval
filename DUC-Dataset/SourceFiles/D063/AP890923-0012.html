    IRA Attack Stirs Security Controversy.

   <text>
    The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blew
apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons
and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school.
   A huge explosion in a barracks staff room Friday morning leveled
the three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee break between
practice sessions on the school's parade ground.
   Twelve of the 22 people injured were hospitalized, eight of them
in serious condition, police said. They said nine of the dead were
bandsmen and one other man was not immediately identified.
   Dozens of neighboring homes in the quiet southeastern English
seaside town of Deal were damaged.
   Although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20, Col.
John Ware, principal director of music, said the slain bandsmen all
were trained, adult musicians. They held military ranks but none had
been trained as a fighting soldier.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army, engaged in a 20-year-old
campaign to drive the British from the province of Northern Ireland,
claimed responsibility in a telephone call to Ireland International,
a Dublin news agency.
   Residents of the area adjoining the Marines school said Friday
that despite government calls for stepped-up public alertness
against terrorists, security at the school had eased noticeably.
   ``Anyone in Deal will tell you how easy it is to get into the
base,'' said Fred Verge, a 70-year-old army veteran.
   Local people laid wreaths and bouquets of flowers at the entrance
to the barracks.
   ``There is a great sense of anger'' in the community, Kent police
Chief Constable Paul Condon said.
   The Royal Marines Music School is one of 30 military
establishments in Britain that use private security firms, Defense
Ministry figures show.
   Unidentified defense sources quoted by the Times newspaper today
said the civilian guards were backed up by armed Marines who
patrolled regularly inside the perimeter.
   Defense Secretary Tom King promised a security review and said
new measures had already been taken at the base. He did not
elaborate.
   Martin O'Neill, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on
defense, said on Friday: ``Serious questions must be asked about the
penny-pinching policy of the Ministry of Defense, which may well put
our armed services at dreadful risk.''
   O'Neill later told British Broadcasting Corp. television the IRA
was ``prepared to take out anybody. The cowardly nature of their
attacks is such that every military establishment is under threat.''
   He said private security firms were assigned to areas considered
low risks for attacks.
   ``If we designate places as being low-risk categories, then it is
likely they will be attacked, given the way that the IRA is forced
to operate,'' O'Neill added.
   ``The big prizes are no longer available to them, so they're
picking off the ones which they regard ... vulnerable.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher received news of the bombing
while aboard a jet over Siberia en route from Japan to Moscow. She
called it a ``deeply serious outrage.''
   King visited the scene soon after the explosion.
   ``I know that the people who committed it, the godfathers who
sent them, actually know in their hearts that it is not going to
make any difference; that it is just killing for the sake of
killing,'' he said.
   The defense minister, anger clearly written on his face, said
that rather than erode the will of the security forces, the attack
``redoubles their determination to ensure that terrorism cannot
win.''
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland condemned the attack
and sent Mrs. Thatcher a message of sympathy at ``this outrage ...
which has caused severe and tragic loss of life and many injuries.''
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA claim gave no details of the
operation, but said it was a response to a ``message of war''
delivered by Mrs. Thatcher when she visited Northern Ireland nine
days ago.
   It was an apparent reference to her speech praising the locally
recruited Ulster Defense Regiment as ``a very, very brave group of
men'' who have lost 179 members in IRA attacks since 1970.
   The mainly Protestant UDR is regarded by many Catholics as a
sectarian force, and is at present under a cloud over allegations
that some recruits leaked names, addresses and photos of IRA
suspects to Protestant assassins.
   British military installations are a frequent target of the IRA
campaign. Friday's attack was the worst since July 1982 when 11
servicemen were fatally wounded in two bombings in central London.
   The music school trains young recruits for the seven Royal
Marines bands. Up to 250 young men, most ages 16 to 20, undergo
military and musical training there, working with older,
professional bandsmen.
