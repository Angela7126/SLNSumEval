    President Mikhail Gorbachev today furiously denounced the "crude and crafty"
plotters who briefly overthrew him but said the failed power grab by
hard-liners could prove to be an "enormous opportunity" to further his
democratic reforms.;   Gorbachev, moving to tighten his newly regained grip on
power and punish the coup leaders, declared at a news conference that the
Soviet Union had survived "the most difficult trial" of his six-year-old
reform movement.

    At the news conference -- Gorbachev's first since the coup against him
collapsed on Wednesday -- the 60-year-old leader condemned the takeover as
being against "the people, against democracy.";   Earlier, he told reporters
he would have killed himself rather than submit to any forced arrangement with
the coup leaders. "I said I wouldn't make any deals," he said then.
"Otherwise, I would have had to commit suicide.";   Gorbachev detailed his
purge of coup leaders, including Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov. He named a new
acting KGB chief, interior minister and defense minister, and said he would do
everything to "drive out the reactionary forces from the Communist Party.";  
Gorbachev pledged cooperation with Russian republic President Boris Yeltsin
but said he had no plans to leave the Communist Party.;   "I am convinced that
socialism is correct. I am an adherent of socialism.";   When asked if Yeltsin
now had more power than he did, Gorbachev said, "We have been bound together
by the situation.";   Looking and sounding angry, he described the plotters as
"primitive and crude and crafty" and scoffed at their announcement that he had
stepped aside because he was ill. "Their hands were shaking the whole time,"
he said derisively.;   Despite his display of anger, the Soviet president said
the failure of the coup could ultimately help ensure the continuation of his
reforms. "We have to see this as an enormous opportunity," he said.;   At his
news conference, Gorbachev made a point of publicly praising Yeltsin, whose
folk-hero stature was enhanced during the coup as he rallied hundreds of
thousands of his supporters to resist.;   Before dawn today, Gorbachev flew
back to Moscow from the Crimea, where he had been confined to his summer home
during his brief ouster.;   The Soviet president, who was reported to have
slept for a few hours in his dacha outside Moscow after returning from the
Crimea, arrived at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport unannounced, under heavy security.
He looked somewhat disheveled, clad in a windbreaker and a shirt with open
collar.;   Appearing on Soviet television after his arrival, Gorbachev looked
haggard and unshaven, with deep lines around his eyes and mouth. Later, at his
news conference, he at first spoke haltingly, but then appeared to recover his
composure and spoke in a forceful voice.;   Gorbachev said his captors cut off
all communication and that his only source of news during the coup had been
from foreign broadcasts, including the BBC and Voice of America, received on a
makeshift radio set up by his personal guards.;   "This has been a very
difficult, an extremely difficult lesson for me. It's my, you might say, my
drama," he told reporters.;   "Everything was done to weaken me
psychologically," Gorbachev said. "It was hard. It is hard to say it now, but
that's how it was.";   He said that early on in the coup, he tried to find out
who was behind it.;   "I picked up one of the telephones I have and it wasn't
working. I picked up a second, a third, a fourth ... everything was cut
off," he said.;   "Every day, morning and night, I demanded ... that my
communication be restored and that an airplane be brought immediately so I
could be returned to Moscow," he said. He was being held at his vacation home
in the Crimea.;   Gorbachev said the coup leaders demanded that he resign.;  
"I said, 'You will never live that long (to see me resign).' ";   He called
the crisis "one of the most difficult trials of the entire history" of his
six-year rule.;   Gorbachev said his 32-man personal guard stayed with him
throughout the coup.;   The 60-year-old president said the crisis had been
difficult for his family, especially his wife, Raisa, who "took it very
hard.";   "Best of all, my granddaughter Anastasia didn't understand anything
that was going on," Gorbachev told reporters. "She wanted to go to the beach;
that's all that concerned her. But the guards wouldn't let her go to the
beach; they were concerned something would happen.";   When it became clear
the coup was failing, Gorbachev said he prepared himself and his family for
the possibility that they would be killed by the conspirators.;   "You know
that it appeared as though they might have done something to me. They might
have killed me and my whole family and made it look as if ... they were
acting in the name" of the acting president.;   "These people might have done
almost anything," he said.
