    Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin launched a sweeping purge today that dealt
a series of stunning blows to the Communist Party power structure, including
the ouster of top officials, the sealing of party headquarters and the
curtailing of party activities.;   Yeltsin appeared today to be acting at
least as an equal with Gorbachev, and the two clearly agreed on the
replacement of old-guard officials by new reformers. In fact, the two leaders
reached an agreement that permits each man to assume the other's duties in an
emergency, such as another coup attempt.

    Gorbachev threw out his foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, and his
acting defense minister, and named a new head of the KGB. And Yeltsin, with
Gorbachev's blessing, fired the heads of state-owned media.;   The Moscow City
Council, meanwhile, ordered all Communist Party buildings in the capital
sealed and all telephone service to party and KGB buildings cut. About 2,000
protesters blockaded the Communist Party headquarters in Moscow, declaring
they were trying to prevent the removal of documents that might contain
evidence linking party members to the coup. Some of the demonstrators chanted,
"Down with the Communist Party!";   Yeltsin, who had led the nationwide
resistance to the coup, announced a ban on Communist Party activities in the
Russian republic, the army, police units of the Interior Ministry and the KGB,
which for decades helped enforce Communist rule. Some of the many new decrees
issued by Yeltsin went beyond the official bounds of his power as Russian
Federation president.;   In his speech before the Russian parliament,
Gorbachev was compelled to affirm as legitimate the decrees issued by Yeltsin
during the three-day coup. It wasn't clear whether the Soviet president had
intended to back Yeltsin's latest decrees, and he balked at proposals by
Russian deputies to outlaw the Communist Party, saying it would divide the
nation.;   Gorbachev told the deputies that the government would prosecute
those responsible for the takeover. "They wanted to turn us into meat. They
wanted to annihilate us, and for that they must bear the severe
responsibility," the Soviet president said.;   He accused the Communist Party
Central Committee of panicking during the coup. "There are people who lost
their heads, all sense of responsibility. You could even call them traitors!
Traitors!";   At one point during the session, Gorbachev dramatically held up
what he said were the minutes of a secret Cabinet meeting during the coup that
revealed who backed the emergency decrees. He said many of them "hemmed and
hawed," but most voted in support of the takeover.;   Today's meeting
displayed unprecedented openness in which deputies repeatedly interrupted
Gorbachev and argued with him.;   Gorbachev drew applause from deputies when
he announced that the party's headquarters in Moscow was sealed.;   The
meeting of Gorbachev and Yeltsin was the first since the coup collapsed to
discuss the takeover and to deal with officials who backed the putsch.;   In
his speech, Gorbachev praised "the outstanding role" of Yeltsin, his sometimes
adversary, in halting the hard-line Communist coup. Yeltsin has been a strong
foe of Communist Party influence in the country; Gorbachev, however, warned in
his speech against "any kind of anti-Communist hysteria.";   Yeltsin often
commented during Gorbachev's speech, and Gorbachev deferred to him several
times on details of what happened during Gorbachev's detention.;    Standing
ovation;   The Soviet president's opening comments drew a standing ovation
from the lawmakers in the parliament. Yeltsin led the opposition to the coup
from the parliament building, where supporters rallied to build barricades and
form a human shield against expected attacks. The coup plotters never dared
mount a frontal assault on Yeltsin's headquarters during the standoff.;   As
the face of the Soviet government continued to change in the aftermath of the
failed coup, hundreds of angry residents marched toward Communist Party
headquarters in Moscow intent on proving the party was behind the coup.;   In
other developments:;   (check) Only one of the eight top leaders of the coup
remained at large early today -- Oleg Baklanov, deputy of the state Defense
Committee.;   (check) In Kirghizia, Kirghiz President Askar Akaev said the
republic would take control of the headquarters of the Kirghiz wing of the
Communist Party, as well as the local Lenin Museum. Akaev said the party would
be compensated.;   Publication suspended; In Moscow, Yeltsin today
nationalized the hundreds of printing plants in the Russian republic.;   He
suspended the publication of six Communist Party newspapers and ordered new
chiefs for the official Novosti and Tass news services, charging they had
supported the takeover.;   The actions by Yeltsin, who quit the party last
summer, came amid a growing wave of anger at the Communist Party, six of whose
top party officials were arrested for instigating the coup.;   In a major blow
to the crumbling party, the acting head of the KGB today affirmed Yeltsin's
ban on Communist Party activity in the security service, Tass said. A KGB
directive also banned any other political parties in the KGB, for decades used
by Communist regimes to intimidate dissidents and anti-Communist activists.;  
 Bold protests; The firing of Bessmertnykh followed criticism of his silence
during the coup. Bessmertnykh, 57, was the latest official to step down or be
removed after the failed takeover. He was not seen publicly after the coup
began, and he didn't re-emerge until the coup leadership began to collapse.
Bessmertnykh said he had been ill and unable to act.;   The arrest of the
former KGB chief and other Communist Party hard-liners inspired tens of
thousands of demonstrators to undreamed-of daring Thursday.;   They expressed
their anger and disgust with the organizations responsible for killing
millions of Soviet citizens and now caught conspiring to return to their old
dictatorship.;   At KGB headquarters on Dzerzhinsky Street, thousands shook
fists and shouted, "Executioners!" They smeared "Down with the KGB!" and a
swastika on the front of the building in white paint.
