    WAS GORBACHEV THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THE COUP?
   </title>
   <leadpara>
    IT IS the stuff of a Byzantine Cold War novel, enticing enough to grab the
attention of even the most benign conspiracy theorist: Did Mikhail Gorbachev
orchestrate the coup that almost overthrew him?;   The blueprint for imposing
a state of emergency was drawn by Gorbachev himself last winter. He pushed
through the legislation that included suspension of political activity and of
freedom of the press. He hand-picked the heads of the coercive institutions
and other key officials who took part in the coup.

    Gorbachev chose to ignore warnings about the right's impending attempt to
seize power. Some warnings came from Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such as
Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup. But, incredibly, the clearest
signals came from the hard-liners themselves.;   A leading conservative
journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known as the "nightingale of the General
Staff," published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the
General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and
Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov. With remarkable
candor, Baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to
avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union.
Needless to say, Baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the Gang of
Eight.;   Gorbachev ignored these warnings.;   To some -- an admitted minority
-- the thought of a Gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably within the range of
the traditional Soviet art of deception known as maskirovka. And to laymen,
something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean
anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power.;   The most volatile
fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from Gorbachev himself, in his
Thursday news conference in which he described his three days under house
arrest in the Crimea.;   Among the questions: If Gorbachev's 32 armed guards
remained loyal to him throughout, why was there no conflict with the
opposition delegation that notified the president of the coup? Why didn't the
coup leaders incapacitate Gorbachev's guards, or at least separate them from
him?;   If Gorbachev's contact with the outside world was limited to
intercepting Western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio, how was he
able to describe the news conference given by the collaborators, down to his
view of their trembling hands?;   It is highly unlikely that the hard-liners
had been set up or ordered by Gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in
order to improve his political standing. Such a scenario would require an
unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to Gorbachev on their part.;   A
more plausible scenario is that Gorbachev was initially a full member of the
conspiracy, which, with his participation, could have clung to the fig leaf of
constitutionality and would have thwarted the new Union Treaty, to have been
signed last Tuesday, which provided for transfer of key levers of power from
the federal presidency to the leaders of republics.;   It is possible that,
unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the
start of the coup, Gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the
initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer
residence.;   Gorbachev did reveal, however, that two important officials had
visited him in Crimea at the outset of the coup. One was head of the KGB
department responsible for the security of Soviet leaders; the other was V.
Boldin, Gorbachev's closest aide, by the president's own admission a man of
absolute loyalty to him. One can't help but wonder whether these two visitors
came to deliver an ultimatum to Gorbachev and put him under arrest in the
event of his non-compliance, or to deliver important documents from fellow
junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise.;   Conspiracy theorists
grope for motives -- Gorbachev wanted to ferret out disloyal elements in his
government, to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a
treaty that would have lessened his powers. But there is virtually unanimous
agreement on one point. Gorbachev put into power the very hard-liners who
fronted the coup and kept them in power despite their vocal mutterings about
him.
