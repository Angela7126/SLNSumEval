    Nothing so important has happened in Soviet politics since 1917, when the
Bolsheviks seized power. In Moscow on Wednesday, the system the Bolsheviks and
Joseph Stalin created finally collapsed. A new historical epoch began.;  
Soviets had an experience comparable to those that transformed the outlooks of
Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and Slovaks in 1989, when they learned they could
finally be free. Soviets' courage in resisting this putsch announced the
arrival of a nation capable of self-governance.

    The "coup people," as President Bush dubbed them, could not have
miscalculated more profoundly. They thought the issue was Mikhail Gorbachev,
and apparently believed that by neutralizing Gorbachev and threatening
everyone else, they could quickly take charge of the country.;   But the
people of the Soviet Union apparently concluded that the real issue was not
Gorbachev himself, but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy
that his reforms had created. For the first time in their thousand-year
history, Russians asserted their independence from autocracy, and the
autocrats fell.;   There will be much to sort out in the months ahead. But
almost certainly the failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the
democratic revolution it tried to choke. That revolution will alter the
country, creating a new, decentralized and probably smaller Soviet Union much
more quickly than anyone anticipated.;   Gorbachev's own standing also will be
transformed by these events. It seems unlikely that he can escape the
consequences of his own past miscalculations -- especially the miscalculation
that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule.
Gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late
20th century, but this week he was trumped by Boris Yeltsin, who will now
rightly be seen as the man who saved him.;   Yeltsin had two talents that
Gorbachev lacked. One was the ability to stay close to the Russian people as
their world was transformed by Gorbachev's revolution -- hence his thumping
victory in this spring's first presidential election in Russia and Gorbachev's
abysmal standing in the polls. Yeltsin's second talent was his eagerness to
challenge the apparatus of the Soviet Communist Party, the world from which
both he and Gorbachev emerged.;   Gorbachev could never shuck his party
apparatchik's skin. Instead of reaching out to new ideas and new people as
Yeltsin has, he surrounded himself with traditional Communist Party officials
and worried about the impact of new schemes and ideas. Gorbachev thought
Vladimir Kryuchkov of the KGB, Boris Pugo of the Ministry of Interior, Dmitri
Yazov of the Red Army and Gennady Yanayev of the Communist Party were
necessary bedfellows whose presence in his entourage could protect him from
conservative forces that hated his reforms. Instead, they turned out to be
mortal enemies.;   If they had been only personal enemies, Gorbachev might
have been undone by them. But when they closed the new, liberal news media and
reverted to the Stalinist tradition of the big lie, the members of the State
Emergency Committee threatened not just Gorbachev but also the new Soviet
Union -- a society that offered its citizens an unprecedented opportunity for
dignity, self-reliance and freedom. For years, Soviets and Western
Kremlinologists had debated whether the changes that created this new Soviet
Union were irreversible. Tuesday, it became clear that they were.;   Of
course, Gorbachev initiated those changes, and history will credit him for
that. He also refused to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those
responsible for the coup apparently asked him to endorse last weekend.;   It
is intriguing in assessing the coup's failure that men trained as thugs by
some of the most violent and mean-spirited institutions created by any state
could not, in their moment of truth, behave like thugs and kill their
compatriots. They left Gorbachev alive and Yeltsin at large; they let the
Western media report their coup as it unfolded; and they allowed foreign radio
stations to broadcast news of it back into the country. Even their own news
media, under strict control, conveyed the fact that there was widespread
resistance to their attempted coup.;   By Tuesday night, the Emergency
Committee was in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of Yeltsin, and
this proved an unequal contest. As Gorbachev had previously discovered in his
negotiations with Yeltsin over a new union treaty, the legitimacy provided by
the 50 million votes that Yeltsin received in the elections for president of
the Russian federation was a formidable political force.;   At first blush,
the botching of the coup was surprising -- couldn't the vaunted KGB and its
allies run an efficient putsch? But these were representatives of the
political class that turned one of the world's richest nations into a basket
case. Perhaps their coup should be seen as a desperate and forlorn effort to
deny a truth that proved undeniable -- that the Stalinist system had failed so
utterly there was simply no way to redeem it.
