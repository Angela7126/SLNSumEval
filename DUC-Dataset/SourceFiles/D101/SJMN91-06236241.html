    Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin today pressed ahead with a sweeping purge
of coup supporters, and the Communist Party suffered a series of stunning
blows for not opposing the coup plotters.;   Gorbachev threw out his foreign
minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, and the Communist Party was banned from the
KGB, which for decades helped enforce Communist rule.

    Gorbachev told an audience at the Russian parliament that the government
would prosecute those responsible for the takeover. "They wanted to turn us
into meat. They wanted to annihilate us, and for that they must bear the
severe responsibility," the Soviet president said.;   He accused the Communist
Party Central Committee of panicking during the coup. "There are people who
lost their heads, all sense of responsibility. You could even call them
traitors! Traitors!";   Gorbachev and Yeltsin, the Russian Federation leader
who saved Gorbachev, met today for the first time since the coup collapsed to
discuss the takeover and deal with officials who backed the putsch. Gorbachev
named a series of well-known reformers to the posts of those who were fired.; 
 In his speech, Gorbachev praised "the outstanding role" of Yeltsin, his
sometimes adversary, in halting the hard-line Communist coup. Yeltsin has been
a strong foe of Communist Party influence in the country; Gorbachev, however,
warned in his speech against "any kind of anti-Communist hysteria.";   Yeltsin
commented frequently during Gorbachev's speech, and Gorbachev deferred to him
several times on details of what happened while Gorbachev was in detention.;  
His opening comments drew a standing ovation from the lawmakers in the
parliament, where Yeltsin had led the opposition to the coup.;   Gorbachev
also told the Russian Federation parliamentarians that the leaders of the
hard-line coup had sought to arrest Yeltsin. "The president of Russia, Yeltsin
. . . was to be arrested, that is how I understood it," Gorbachev said, adding
the coup plotters intended to isolate Yeltsin.;   As the face of the Soviet
government continued to change in the aftermath of the 63-hour coup, hundreds
of angry citizens marched toward Communist Party headquarters in Moscow intent
on proving the party was behind the coup.;   Yeltsin, who led the nationwide
coup resistance, today nationalized the hundreds of printing plants in the
Russian republic.;   He suspended the publication of six Communist Party
newspapers and ordered new chiefs for the official Novosti and Tass news
services, charging that they had supported the takeover. It was unclear
whether he had the authority to order the firings.;   The actions by Yeltsin,
who quit the party last summer, came amid a growing wave of anger at the
Communist Party, six of whose top party officials were arrested for
instigating the coup.;   In a major blow to the crumbling party, the acting
head of the KGB today banned Communist Party activity in the security service,
Tass said. A KGB directive also banned any other political parties in the KGB,
for decades used by Communist regimes to intimidate dissidents and
anti-Communist activists.;   As Gorbachev and Yeltsin met, a crowd of about
1,000 people headed toward the Communist Party headquarters in Moscow, saying
they wanted to capture and preserve records that might prove the party
supported the coup.;   Calls for retribution have sounded since the 3-day-old
coup collapsed Wednesday, with Gorbachev beginning a purge of coup plotters
and thousands of cheering demonstrators toppling a statue outside the Moscow
headquarters of the KGB, whose former leader backed the ouster attempt.;  
Bessmertnykh is out;   The firing of Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh followed
criticism of his silence during the coup. Bessmertnykh, 57, was the latest
official to step down or be removed after the failed takeover.;   In in his
speech to the Russian Federation parliament, Gorbachev said of Bessmertnykh
"this morning I got information that at least he was trying to maneuver or
worse" during the coup attempt.;   He was not seen publicly after the coup
began, and he didn't re-emerge until the coup leadership began to collapse.
Bessmertnykh said he had been ill and unable to act.;   Also dismissed was
Soviet parliamentary speaker Anatoly Lukyanov, whom Yeltsin had named as the
chief ideologue of the plotters.;   Yeltsin, who stature rose with his
resistance in the coup, said earlier that he would insist that proven
reformers be installed in top jobs.;   Gorbachev told the legislators that he
did not want now to name all those appointed to replace the hard-liners, but
Yeltsin said that Gorbachev had agreed to appointing Maj. Gen. Constantine
Kovets head of the army. Kovets was in charge of defense for the Russian
republic.;   Six newspapers suspended; The six newspapers suspended by
Yeltsin, all based in the Russian republic, are Pravda, Sovietskaya Rossiya,
Glasnost, Rabochaya Tribuna, Moskovskaya Pravda and Leninskoe Znamya. It was
unclear whether he had the authority to fire the chiefs at Tass and Novosti.
He also ordered Novosti nationalized.;   In other developments:;   (check)
Gorbachev said he would meet today with leaders of the nine republics who
support the new Union Treaty. The treaty, whose signing was put off by the
coup, had angered hard-liners who objected to its provisions ceding more
Kremlin power to the republics. Gorbachev also was to make a late-afternoon
visit to the Russian parliament, Tass reported.;   (check) Kirghiz President
Askar Akaev said the republic of Kirghizia would take control of the
headquarters of the Kirghiz wing of the Communist Party and the local Lenin
Museum. Akaev said the party would be compensated.;   (check) Only one of the
eight top leaders of the coup remained at large early today -- Oleg Baklanov,
deputy of the state Defense Committee.;   Coup leader kills himself; One of
the coup leaders, Interior Minister Boris Pugo, committed suicide Thursday by
shooting himself in the head as he was about to be arrested, officials said.
He was replaced by Lt. Gen. Vasily P. Trushin.;   Defense Minister Dmitri
Yazov was arrested and replaced by Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the chief of the
Soviet general staff. Leonid V. Shebarshin was named to replace KGB Chief
Vladimir Kryuchkov.;   Gorbachev's chief of staff, Valery I. Boldin, was
replaced by Grigory Revenko.
