    Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was said to be back in power today and
returning to Moscow as the coup against him collapsed and its leaders
reportedly fled. Tanks deployed after the takeover were leaving the capital.; 
 Outside the Russian parliament, which served as the headquarters for
resistance to the coup led by Boris Yeltsin, rejoicing crowds cheered and
waved flags as the three-day-old coup ended. Soldiers, their tanks covered
with flowers, waved at television cameras.

    In the United States, President Bush said he spoke to Gorbachev and the
Soviet leader was "calling the shots" again. Bush said the hard-line coup
leaders had "underestimated the power of the people, underestimated what a
taste of freedom and democracy brings.";   The coup, one of the most
tumultuous developments in recent Soviet history, unraveled in a series of
swift and dramatic developments today:;   (check) Tanks and armored personnel
carriers moved away from the Russian parliament, scene of the worst violence
of the coup. A 2 1/2-mile-long column of tanks and trucks headed out of
Moscow.;   (check) The leaders of the national legislature demanded
Gorbachev's reinstatement. The full legislature nullified the coup leaders'
emergency decrees.;   (check) Press restrictions were lifted. "I'm sorry,
comrades, but I'm very excited!" said a Soviet TV announcer, grinning broadly
after he was allowed for the first time to criticize the coup leaders'
actions.;   (check) The Communist Party, apparently seeking to salvage its own
image, denounced the takeover.;   (check) In the independence-minded Baltic
republics, which had borne the brunt of the post-coup crackdown, some Soviet
troops began returning to their permanent bases. Latvia joined neighbor
Estonia today in declaring immediate independence from the Soviet Union.;  
The coup's failure could deal a fatal blow to organized, high-level efforts to
thwart reform drives in the Soviet Union by Gorbachev and Yeltsin and
significantly alter the balance of power that has characterized Soviet power
for the six-year Gorbachev era.;   The country's future course depends,
however, on who remains in power. Although Yeltsin supported Gorbachev during
the coup, the two men maintain different approaches to Soviet reforms.;  
Gorbachev's foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, who had dropped out of
sight during the coup, reappeared today and called the takeover a page in
Soviet history that "has got to be turned.";   At a news conference,
Bessmertnykh promised that reforms would continue and that Moscow would honor
its international commitments.;   The national legislature invalidated all
decrees made by the coup leaders, national lawmaker Yuri Karyakin told the
Russian legislature. He gave no details about the vote. Karyakin said the
legislature's executive council demanded Gorbachev's return to power.;   Word
of Gorbachev's imminent return to the capital came from Lev Y. Sukhanov, a
long-time Yeltsin deputy. He said Gorbachev would fly from his vacation
retreat in the Crimea to the Soviet capital with Vladimir Ivashko, the deputy
general-secretary of the Communist Party and other aides.;   With the coup's
demise, the Communist Party moved to salvage its own credibility. It called
the takeover unconstitutional and demanded a meeting with Gorbachev, the party
chief, the official news agency Tass said. The party renounced any connection
with the coup leaders.;   Thousands of people had kept up their vigil at the
Russian parliament building after overnight clashes with Soviet troops that
left at least four dead. They roared with approval when the announcement of
the coup committee's departure came over a loudspeaker.;   The plane
reportedly carrying the coup leaders was said to be headed to the city of
Bishkek, formerly called Frunze, the capital of Kirgizia, 2,100 miles
southeast of Moscow, according to Radio Russia, which speaks for Yeltsin. It
was not immediately known why the coup leaders would travel to Kirgizia.;  
The radio said officials of the Russian republic would try to intercept the
plane and have its passengers arrested.;   But sources at the airport told the
Associated Press that only KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov was on a plane, and it
was headed to the Crimea, where Gorbachev reportedly had been placed under
house arrest. He reportedly was accompanied by Communist Party No. 2 leader
Vladimir Ivashko.;   The republic-run Russian Information Agency said Vice
President Gennady Yanayev, the nominal head of the coup committee, was still
in his Kremlin office. The report could not be independently confirmed, and
the discrepancies could not be clarified.;   Bush, in Maine, told a news
conference that Yeltsin told him in a telephone call that he believed that
five of the coup leaders left Moscow and that one of them, Prime Minister
Valentin Pavlov, was in the hospital.;   Despite the force brought to bear by
the coup leaders, they were unable to dislodge Yeltsin from the Russian
parliament, where he rallied the opposition, to enforce the curfew, or prevent
large demonstrations nationwide.;   The state of emergency was declared after
hard-line elements in the military and Communist Party ousted Gorbachev,
declaring he was ill. Few believed it.;   The junta had seemed unable to cope
with tens of thousands of people who erected barricades around Yeltsin's
stronghold in the parliament.;   There were also huge anti-coup demonstrations
in Moscow, Leningrad, Kishiniev and other cities, as well as strikes by coal
miners in Siberia.;   Early today, before the coup fell apart, columns of
tanks and armored personnel carriers had moved around central Moscow. One
patrol of the armored vehicles was trapped by furious demonstrators just after
midnight as it tried to break through a barricade.;   Two people were
confirmed shot or crushed to death as the vehicles tried to fight their way
through, and witnesses said a third person was killed. A Russian republic
official, Col. Viktor Samailov, told the independent news agency Interfax that
four people were shot or crushed to death in the clash.
