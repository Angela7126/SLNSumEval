    KUWAIT: in Kuwait.

    The British Embassy was hit by shellfire and the Sheraton and
Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele, sources said.
   Swiss charge d'affaires Franco Bessoni said on French radio that
the palace was taken after bombardment by Iraqi MiG jet fighters.
   ``You can see black smoke over there .... No one dares to go
out. You can hear gunfire. The entire foreign community is staying
indoors,'' he said.
   ``It's chaos, military jets are flying over all the time, Kathy
McGregor, a Canadian, said by telephone at about midday. She said
she could still hear artillery fire.
   The air space over Kuwait was closed, with airliners turned
away. Iraq also sealed its own borders and airspace.
   Iraq said in a statement that it had ``responded to the request
from interim government of free Kuwait and decided to cooperate
with it.''
   It said its troops _ no numbers were given _ were in Kuwait to
defend the revolution and the Kuwaiti people. There was no further
identification of the revolutionary government.
   Saddam's ruling council also warned that any foreign troops
trying to interfere with its actions would be attacked.
   Kuwaiti forces had engaged the Iraqi invaders with heavy
artillery in their failed attempt to repulse them, Kuwaiti
officials said earlier.
   The invaders were led by the elite Republican Guard that did the
brunt of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran. Iraq has an
estimated 1 million troops _ including reservists _ among its 16
million people, compared to 20,300 troops in Kuwait.
   Iraqi radio said 15 army divisions were being recalled and
ordered all men born between 1960 and 1966 to report to the army
within three days.
   Today's fighting quickly sent oil prices surging in
international markets. The price of North Sea Brent crude for
September delivery was quoted early today at $22.30 a barrel
against Wednesday's London close of $20.40.
   Iraq, the world's second-largest oil producer, had demanded
higher oil prices at last month's OPEC oil cartel meeting in Geneva.
   Saddam had threatened military action against Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates for exceeding their cartel production quotas
and driving crude prices down. OPEC agreed to cut output to boost
prices.
   The invasion came a day after talks between Kuwait and Iraq
collapsed in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. Kuwait had apparently refused to
bend to Iraqi demands.
   The crisis began July 17 when Saddam accused Kuwait of trying to
wreck the debt-ridden Iraqi economy with oil overproduction and
began massing troops on Kuwait's border. He also accused Kuwait of
stealing $2.4 billion in oil drilled from the border oil field,
Rumailah.
   Iraq also demanded the Kuwaiti island of Bubiyan, which is
opposite Iraq's only outlets to the Persian Gulf.
   Iraq, which reportedly massed about 100,000 troops at the border
on Wednesday, has been engaged in a major defense buildup since
Saddam came to power in 1979.
   But the Iran-Iraq war left it with a foreign debt of about $70
billion. Iraq borrowed $10 billion to $20 billion from Kuwait wants
that debt forgiven.
   In Kuwait early today, the rattle of automatic guns sounded and
explosions in rapid succession shook residents from their sleep and
the Kuwaiti Cabinet quickly assembled.
   The Cabinet was holed up at the headquarters of the Supreme
Defense Council with telephone and telex links cut off, said
official sources.
   Kuwaiti radio briefly stopped broadcasting, then went back on
the air on a different wavelength. A speaker believed to be Crown
Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah appealed
for Arab support.
   ``Oh Arabs, Kuwait's blood and honor is being violated, rush to
its rescue ... the children, the women, the old men of Kuwait are
calling on you,'' the speaker said.
   Kuwait, nearly the size of New Jersey, is a former British
protectorate that gained independence in 1961. Its residents are
among the wealthiest in the world because of the country's vast oil
reserves.
