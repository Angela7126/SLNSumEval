    Republicans Quickly Elevate Quayle Into The American Pantheon.
   </title>
   <text>
    Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated for
vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to Thomas
Jefferson and John F. Kennedy.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who served with Quayle on a Senate
subcommittee, told an audience that whenever he heard the Indiana
senator speak, ``I'd say, `there stands the next Thomas
Jefferson.'''
   And, added Warner, ``he does have the same fire in his belly as
our great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.''
   Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy, a
Democrat.
   ``In 1960, the American people voted for John F. Kennedy for
president and he was the relatively same age as Dan Quayle,'' said
Ford. ``John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 years
before he was elected president and Dan Quayle's had 12 years.''
   What Quayle thinks of those references isn't known. But he
doesn't like it when people say he looks like movie idol Robert
Redford.
   Whether, indeed, he looks like Redford seems to be in the eye of
the beholder. In the parlance of politics, it's an issue. They are
both male. They are both blond.
   The so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the
1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage. The actor, who once
played the role of a presidential office seeker in ``The
Candidate'' sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop the
look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature.
   Quayle said the news media had made the comparison, not he, and
after he was elected sent Redford an autographed picture of himself.
   And this week, he told reporters he considered the so-called
Redford look ``a stigma.'' He wasn't asked how he felt about being
painted as another Jefferson or Kennedy.
   Meanwhile, fellow senators were trying to publicize Quayle who,
at 41, hasn't had a chance to become a legend. He is a Republican
vice presidential candidate who is not, as Spiro Agnew once said of
himself, a household word.
   To help him get known, eight fellow senators Wednesday took
turns telling reporters how much they liked him.
   ``We know him well,'' said Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   ``He's attractive because of his looks, he's attractive because
of his enthusiasm,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
   ``I think Dan Quayle, although he's 41 years of age, he's going
to send a message to the American people that the Republican Party
respects young people who achieve,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
   Oh, yes, he's also rich, but the senators said that should not
hold him back.
   ``Let's not start this business of who's wealthy,'' Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y.
