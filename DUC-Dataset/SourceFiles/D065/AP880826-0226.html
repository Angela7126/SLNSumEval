    Quayle's Biography Inflates State Job; Quayle Concedes Error.
   </title>

    Republican vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle's official resume says he was the Indiana Consumer
Protection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit was
created, state records show.
   The law creating the unit passed April 14, 1971, and took effect
July 1. Officials said Quayle served as chief investigator from
July until mid-September, when he became administrative assistant
to then-Gov. Edgar D. Whitcomb.
   Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign is using as his
official background, says he was chief investigator of the unit in
the Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971.
   ``He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971,'' said
Robert Smith, the unit's first director and now an attorney in
Indianapolis.
   ``He was in fact the chief investigator. He helped get the unit
set up. (But) it would not have been before 1971,'' Smith said
Friday in a telephone interview. ``We formally began operations
July 1.''
   Quayle conceded Friday that the resume entry was ``inaccurate''
and said his staff had written the document.
   ``If it indicated that, that is inaccurate. I didn't hold that
job for two years,'' Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign
plane.
   Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called the
revelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland ``a cheap
shot.''
   Quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the
state Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from six
months of basic and advanced training for the Indiana National
Guard.
   Quayle, a 1969 graduate of DePauw University, was attending
Indiana University Law School at the time.
   M. Stanton Evans, then an editor with the Indianapolis News,
helped arrange his job interview with the state. Evans worked for
Eugene C. Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather and publisher of the News.
   ``At no point in any of this did Dan Quayle ask any favors or
use any influence,'' said Evans, now with the National Journalism
Center in Washington, D.C.
   ``He wouldn't have been hired as a chief investigator. He was
hired in an entry-level job and was promoted to a whole bunch of
jobs on his merits. It's a nothing story,'' Evans said.
   Theodore Sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently had
surgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, Timothy
Sendak.
   Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who was then an
assistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to the
establishment of the Consumer Protection Division, ``all complaints
and inquiries were handled by me. The legal assistant assigned to
me and utilized as my chief investigator was Dan Quayle.'' Her
statement was released by the Quayle campaign.
   The Consumer Protection Division was created by the state
legislature to resolve complaints over defective products, false
claims in ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud.
   In 1980, Quayle referred to himself as a ``Vietnam-era veteran''
in campaign literature when he was running against three-term
incumbent Birch Bayh in a Senate race.
   Quayle, who enlisted in the Indiana National Guard, dropped the
reference after objections by some Vietnam combat veterans.
   In that same election, which he won, Quayle said he was ``on
active duty for several periods during his tenure'' in the Guard.
The statement referred to periods when Quayle was in basic training
and 15 days of camp each summer.
