    Quayle's Triumph Quickly Tarnished.
   </title>
   <text>
    Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination was
supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator,
but the dream faded overnight.
   Bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to
ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of
inspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his military
record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by
withdrawing from the ticket.
   Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle
managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about
family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush
administration.
   ``Let's go on to victory!'' Quayle exhorted, as the crowd
erupted in cheers.
   The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm
self-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding his
penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the
unanticipated controversy.
   Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he was
``proud to have Dan Quayle at my side.'' The two will stress the
unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend
through Indiana, Ohio and Illinois.
   But beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent
that threatened Quayle's candidacy just as it was launched.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi _ who worked for Quayle's
grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of The
Indianapolis News _ said he contacted the National Guard on behalf
of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and ``recommended him
very highly,'' the News reported.
   Quayle, a hardliner on defense matters, has said he sought guard
duty so he could attend law school. A Bush aide said the matter was
discussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led to
his selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that he
used influence to gain admittance to the Guard.
   Bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping Quayle
from the ticket, as some Republicans suggested. Quayle was tense
and refused to answer reporters' questions about the topic during a
brief walk-through at the convention hall.
   It was a daunting change for the senator, whose youthful vigor,
rapid political rise, striking good looks and wealth have been
compared to those of John F. Kennedy.
   Quayle alluded to the National Guard issue during his speech,
saying he was proud of the six years he served. He also addressed
his relative anonymity: ``Many this week have asked, `Who is Dan
Quayle?' The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will.''
   Those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out
their ammunition. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who placed Quayle's name
in nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect
concerns that he lacked experience for the job.
   ``He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and senator. ...
That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis,
and he is running for president,'' Dole said.
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, one of those who seconded the
nomination, said Quayle would ``bring vim, vigor and vitality'' to
the party and would bring ``sparks and voltage to this campaign.''
   Whether Quayle can overcome his difficult start on the national
ticket remains to be seen. Others, notably Democratic vice
presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, found they could
not.
   But Quayle, ever upbeat, was determined Thursday night not to be
daunted by the prospect. ``Miracles do happen,'' he told his party.
