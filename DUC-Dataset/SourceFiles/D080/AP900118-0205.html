    The McMartin Pre-school molestation case was
the longest criminal trial in U.S. history. Here is a chronology of
the case:

   <text>
    Aug. 12, 1983: Judy Johnson makes a phone call to Manhattan
Beach Police Department and tells Detective Jane Hoag that she
believes her 2{-year-old son was molested by Raymond Buckey at the
McMartin Pre-School.
   Sept. 7, 1983: Ms. Hoag arrests Buckey, but he is released
later that day for lack of evidence. Police continue the
investigation and stir controversy by sending letters to 200
parents naming Buckey as a child molestation suspect and asking
them to interrogate their children about oral sex, fondling of
genitals and sodomy.
   _Fall of 1983 to spring of 1984: Nearly 400 children are
interviewed by Children's Institute International, and 41 are
listed as victims in a complaint filed by the state.
   Feb. 2, 1984: KABC-TV reporter Wayne Satz, in a newscast,
describes dozens of alleged acts of oral copulation and sodomy with
children.
   _March 22, 1984: Public outcry prompts Los Angeles District
Attorney Robert Philibosian to send the case to grand jurors, who
indict Buckey; his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey; his sister, Peggy
Ann Buckey; his grandmother Virginia McMartin, and three employees,
Mary Ann Jackson, Babette Spitler and Betty Raidor, on 115 charges
of child molestation.
   _March 24, 1984: All seven defendants are arrested and jailed.
Buckey and his mother are held without bail. Bail for he others
ranges from $50,000 to $350,000. Lael Rubin, Christine Johnston and
Glenn Stevens are assigned to the prosecution team. Stevens is
later removed for expressing doubts about evidence, and Ms.
Johnston asks for reassignment.
   _April 20, 1984: The seven defendants plead innocent at an
arraignment, during which they are charged with sexually abusing 18
children over 10 years and using death threats to silence them.
   _June 6, 1984: A preliminary hearing starts with Municipal Judge
Aviva K. Bobb presiding. Thirteen of the 41 alleged victims chosen
from CII interviews take the stand during the 18-month hearing.
   Jan. 22, 1985: The first child witness in the preliminary
hearing testifies that he and other pupils played ``naked games''
and that he had been touched on his genitals by some of the
defendants.
   Jan. 9, 1986: Judge Bobb orders all seven defendants to stand
trial in Superior Court on 135 counts of molestation and
conspiracy, ending the longest preliminary hearing in California
history. The cost of the hearing was estimated at $4 million.
   Jan. 17, 1986: District Attorney Ira Reiner says there is
insufficient evidence to warrant a trial for five of the seven
defendants and asks dismissal of charges against Virginia McMartin,
Peggy Ann Buckey, Mary Ann Jackson, Babette Spitler and Betty
Raidor. The remaining defendants, Buckey and his mother, still face
100 counts of molestation and conspiracy.
   Jan. 23, 1986: Mrs. Buckey is released on $295,000 bail,
reduced from $495,000.
   Dec. 19, 1986: Judy Johnson, the mother who made the first
allegations against Buckey, is found dead, naked and face down in
her home, at age 44. The coroner says she died of fatty
metamorphosis of the liver, an ailment commonly found in alcoholics.
   _April 20, 1987: The trial begins with jury selection. By July
1, 12 jurors and six alternates are chosen from 500 prospective
panelists.
   _July 13, 1987: Opening statements begin after efforts to move
the case elsewhere are quashed by Superior Court Judge William R.
Pounders.
   _July 29, 1987: The first parent to testify says his daughter's
behavior indicates she may have been abused at the school, but he
didn't recognize the warning signs at the time.
   Dec. 10, 1987: Paul Bynum, 39, a former police officer who once
served as a defense investigator in the case, is found dead from an
apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

being jailed nearly five years.
   _April 27, 1989: The trial, hitting the 2-year, 4-day mark,
becomes the longest criminal hearing in U.S. history when it
surpasses by one day the Hillside Strangler trial of Angelo Buono
in 1982-83.
   _May 16, 1989: Peggy McMartin Buckey takes the stand for the
first time and strongly denies she ever sexually assaulted her
students.

counts. The judge declares a mistrial on 13 other counts _ 12
against Buckey and one against both Buckey and his mother.
