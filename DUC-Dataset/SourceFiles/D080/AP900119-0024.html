    Social Worker Defends Child Interviews in McMartin Case.

   <text>
    A therapist defended her interviews of
alleged victims in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial,
despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questions
undermined the prosecution's case.
   The jury on Thursday acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother,
Peggy McMartin Buckey, of 52 child molestation counts and
deadlocked on 13 other counts.
   Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundreds of
McMartin students, and suggested that the goals of therapy are at
odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal
prosecution.
   ``What is in the interest of children is not always in the
interest of the legal system,'' she said.
   Evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest
and most expensive criminal trial in U.S. history included
videotaped interviews of the alleged victims.
   Many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the
sexual abuse investigation by MacFarlane, a social worker and
director of the Child Sexual Abuse Center at Children's Institute
International.
   MacFarlane said Thursday she still believes children from the
school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their
accounts of abuse.
   ``This agency would never have gone all the way through what we
have if we did not believe these children,'' she said.
   At least seven jurors who attended a news conference agreed the
evidence showed children had been molested. But the jurors were
sharply critical of the interviewers' technique at the institute.
   ``The children were never allowed to say in their own words what
happened to them,'' said juror John Breese. ``All the questions
were leading.''
   ``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had
not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,''
juror Brenda Williams said.
   But MacFarlane said that the interviewing techniques were sound,
noting that small children must be interviewed differently than
adults.
   ``I didn't put words into their mouths,'' she said. ``I tried to
enable them to get over their fears.''
   MacFarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have been
done differently, including conducting more interviews over a
longer period of time. She called the outcome of the case a
``tragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to these
children.''
   But the institute's executive director, Mary M. Emmons, said
some good may come out of the case.
   ``It has greatly increased the awareness about the issue of
child sexual abuse and about the problems of prosecuting these
cases,'' she said.
