    Jurors Deadlocked on 13 Charges.

   <text>
    Jurors who have reached verdicts on 52 counts
in the McMartin preschool molestation case said Wednesday they are
deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges in the nation's longest,
costliest criminal trial.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from the
jurors as they ended their day's deliberation and called a hearing
for Thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52
sealed verdicts.
   In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would deal
with the deadlocked counts first, either declaring a mistrial on
those counts and reading the sealed verdicts, or sending the jury
back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts.
   He said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury
back. However, the judge noted that ``The attorneys are hopeful all
the counts will be resolved before we take any verdicts.''
   Pounders said he would discuss the matter with attorneys before
quizzing jurors on whether they want to deliberate further.
   The jurors are deciding whether Raymond Buckey, 31, and his
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are guilty or innocent of
charges they molested children at their family-owned McMartin
Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
   The jury that spent 2{ years hearing evidence in the case have
agreed on 52 verdicts. They have all been sealed. None of the
verdicts is official until it is announced in court and affirmed by
the jury.
   Jurors are in their ninth week of deliberations. Buckey and his
mother are charged with 64 counts of child molestation and the one
shared count of conspiracy.
   One of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is
the conspiracy charge which names both defendants.
   Jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict
one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge, but seemed
perplexed after they received an explanation earlier Wednesday.
   After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they could
convict just one of the defendants on the charge ``if you feel that
the defendant conspired with one or more other persons.''
   However, he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged
overt acts, some of them naming only one defendant. A split
verdict, he said, would require elimination of overt acts alleged
against a defendant acquitted of the charge.
   It was at that point, he said, that some jurors began shaking
their heads in confusion.
   Buckey and his mother were the only defendants required to stand
trial after an 18-month preliminary hearing. Five women teachers
who worked at the McMartin Pre-School had charges against them
dismissed. Among those were Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann, and his
grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the prestigious but now
defunct nursery school.
   On Tuesday, deliberations were halted at midday because a juror
became ill. On Wednesday, the talks did not begin until 1 p.m.
because another juror's child was ill.
   No alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried that
losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial.
