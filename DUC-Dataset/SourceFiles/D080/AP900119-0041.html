    Blame Plentiful in Preschool Molestation Case.
   </title>
   <text>
    There was plenty of blame to go around at the
end of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestation
trial, but no one was willing to accept it.
   In the nation's longest and costliest trial, Raymond Buckey and
his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday on 52
child molestation charges. The jury deadlocked on 13 other charges.
   Afterward, the district attorney who filed the case criticized
the current district attorney. The current district attorney blamed
his predecessor and defense attorneys. And some of the parents of
children who attended the school blamed everybody.
   ``The system is not going to protect children,'' said Jackie
McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but
didn't testify in the case. ``Life is not fair,'' said Robert
Curry, whose son attended the McMartin school. ``I tell my children
all the time ... there is no such thing as fair.''
   The district attorney who originally pursued the case said he
would not have done anything differently.
   Robert Philibosian, now in private practice, angrily dismissed
accusations that he played up the McMartin case in 1984 _ with the
news media acting as eager accomplices _ to boost his public
profile as he ran for district attorney.
   ``I was a professional prosecutor for 16 years before this case
was brought,'' he said. ``To have people who know very little about
professional or prosecutorial ethics, to criticize me personally
that I have some political motive is totally unjustified.''
   Philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeated
him, current District Attorney Ira Reiner. Philibosian said Reiner
hurt prosecutor's chances by dismissing charges against five of the
original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 ``60
Minutes'' interview.
   But Reiner, calling his dismissal of charges for lack of
evidence ``the decision we're proud of,'' said the trial took so
long because of the state's ponderous criminal justice system,
delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by
Philibosian.
   ``This is a case I inherited,'' Reiner said.
   In interviews, many jurors said they believed some of the
children were molested, but the prosecution never established that
the defendants were responsible.
   ``Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't
necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,''
said juror Brenda Williams.
