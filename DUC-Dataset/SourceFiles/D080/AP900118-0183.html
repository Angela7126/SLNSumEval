    Parents, Jurors and Family Members React To Verdicts.

    Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin
Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors
botched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of
justice over hysteria and hype.
   Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and Raymond
Buckey, 31, wept as the verdicts were announced. Jurors found the
pair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13
other counts. Prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges
in a new trial.
   ``I just said, `I told you Ray,''' Mrs. Buckey said. Asked if
her son was surprised, she said. ``He had fear, definitely.''
Buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his
lawyer.
   ``If it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to
you, too. If it had not been in my faith in God I wouldn't be here
today,'' she said.
   But several parents of former students at the school said the
Buckeys won because the system lost.
   ``It was never done properly,'' said parent Alan Lagunoff, who
moved to Central California from suburban Manhattan Beach. ``I have
to sit back and figure out what to do with my son. I fear that
because of this verdict, no child will be seen as a credible
witness from now on.''
   His son, now 10, attended the school for 1{ years but wasn't a
witness at the trial.
   ``I don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into the
courts. It will just be another six-year travesty,'' Lagunoff said.
   ``The system is not going to protect children,'' said Jackie
McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but
didn't testify in the case. ``I don't know what the message is that
the jury wanted to get out. I'm anxious to hear that.''
   Charles Buckey, father of Raymond and husband of Mrs. Buckey,
suggested Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the
case for its entire six years, was motivated by personal ambition.
   ``My concern primarily was Lael Rubin, who is `anything goes' in
order to secure a conviction. ... If you don't win, you don't get
promoted,'' he said.
   Juror Brenda Williams said the evidence failed to convince the
jury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges.
   ``Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't
necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,''
Ms. Williams told reporters.
   Raymond Buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail
during the case, which defense attorneys said was the result of
community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic
mother of one child at the preschool.
   Some observers accused then-District Attorney Robert Philibosian
of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing re-election
campaign against Ira Reiner, who beat him and now runs the district
attorney's office.
   Philibosian, however, insisted he would not have handled the
matter differently.
   ``Ira Reiner has had that case for five years, and I am not
going to take any public criticism directed at me. Let him respond
to the criticism,'' said Philibosian, now in private law practice.
   Also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a
private child therapy group, Children's Institute International, to
conduct the original interviews with the children. Defense
attorneys maintained that questions by the institute's researchers
were leading and prejudicial.
   Jurors agreed.
   ``We never got the children's stories in their own words,'' said
juror John Breese.
   Children's Institute officials didn't immediately return
telephone calls seeking comment.
   Originally, there were seven defendants, including Raymond
Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, the
founder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and grandmother of
Raymond Buckey.
   Hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the
case, which gained worldwide attention with its tales of
underground tunnels at the school and Satanic rituals.
   The focus of the case shifted dramatically over the years as
Reiner reduced the number of charges and dropped five defendants
after reviewing the case. The underground tunnels were never found.
No proof was ever produced of Satanic rituals.
   Reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long,
expensive prosecution.
   ``It took far too long and cost far too much money to have what
has been called perfect justice. We need reform,'' Reiner said,
adding that in trying to describe the case, ``Insane is the word
that comes to mind.''
   The case was the longest and the costliest in American judicial
history, at 2{ years and $15 million. Superior Court Judge William
Pounders said he did what he could to limit its length, cutting 50
witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case.
   For parents and others, there was more to ponder than legal
questions.
   ``Life is not fair. I tell my children all the time ... there is
no such thing as fair,'' said Robert Currie, whose son attended
McMartin but didn't testify at the trial.
   ``It's really a travesty for a case to take this long,'' said
Ms. Rubin, the prosecutor. ``...Not only for the families, the
children in this case, but also for the defendants as well.''
