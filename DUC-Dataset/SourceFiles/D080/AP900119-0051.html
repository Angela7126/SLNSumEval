    `I'd Like to Have No Memories of This'.

    ``Ray Will Die'' is scrawled in
big black letters on the faded green paint of the McMartin
Pre-School, testimony to the rage inflamed by the notorious
child-molesting case.
   Former McMartin teachers Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, were acquitted Thursday of 52 charges of molesting
students. Jurors were deadlocked on 13 other counts.
   Whatever happens on those charges, few in this
upper-middle-class Los Angeles suburb would disagree with the judge
in the trial, William Pounders, who once said, ``The case has
poisoned everyone who had contact with it.''
   Sue Brown, a receptionist at a medical office across the street
from the school, said she had two friends who were involved in the
case and had been convinced of the Buckeys' guilt.
   ``I think they got off scot-free,'' Brown said. ``I'm really
sick about it.''
   Alan Lagunoff, whose son, now 10, testified against the Buckeys,
stood in front of the run-down, long-closed nursery school and
talked about his disappointment.
   ``The defense did everything to prolong the case and the
prosecution did not do enough research to prosecute the case
properly,'' he said.
   A cold wind blasted leaves across the schoolyard as Lagunoff
leaned on the rusted chain-link fence surrounding the dilapidated
L-shaped building.
   ``I'd like to see the school become a center for abused
children,'' he said. ``It should be put to some good use rather
than tear it down.''
   But another longtime Manhattan Beach resident disagreed.
   ``I'd like to see it torn down,'' said Brenda Platt. ``I'd like
to have no memories of this.''
   Platt, who has two children aged 1 and 3, said she has serious
doubts about placing them in a day-care center because of the
McMartin trial.
   ``I think (the McMartin case) is a disgrace to Manhattan Beach
and society. It's totally upsetting,'' Platt said.
   Linda Geisert, another resident of the beach city, was also
upset.
   ``I'm greatly disappointed in the legal system and quite frankly
in the jurors,'' Geisert said.
   For all his disappointment, Lagunoff said he did not feel the
prosecutors should retry the remaining 13 counts.
   ``It would be just more of the same circus,'' he said.
   ``We put so much faith and hope in our courts,'' said Robert
Canter, 74. ``And this is what we get _ frustration.''
