    Kashmir: A Tourist Paradise Becomes a War Zone.
   </title>
   <text>
    Exotic Kashmir, a tourist paradise of
houseboat hotels and Mogul gardens from whose name the English made
``cashmere,'' has become a war zone of separatism and religious
enmity.
   Military jeeps carry senior government officials and civil
servants around Srinagar in these dangerous days, as soldiers and
paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by Moslem
separatists in the Kashmir Valley.
   Intelligence officer M.K. Kaul commands one of the jeeps. At the
beginning of a trip through the city of 1 million people, he turned
to the four soldiers in the jeep's rear seats and ordered: ``Check
your weapons. Be ready to fire.''
   Kaul settled into the front seat, a 9mm pistol in his right
hand. ``These are bad days,'' he murmured. ``These die-hard
terrorists can attack from anywhere.
   To his men, he said: ``Shoot them if you see them.''
   On Monday, an around-the-clock curfew was lifted from 5 a.m.
until noon and stores opened to crowds of customers. Soldiers in
sandbagged bunkers, armed with light machine guns, guarded main
intersections.
   A spokesman for the Jammu-Kashmir state government said the
situation was peaceful and ``absolutely normal'' in Srinagar, the
state's largest city.
   At least 72 people have been killed since the crackdown began
Jan. 20 in an effort to curb attacks on government officials and
buildings. Most of the dead have been Moslem militants shot by
Indian troops.
   ``We are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any
popular movement,'' said Jagmohan, governor of Jammu-Kashmir, the
only state in predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority.
   ``We are fighting a handful of terrorists who are determined to
create a law and order problem,'' said Jagmohan, a Hindu with a
reputation for toughness.
   Other officials in Kashmir say privately the situation is
critical, perhaps the most serious threat India has faced in 42
years of independence from Britain.
   ``It looks like everyone here has turned into a fundamentalist
with firm belief that the day is not far off when they will become
independent,'' a state police officer said.
   Kashmir was a separate kingdom, ruled by a Hindu maharajah, when
Britain relinquished colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1947, and the
subcontinent was partitioned on religious lines into India and
Pakistan.
   The Hindu king opted to join India, not Pakistan, and the
dispute over Kashmir has exacerbated relations since.
   Pakistan took the western part of Kashmir and India the eastern.
Each accused the other of forcible occupation.
   They have fought wars over Kashmir and the border question
remains unresolved. U.N. observers are stationed on the truce line
and the two sides occasionally trade gunfire.
   Officials will not say how many reinforcements have been sent to
the Kashmir Valley since Jan. 20, but reports from various sources
indicate 30,000-and 40,000 soldiers and paramilitary troops have
been deployed.
   It is the valley's heavily Moslem population that tilts the
sectarian scale in Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Of the state's nearly 6 million people, 64 percent are Moslems
and 32 percent Hindus. Most Hindus live in the southern Jammu area.
   Srinagar has 150 mosques. ``This is the best breeding ground for
Moslem fundamentalism,'' said a federal official who helps
coordinate the new security measures.
   Nearly every mosque has a loudspeaker to summon the faithful to
prayer _ and, more recently, to exhort listeners to defend their
faith and Kashmir.
   ``The residents are constantly bombarded with Islamic sermons
and are reminded that fighting a `jihad' (Islamic holy war) is the
most sacred duty of every Moslem,'' the federal official said, on
condition of anonymity.
   Electricity was cut off in the city Friday, which was both the
Moslem sabbath and India's national Republic Day on India's
Republic Day, but many mosque loudspeakers continued operating
because militants connected them to car batteries.
   Intelligence reports suggest the government has an advantage
because the separatists are not united.
   The most powerful group is the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front,
but there are several others, including the Allah Tigers,
Hezb-e-Mujahed Hezb-e-Islami.
   India claims the fundamentalists get money and weapons from
Pakistan. The Pakistanis deny it.
   Jagmohan, the governor, insists the main issue in Kashmir is
economic development, not separatism.
   ``The people do not want violence or the so-called independent
Kashmir,'' he said. ``The need of the hour is development. Let more
tourists come. Let new schools be built. Let new hospitals come
up.''
   As he spoke, military officers waited in the next room to
discuss a new strategy to crush rebellion in what the tourist
brochures call Paradise.
   Right now, Paradise looks lost, at least temporarily.
