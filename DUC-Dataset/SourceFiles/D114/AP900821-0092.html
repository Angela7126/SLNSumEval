    Border Clashes Continuning, Says Prime Minister.

    The army on Tuesday dispatched tanks and
troop reinforcements to the frontier with Pakistan, where soldiers
from the two nations have been fighting recently, officials and
witnesses said.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh told Parliament that Indian armed
forces were ``fully prepared to effectively deal with any
eventuality.''
   Indian and Pakistani troops clashed in a remote border area in
the disputed Kashmir region Monday. Singh, who is also defense
minister, said exchange of fire also occurred Tuesday.
   In Pakistan, a Defense Ministry spokesman, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules, said Tuesday that Indian and
Pakistani soldiers exchanged artillery fire in the Kel sector along
the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir into Pakistani and Indian
regions. He said there were no casualties among Pakistani soldiers.
   The Pakistani official also said that on Monday and Tuesday,
Indian soldiers fired on Pakistani civilians traveling on a
mountain road, injuring four people. He also said Indian soldiers
fired on an ambulance and a bus.
   There was no report from India on the alleged firing.
   Despite the tension, officials from both sides said the
incidents did not appear to be serious.
   ``There is no cause for any undue concern since we trust that
these localized incidents will be contained and the situation
defused,'' United News of India quoted Singh as saying in the
Parliament.
   Singh said directors of military operations from both countries
were in touch. He did not elaborate.
   The Pakistani official said: ``This is not a serious situation.
It's just in one sector. It could be just a local incident. We
don't know what it will lead to. We'll just have to wait and see.''
   India and Pakistan have gone to war twice over Kashmir, in 1965
and 1971. Both sides claim Kashmir, which has been divided into
Indian and Pakistani sectors.
   Tensions over Kashmir flared again this summer.
   India accuses Pakistan of supporting a Moslem secessionist
movement in the Indian sector by providing arms and training to
Moslem militants. Pakistan, an Islamic state, denies the charge but
says it will back any movement for self-determination by Kashmir's
people.
   Jammu-Kashmir state is the only one of India's states with a
Moslem majority. At least 1,034 people have been killed in the
Kashmir valley since New Delhi cracked down on the secessionist
movement on Jan. 20.
   Military officials in Jammu, the summer capital of India-held
Kashmir, said Tuesday that tanks and troops reinforcements were
dispatched to the border areas.
   At least 20 tanks and 30 trucks with soldiers left their
quarters at Kaluchak and Baridrahamna for the frontier, said
witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Indian military officials said the additional troops were sent
to Rajauri and Poonch sectors, which were the scenes of fierce
battles in the wars of 1965 and 1971.
