    Moslem Militants Kill Five, Kidnap One.

    Moslem militants killed five people who
opposed their fight for independence from predominantly Hindu India
and kidnapped a former legislator, officials said Saturday.
   At least 195 people, mostly Moslem demonstrators, have been
killed in the northern state of Jammu-Kashmir since Jan. 20 when
the government launched a crackdown on the separatists.
   State officials said four of the five people killed Friday and
Saturday were Moslems. They were identified as a deputy police
superintendent; the 73-year-old local leader of the Communist Party
of India; the grandson of another prominent Communist leader; and a
man accused of being a police informer.
   The fifth victim was a civilian, the sources added, speaking on
condition of anonymity. It was unclear if he was Hindu or Moslem.
   The former state legislator, Mir Mustafa, was pulled out of his
car at gunpoint Saturday near his home in Badgam, 12 miles west of
Srinagar, officials said.
   Srinagar has been a focal point of the fighting between
government troops and separatists.
   Family members and highly placed sources in the government of
Jammu-Kashmir said no group has claimed responsibility for the
abduction and no demands were issued.
   Mustafa was an independent member of the state legislature. The
governing body was dissolved in January when the federal crackdown
was ordered.
   In December, Mustafa helped negotiate a prisoner exchange in
which the kidnapped daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Saeed
was swapped for five prominent members of the radical Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front.
   The front is one of several Moslem militant groups waging a
campaign of bombings and assassinations to press demands for the
independence of Kashmir, a part of Jammu-Kashmir state.
Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem-majority state in India.
   The secession movement has been simmering since 1947, when the
state of Kashmir was divided between India and Moslem Pakistan.
   The eastern part of the state is governed by India. The western
slice of Kashmir is under Pakistan's control.
   The two countries went to war twice over Kashmir, and their
armies still face each other along the disputed frontier.
