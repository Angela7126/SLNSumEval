    Tens of Thousands March to Moslem Shrine Demanding Freedom.

    Tens of thousands of people chanting
``Freedom! Freedom!'' trekked to a Moslem saint's shrine Saturday
to campaign for the secession of Kashmir from India, witnesses and
pro-separatist activists said.
   At least three people died in two separate incidents on Saturday
in Kashmir, the center of the four-decade-old separatist campaign,
witnesses said.
   The deaths brought to 109 the number of people killed since Jan.
20 in the latest round of the secessionist violence and the
government crackdown.
   Meanwhile, the president of the Pakistan state of Kashmir said
in an interview Saturday that Kashmiris there had begun smuggling
arms across the border to Moslem insurgents fighting for
independence from India.
   President Abdul Qayyum, speaking to a reporter who traveled to
Pakistan's Kashmir, said the people of his state also had been
sheltering insurgents since India launched the military crackdown
in its state of Jammu-Kashmir last month.
   In India's Kashmir, the 600-year-old shrine of Shiekh Nuruddin
Wali at Charift Sharief, 20 miles northwest of Srinagar, became a
sea of humanity as Moslem men, women and children poured in from
Srinagar and nearby towns.
   Vehicles stopped 10 miles from the shrine as people thronged the
roads, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Supporters of the militants said they went to the shrine to seek
the saint's blessings to ``liberate'' Kashmir from India.
   In Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state,
residents were told by Moslem militants to put their clocks back by
30 minutes to correspond with the Pakistan standard time.
   The militants, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, are
demanding either independence for Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian
state dominated by Moslems.
   Groups of young Moslem men sat at street corners, stopping
passers-by and telling them to adjust their watches. At least six
fights broke out when people refused to comply, said witnesses who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Friday, at least 200,000 people marched to the office of the
United Nations Military Observers Group in Srinagar, demanding a
plebiscite in Kashmir, police said. Witnesses claimed that more
than 600,000 people took part.
   The U.N. group is posted to maintain a cease-fire line drawn
between Indian- and Pakistani-held Kashmir after a 1948-49 war over
the region.
   Residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said security
forces fatally shot two men shouting anti-Indian slogans at Khrew,
15 miles southeast of Srinagar.
   In Srinagar, suspected Moslem militants shot and killed Ashok
Kumar, a Hindu government employee, witnesses said, also speaking
on condition of anonymity. Kumar was suspected to be a police
informer.
   India routinely accuses Pakistan of arming, training and
supporting the militants. The government in Islamabad denies the
charge but says the Kashmiri people have a right to
self-determination.
   An AP reporter who traveled to Pakistan's Kashmir last week said
state-run banks in the region have begun collections to help the
uprising. Signs in dozens of banks called for donations for ``a
holy war against India.''
   Naveed Hussain, a government spokesman in Pakistan's Kashmir,
said in an interview that $5,000 had been raised in a week and that
the money would be used to train Kashmiri militia groups in
territory held by Pakistan.
   Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after the two
countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial
rule in 1947.
