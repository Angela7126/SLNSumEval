    Militants Kill Paramilitary Soldiers as Violence Continues in Kashmir.

    Moslem militants armed with automatic
rifles shot and killed two unarmed paramilitary soldiers on
Thursday in Srinagar, the flashpoint of a violent separatist
campaign, officials said.
   Witnesses said a cigarette vendor also was killed in the attack,
which occurred outside the vendor's kiosk in the Chanpora suburb of
the city. A bystander was injured, said the witnesses, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The deaths brought to 81 the number of people killed since Jan.
20 in clashes between security forces and Moslem militants fighting
for secession of the Moslem-dominated Kashmir region from
Hindu-majority India.
   Most victims have been protesters shot while defying a curfew
imposed Jan. 20 when government forces launched a crackdown.
   A senior police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said militants exploded bombs in a government building and a
government-run bank in Srinagar's outskirts Thursday, causing
severe damage. There were no casualties.
   The official also blamed militants for a fire that broke out in
a downtown shopping center. No casualties were reported in the
blaze.
   Security was strengthened across Srinagar after the incidents.
New roadblocks were set up and more paramilitary troops were
deployed on the streets, the official said.
   Some soldiers patrolled in trucks while others perched with
machine guns on the sides of roads. A curfew that was to have begun
at 6 p.m. instead took effect in the afternoon in three areas of
the city after the shootings.
   The two paramilitary Border Security Force officers were shot
with Chinese-designed AK-47 rifles from close range as they walked
from their camp toward the cigarette kiosk, 100 yards from the
camp's gate, said Ashok Patel, inspector-general of the Border
Security Force. He said the men were unarmed and were not in
uniform when attacked.
   It was the first reported slaying by Moslem militants of
paramilitary troops.
   The Border Security Force, known to be a more disciplined and
tougher force that the state constabulary, is normally deployed on
international borders but has been increasingly used to put down
the Kashmir secessionist movement.
   State police began preparations to counter violence Friday, the
Moslem sabbath. On past sabbath days, speeches have been broadcast
from mosques urging people to fight for Kashmir's independence.
   Gov. Jagmohan, known to be a tough administrator who ordered the
Jan. 20 crackdown, on Thursday appealed for peace in Kashmir, the
Himalayan valley once popular for its gardens, lakes and apple
orchards.
   ``Let us impress once again on our young brothers to see the
futility of the cult of guns and understand the magnitude of
all-round misery that it has caused,'' he said in a letter released
by the state government.
   Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses only one name, wrote the letter to
the father of a Moslem youth who was killed in a bomb explosion in
a shopping complex on Wednesday.
   Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after the two
countries were partitioned on gaining independence from Britain in
1947. Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part
of Jammu-Kashmir state, India's only predominantly Moslem state.
   Sixty-four percent of the state's 5 million people are Moslems,
but nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's population of
880 million.
   Kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with
Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem
population, but now they demand independence and the status of a
neutral country.
