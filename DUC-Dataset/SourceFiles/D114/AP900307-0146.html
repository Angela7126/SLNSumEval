    Moslems blew up a truck carrying security
forces Wednesday, killing three soldiers in the few hours the
government relaxed a curfew designed to stop the Kashmiri
separatist uprising, officials said.
   In separate incidents, militants shot and killed a Moslem they
said was a police informer and a Moslem died after he was caught in
an exchange of fire between militants and security forces,
officials said.
   Also Wednesday, Moslem snipers fired on security forces in three
parts of Srinagar during a five-hour relaxation of curfew, said
Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir state. There were no casualties, he
said.
   The curfew was relaxed from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. to allow people in
the city of 1 million to shop for food and other essentials.
   An around-the-clock curfew was imposed Friday after security
forces the day before shot and killed 49 Moslem demonstrators
marching into Srinagar to take part in a pro-independence rally. At
least 1 million Moslems demonstrated to demand independence for the
predominantly Moslem state; India is predominantly Hindu.
   Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, is the center of
the separatist movement.
   At least 171 people have been killed in Kashmir since a
government crackdown on the separatist movement began on Jan. 20.
   Leading national parties decided Wednesday to send a
``high-powered delegation'' to Srinagar, according to the Press
Trust of India news agency. It did not name the members, but it
said they would go Thursday.
   The decision was taken at the end of a daylong multiparty
meeting on Kashmir called by Prime Minister V.P. Singh. A joint
statement after the meeting said ``despite their ideological and
political differences, (the parties) were one in defending the
unity and integrity of the country,'' the news agency reported.
   Jagmohan said the truck was driving around Srinagar distributing
food to troops on street corners when it was blown up by Moslem
militants. He gave no further details of the attack.
   The attacks came amid government claims that security forces
arrested at least 12 leaders of the Moslem group Hezbul Mujahedeen.
Jagmohan said the militants, from Srinagar and the border towns of
Baramulla and Kupwara, have been arrested since Sunday.
   Hezbul Mujahedeen is one of 30 militant groups fighting for
secession. It is believed the second most powerful independence
group after the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front.
   ``We are going to hit hard at anti-national elements, there is
no way they can get away with what they are doing,'' Jagmohan said.
``It may take a month, six months, maybe a year, but ultimately
these anti-national elments are going to be neutralized.''
   Jagmohan, a Hindu, was appointed the state governor of
Jammu-Kashmir on Jan. 18 in an attempt by the government to control
the unrest.
   Kashmir has been a problem for more than four decades following
the 1947 partition of British colonial India into predominantly
Moslem Pakistan and the mostly Hindu India.
   Jammu-Kashmir, then a princely state, chose to merge with India.
Pakistan protested, claiming the territory because of its
predominantly Moslem population.
   The two countries have twice gone to war over the territory.
   The Kashmir portion of Jammu-Kashmir is mostly Moslem, while the
southern Jammu segment is predominantly Hindu. Overall, about 65
percent of the state's 6 million people are Moslem.
   Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million
people and Hindus account for 82 percent.
