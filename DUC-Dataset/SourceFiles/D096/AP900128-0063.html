    San Francisco Routs Broncos in Super Bowl.

    The San Francisco 49ers routed the Denver
Broncos 55-10 Sunday in the most lopsided Super Bowl victory ever.
   The 49ers' win in the 24th Super Bowl made them the first repeat
NFL champion in a decade and tied the Pittsburgh Steelers as a
pinnacle of Super Bowl perfection with four wins in four tries.
   San Francisco won the National Football League championship game
in 1989, 1985 and 1982. The Broncos, on the other hand, lost the
last four Super Bowl games they have played.
   San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana made five touchdown
passes, three to Jerry Rice, breaking a Super Bowl record for
touchdown passes on a day on which he also set a record with 13
straight pass completions.
   He also set five Super Bowl career records, including his third
Super Bowl Most Valuable Player award and San Francisco's point
total was the most ever. Montana left the game with nearly 11
minutes to play.
   In four Super Bowls, he has thrown 11 touchdowns and no
interceptions.
   For Denver quarterback John Elway, it was a day of futility,
ending with his third Super Bowl defeat. He missed eight of his
first 10 passes and was intercepted twice and fumbled once.
   By halftime the score was 27-3. With their third loss in four
years, the Broncos have now been outscored 136-40.
   San Francisco was boringly perfect, doing more than even the
experts who made them favorites by nearly two touchdowns after a
14-2 season and a waltz through the playoffs.
