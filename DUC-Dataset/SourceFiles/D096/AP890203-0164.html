    President Bush congratulated the San Francisco
49ers on Friday and said they ``rewrote the record books'' with
their Super Bowl victory. In turn he was presented with two
autographed balls and a jogging outfit.
   ``Let me congratulate you also on your victory,'' quarterback Joe
Montana told Bush at a East Room reception. Montana said being
invited to the White House ``means a lot to all of us'' and joked:
``Not very often do I get to see these guys in ties.''
   Bush, surrounded by 49ers, told the team, ``With this, your third
Super Bowl title in eight years, you rewrote the record books and
raised the game of football to a new level of excellence.''
   And, to Montana, who drove the team to the winning touchdown on a
92-yard drive late in the fourth quarter, Bush said: ``Joe, you once
again showed your grace under pressure. I guess we all wonder why it
took so long.''
   Bush was presented autographed balls by both Montana and wide
receiver Jerry Rice, who won the game's Most Valuable Player award.
   ``That's the real thing from the Super Bowl,'' Rice said of the
ball he gave the president.
   Bush joked that he heard, ``there is a new TV series coming out
based on your Super Bowl performance _ Miami Rice. Available in
every city in the country except one. Cininnnati, that is.''
   The 49ers beat the Cincinnati Bengals, 20-16, two weeks ago in
Miami.
   Team owner Danny DeBartolo told Bush that he would be presented
with a Super Bowl ring, size 11, ``because we want to make you an
honorary member of our team.''
   And outgoing coach Bill Walsh gave Bush a 49ers jogging outfit,
but cautioned, ``I'm not sure we suggest running in the streets of
Washington, D.C., in this suit....Remember the Redskin fans are all
around us.''
   Super Bowl winners are traditionally invited to the White House.
