    San Francisco Beats Cincinnati in Super Bowl.
   </title>
   <text>
    In a dramatic finish, the San Francisco 49ers
football team won the Super Bowl on Sunday with a 20-16 victory over
the Cincinnati Bengals.
   Joe Montana's 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34
seconds left provided the winning margin.
   The victory was achieved through the brilliance of Montana and
Jerry Rice, the wide receiver who caught 12 passes for 222 yards,
both Super Bowl records. Rice was named the game's most valuable
player.
   The winning score came at the end of a 92-yard drive, engineered
by Montana, whose touchdown pass gave him a Super Bowl record with
357 yards passing.
   It was the fifth straight win for a National Football Conference
team, but by far the most dramatic _ the previous four had been by
an average score of 41-14.
   It also gave 49ers Coach Bill Walsh his third Super Bowl win.
   The game was a defensive struggle in the first half, which ended
in a 3-3 tie. Two key players were injured in the first 14 plays,
Cincinnati's All-Pro nose tackle Tim Krumrie and San Francisco's
tackle Steve Wallace.
   The first touchdown didn't come until 44 minutes into the
60-minute game, when Cincinnati's Stanford Jennings took a kickoff
93 yards for a score.
   The game, before a crowd of 75,179 at Joe Robbie Stadium, went
undisrupted by racial tensions in Miami.
