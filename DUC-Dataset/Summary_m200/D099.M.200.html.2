   TOMORROW evening, just before the Olympic closing ceremony, the last and one of the most prestigious events of the Games will be held.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   It is also without doubt the most gruelling.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic men's marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   There are lots of figures to show why.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   It is estimated that when the race begins in Mataro, a seaside town north of Barcelona, the temperature will be an already-uncomfortable 25`C.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Towards the marathon's end, however, radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to 30`C.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   More debilitating still, relative humidity in Barcelona in August rises as high as 80 per cent.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   With more than 10 kilometres still to go, most of the course is an upward run.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   The last 4.6km, which take the runners 60m higher still to the Olympic stadium at the top of the hill of Montjuic, has an average gradient of more than 4.5 per cent, and includes some sections of 7 per cent, equivalent in skiing terms to a steep 'red' run.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   But we do not need figures to convince us of the extraordinary difficulty of tomorrow's race.
