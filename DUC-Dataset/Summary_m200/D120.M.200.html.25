   THE STORY OF JOHN MAJOR
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her successor and heir, was elected on Nov. 27, 1990 as leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister. Right-wing MPs confirmed the findings in a INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY/NOP [National Opinion Poll] poll that Michael Heseltine was the favourite to replace Mr Major, if he is forced out.

   Some of Mr Major's closest allies were seething with anger at Mr Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, for "posturing" before the damaging retreat last week by the Prime Minister over Britain's veto powers in the enlarged European Union.

   With 185 votes in the three-way race, Major did not gain as many as the 202 votes Thatcher won Nov. 20, when Heseltine was her sole opponent.

   Heseltine, 57, said Major's election "lays the basis for the unity of our party".
