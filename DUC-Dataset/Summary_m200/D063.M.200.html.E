   A barracks at the Royal Marine Music School in Deal was leveled in an explosion on Friday,
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   which killed 10 persons and injured 22 others, 12 seriously.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Responsibility for the blast was claimed by the Irish Republican Army,
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   which said the attack was in response to a recent speech made by Prime Minister Thatcher to the Ulster Defense Regiment.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Calling the speech an "act of war,"
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   the IRA said
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   such attacks would continue until the British withdrew their forces from Northern Ireland
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   and allow a unification of the protestant Northern Ireland with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
  </a>

   The explosion,
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   which could be heard two miles away,
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   came at 8:30 in the morning,
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   just as the musicians were taking a coffee break.
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   Destroying the barracks,
  </a>
  <a href="#14" id="14">
   it also severely damaged a number of neighborhood homes,
  </a>
  <a href="#15" id="15">
   causing minor injuries among their residents.
  </a>
  <a href="#16" id="16">
   Neighbors of the barracks as well as opposition politicians blamed the use of private security firms,
  </a>
  <a href="#17" id="17">
   which, they say,
  </a>
  <a href="#18" id="18">
   caused the security at the base to be lax.
  </a>
  <a href="#19" id="19">
   Defending the use of the firms,
  </a>
  <a href="#20" id="20">
   Defense Secretary Tome King issued an alert for all military bases in Britain.
  </a>
  <a href="#21" id="21">
   The attack is the latest in a series of deadly attacks against British bases in the last 20 years.
