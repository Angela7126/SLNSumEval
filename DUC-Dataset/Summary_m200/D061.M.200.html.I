   Since September 10, Hurricane Gilbert has cut a destructive path through the Caribbean,
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   hitting Jamaica and the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico with its full force.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Gilbert became the third hurricane of the 1988 season on Saturday.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   On Sunday, it passed south of the Greater Antilles,
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   causing flooding,
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   power outages, and airport closures,
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   and knocking down trees and tearing off roofs in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   In the Dominican Republic, five were killed
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   and 10 inches of rain fell.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   The eye of the storm hit Kingston, Jamaica, on Monday,
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   then moved lengthwise across the island,
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   at about 17 mph with sustained winds of 155 mph,
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   causing extensive damage.
  </a>
  <a href="#14" id="14">
   Nineteen were killed in Jamaica.
  </a>
  <a href="#15" id="15">
   The storm buffeted the Cayman Islands,
  </a>
  <a href="#16" id="16">
   then struck the resorts of Cancun and Cozumel on the Yucatan with winds of 160 mph.
  </a>
  <a href="#17" id="17">
   Power and communications were cut,
  </a>
  <a href="#18" id="18">
   flooding was extensive,
  </a>
  <a href="#19" id="19">
   and bands of youths began looting in Cancun.
  </a>
  <a href="#20" id="20">
   By midnight, Gilbert was northeast of the Yucatan
  </a>
  <a href="#21" id="21">
   and heading for the Gulf of Mexico.
  </a>
  <a href="#22" id="22">
   Gilbert was an extremely intense storm,
  </a>
  <a href="#23" id="23">
   attaining the lowest barometric pressure
  </a>
  <a href="#24" id="24">
   ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.
  </a>
  <a href="#25" id="25">
   Forecasters remain baffled by why this trough became such a ferocious storm.
