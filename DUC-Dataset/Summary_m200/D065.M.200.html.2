   PEOPLE in this picture-postcard town of Victorian houses and clean streets don't care what Jay Leno or the polls or the Democrats or disgruntled Republicans have been saying about Dan Quayle.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   Despite the fact that President Bush's health problems have made the vice president a national preoccupation, to people here he's just Danny Quayle from Polk Street -- a really nice guy from a really nice family that runs the local newspaper .
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   He is the most important person ever to come out of this town, and even as the world considers his fitness for the presidency, Huntington is celebrating his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan Quayle Memorabilia Exhibit.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   To those who say Quayle does not merit his own exhibition, Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is, after all, the vice president of the United States.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   "We're preserving history," says David Schenkel, the exhibition coordinator.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   "A century from now someone may want to do a dissertation on him."; If so, Huntington will be ready.
