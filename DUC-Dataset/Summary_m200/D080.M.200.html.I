   The longest, costliest, criminal trial in American history, the McMartin Pre-School molestation case, ended Thursday.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The jury acquitted Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 counts
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   and deadlocked on 13.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   The case began in 1983
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   and became a frenetic witch-hunt led by the California media.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   At one time, seven defendants, 135 charges, and over 400 children were involved.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Following the verdict,
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   defendants wept,
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   while parents decried the system for failing their children.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   The judge was not surprised.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   Jurors faulted the children's videotaped interviews,
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   saying the interviewer asked leading questions.
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   Jurors believed some may have been molested,
  </a>
  <a href="#14" id="14">
   but the prosecution failed to prove the defendants responsible.
  </a>
  <a href="#15" id="15">
   The therapist conducting the interviews defended her technique.
  </a>
  <a href="#16" id="16">
   The current and former Los Angles district attorneys blamed each other and denied their ambitions influenced the case.
  </a>
  <a href="#17" id="17">
   The pre-school's neighbors were disappointed
  </a>
  <a href="#18" id="18">
   and concerned about the building.
  </a>
  <a href="#19" id="19">
   Reverberations will continue.
  </a>
  <a href="#20" id="20">
   Several books and television movies are planned,
  </a>
  <a href="#21" id="21">
   although the response of the networks is not known.
  </a>
  <a href="#22" id="22">
   Two civil suits by former defendants are
  </a>
  <a href="#23" id="23">
   underway and Mrs. Buckey said
  </a>
  <a href="#24" id="24">
   she plans to sue.
  </a>
  <a href="#25" id="25">
   Parents of the children may decide to file civil charges
  </a>
  <a href="#26" id="26">
   because the burden proof is lower.
