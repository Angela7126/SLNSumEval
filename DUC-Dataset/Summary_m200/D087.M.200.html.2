   The US has comfortably won the most relay medals, followed by Britain, the former Soviet Union, the former West Germany (not even counting the six won before 1939), the former East Germany, France and Canada.
  </a>

   Britain alone have won more relay medals (23) than all the Caribbean islands (nine) and Africa (four, including one for South Africa).
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   The Dutch, with one, have more relay medals than all the nations of Asia (nil) and South America (nil) combined.
  </a>

   The Cuban women's 100 metres relay teams of 1968 and 1972 are the only women from outside the developed world to have won relay medals.

  </a>
