  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   a U.S. army band played an old Berlin song
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   as the checkpoint was hoisted onto a waiting flatbed truck, to be taken to a museum.

  <a href="#8" id="8">
   citing Checkpoint Charlie's status as a Cold War symbol,

  <a href="#9" id="9">
   expressed the hope

  <a href="#10" id="10">
   that its removal would bury the conflicts it created.

  <a href="#11" id="11">
   The decision to remove Checkpoint Charlie came as large sections of the wall were being dismantled

   and the opening of the border between the two Berlins made the checkpoint superfluous.

  <a href="#13" id="13">
   Its removal was timed to coincide with a meeting of German and Allied foreign ministers in East Berlin
  </a>
  <a href="#14" id="14">
   to discuss the status of Berlin and a united Germany.
