  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   A series of retailers happened in Bentonville, Arkansas, America, and other places between Mar. 23, 1989 and Nov. 2, 1994.

   Although Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store.

  <a href="#5" id="5">
   At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with sales of $44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers.

   Sometimes, Walton was more reluctant to invest in technology, and had to be persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers, and scanning at check-outs - long before most retailers had recognised their importance - and to invest $20m in an internal satellite communications system.

   By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly $44bn, making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton family probably America's richest.

  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Ten years later, with 330 stores and $1.6bn sales, it was only the 33rd-biggest retailer in the US.
