   THE STORY OF ROBERT MAXWELL
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   On May 29 in 1991, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company.

   On May 23 Maxwell told Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Goldman knew or should have known was controlled by the Maxwell family.

   Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   One transfer to Goldman Sachs was countersigned by Mr Ernest Burrington, former managing director, at the request of Mr Kevin Maxwell on the reported instruction of Robert Maxwell.

   Mr Pein said it had taken most of the year since Mr Maxwell's death to prise the businesses, which include Chess monthly and Bridge monthly from the administrators to the Maxwell empire.
