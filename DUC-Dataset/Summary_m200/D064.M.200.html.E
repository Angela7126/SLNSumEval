   McDonald's has expanded into non-western markets.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   After years of negotiations, McDonald's has been able to open restaurants in Korea, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and China.

   In the Soviet Union, taking a family to McDonald's could cost the average worker two- days wages.

   Only in Korea, with its middle class, does McDonald's stand a chance of becoming a convenience food.
