   Gilbert, a "extremely dangerous hurricane" and one of the strongest storms in history, roared toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Sept. 12, 1988 with 175 mph winds after battering the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the tiny Cayman Islands.

   But by this morning, the once massive storm's maximum sustained winds had flagged to 65 mph, nine less than hurricane strength, and forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared.

   Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.
