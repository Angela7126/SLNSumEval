   IT IS the stuff of a Byzantine Cold War novel, enticing enough to grab the attention of even the most benign conspiracy theorist: Did Mikhail Gorbachev orchestrate the coup that almost overthrew him?
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The blueprint for imposing a state of emergency was drawn by Gorbachev himself last winter.

   He hand-picked the heads of the coercive institutions and other key officials who took part in the coup .

   Some warnings came from Gorbachev's liberal advisers, such as Alexander Yakovlev, shortly before the coup.

   But, incredibly, the clearest signals came from the hard-liners themselves.

   A leading conservative journalist, Alexander Prokhanov, known as the "nightingale of the General Staff," published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the General Staff Academy, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy and Gorbachev's deputy at the Defense Council, Oleg Baklanov.

  <a href="#9" id="9">
   With remarkable candor, Baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union.
  </a>

   Needless to say, Baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the Gang of Eight.
