   In early May elections across Britain, the Conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever,
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   losing 444 seats.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   One editorial claims
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   some Conservatives will link the defeats to Prime Minister John Major,
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   and there is speculation
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   that he could be forced out this autumn.

   A former welfare recipient, John Major was elected Conservative Party leader and successor to his mentor Margaret Thatcher
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   when she resigned under pressure in November 1990.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   After Mrs. Thatcher submitted her seals of office,
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   Major was called by Queen Elizabeth II
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   to form a new government,
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   and it was expected
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   that there would be no significant policy shift.

   Major's comment

  <a href="#15" id="15">
   while visiting America a month later that Iraqi troops might have to be "forcibly removed" from Kuwait echoed Mrs. Thatcher's hard- line on the Persian Gulf.

   Within a year of winning the general election,
  </a>
  <a href="#17" id="17">
   his popularity had plunged.

  <a href="#18" id="18">
   In the July 1993 Christchurch by-election the Conservative majority of 23,015

  <a href="#19" id="19">
   the previous year was converted into a 16,427 majority for the Liberal Democrats.
  </a>
  <a href="#20" id="20">
   Though Major's personal style is preferable to that of Mrs. Thatcher, he is characterized as a vacillating, weak leader,
  </a>
  <a href="#21" id="21">
   lacking vision and political conviction.
  </a>
  <a href="#22" id="22">
   Not even recent revelations

   that Major uses salty language can alter his wimp image.
