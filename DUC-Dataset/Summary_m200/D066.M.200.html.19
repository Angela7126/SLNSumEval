   SAM WALTON was arguably the most important retailer of his generation.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The church-going son of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a store chain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before his death in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer.

  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Although Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from 1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount store.

   Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way Walton has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   The chain's success stemmed both from Mr Walton's personality and willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy.

   He would deliver pep-talks to employees extolling the virtues of thrift and customer satisfaction, long before these became fashionable management buzz-words.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Employee satisfaction - an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptance in US service industries - was also a vital ingredient in the Walton philosophy.
  </a>

   Also essential to Wal-Mart's growth was its pioneering of high volume, cut-price retailing throughout the year, rather than the periodic sales which rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty.
