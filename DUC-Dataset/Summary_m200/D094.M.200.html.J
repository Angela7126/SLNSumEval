   Emperor Hirohito, who died on January 7 of cancer after several months of internal bleeding,
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   left a taxable estate of approximately $13 million.

  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Posthumously named Showa, or Enlightened Peace, the name of his reign,
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Hirohito will be remembered for his most courageous decision in his 62-year reign:
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   Japan must surrender and end the Pacific conflict in WW II.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   Though many world leaders mourned his death, painful WW II memories sparked criticism of the monarch.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   South Korea sent condolences,
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   but a government party statement added,
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   "We reserve further comment, considering the unhappy past."

  <a href="#10" id="10">
   A Taiwanese newspaper noted
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   that "while Hirohito apologized to the United States and Europe...",
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   he did not direct a single word to China..."

   a BBC documentary by Edward Behr challenged this view,
  </a>
  <a href="#15" id="15">
   alleging that Hirohito had advance knowledge of the Pearl Harbor attack.
  </a>
  <a href="#16" id="16">
   The show also claims
  </a>
  <a href="#17" id="17">
   that President Truman decided not to prosecute Hirohito for war crimes,
  </a>
  <a href="#18" id="18">
   and Japan's wartime prime minister, Gen.Tojo, was pressured into changing his testimony to avoid incriminating the emperor.
  </a>
  <a href="#19" id="19">
   A letter to the editor of an LA newspaper after Hirohito's death also expressed doubt
  </a>
  <a href="#20" id="20">
   that he was blameless.
