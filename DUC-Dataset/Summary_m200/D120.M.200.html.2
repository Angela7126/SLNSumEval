   Last year a biography of Mrs Norma Major - or, if we are being old-fashioned, Mrs John Major - claimed that the Majors' favourite film was Being There.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   I entirely concur with their choice.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican party's power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   In Chauncey's bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   He has a deadly innocence.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   No wonder the Majors liked this film.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chauncey's.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   If he did not see the similarity, that is still more revealing.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   Do not protest that the urban John Major could not identify with a gardener.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   In an interview with Farmers Weekly, a few days ago, Major disclosed an unknown fact: his father was once a farmer.
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   Farmers Weekly, you see, had asked Major how he had 'such obvious empathy with agriculture'.
