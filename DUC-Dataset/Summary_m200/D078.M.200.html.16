   But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism, this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising wrinkle: Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the Oscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammed with Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.

   The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold off seven Oscars in the past year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's ``An American in Paris'' ($15,760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for 1954's ``On the Waterfront'' ($13,000) and the black and white interior decoration Oscar for 1941's ``How Green Was My Valley'' ($1! 7,! 715).

   Although Waters acknowledged that the Creative House trophy is ``very similar'' to the Oscar, he rejected all of the academy's legal claims, saying that the statuette became part of the public domain prior to Jan. 1, 1978, the effective date of the Copyright Act of 1976.
