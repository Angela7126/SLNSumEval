   An explosion at 8:28 A.M. on 22 September destroyed a military barracks in Deal, a town southeast of London in County Kent.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   The barracks was home to the Royal Marines School of Music.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Ten military bandsmen were killed, and as many as 22 were injured, eight seriously.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   Neighbors expressed shock at the strength of the blast.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   No serious injuries to civilians were reported,
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   but neighboring homes suffered heavy damage.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   The IRA claimed
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   responsibility for the attack,
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   linking it what they called a warlike speech delivered by Mrs. Thatcher during a recent visit to Northern Ireland.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   Investigators said
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   the damage was illustrative of that caused by a bomb.
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   The IRA has a record
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   of attacking military installations,
  </a>
  <a href="#14" id="14">
   and this latest attack was the more damaging than any in more than seven years.
  </a>
  <a href="#15" id="15">
   The Prime Ministers of Britain and Ireland have denounced the attack.
  </a>
  <a href="#16" id="16">
   Police are seeking three men with Irish accents who lived near the barracks for a short time.
  </a>
  <a href="#17" id="17">
   Private security firms serve the barracks at Deal and 29 other bases in Britain.
  </a>
  <a href="#18" id="18">
   Families of the victims and opposition party leaders have criticized the arrangement,
  </a>
  <a href="#19" id="19">
   blaming the attack on lax security because of the private guards.
