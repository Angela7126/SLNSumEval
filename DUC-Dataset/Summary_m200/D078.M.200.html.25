   The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold off seven Oscars in the past year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's "An American in Paris" ($15,760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for 1954's "On the Waterfront" ($13,000) and the black and white interior decoration Oscar for 1941's "How Green Was My Valley" ($17,715).

   Alan Carr, who produced the Oscar show, had ordered that the details of the opening number be kept secret until on Mar. 28, 1989 night's ABC telecast. Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its director at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favored "Broadcast News" to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on April 11 have been significantly reduced .
