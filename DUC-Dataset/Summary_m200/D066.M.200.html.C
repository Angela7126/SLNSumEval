   Sam Walton died in April 1992, shortly after his 74th birthday on 29 March.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   He rose from humble beginnings
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   to become the country's richest man.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   He accomplished this by dint of hard work, an engaging personality and willingness
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   to defy accepted retailing practices.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   After earning a college degree
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   and serving in the army,
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   he opened a Ben Franklin franchise in Arkansas.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   In 1962 his brother joined him
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   and they opened the first Wal-Mart.
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   When Wal-Mart was incorporated in 1971 there were 38 outlets.
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   Wal-Mart's revenues then were only nine percent of Sears' and 11 percent of K-Mart's.
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   Wal-Mart experienced phenomenal growth.
  </a>
  <a href="#14" id="14">
   In 1991, the year before Walton's death, Wal-Mart's revenues were greater than those of any other discount retailer.
  </a>
  <a href="#15" id="15">
   Walton eschewed the publicity
  </a>
  <a href="#16" id="16">
   that accompanied the annual Forbes' listing of the richest people.
  </a>
  <a href="#17" id="17">
   He spent most of his time at home in Arkansas,
  </a>
  <a href="#18" id="18">
   and whenever possible he visited his stores
  </a>
  <a href="#19" id="19">
   to exchange ideas with his salespeople,
  </a>
  <a href="#20" id="20">
   or as he called them "his associates".
  </a>
  <a href="#21" id="21">
   He was criticized for putting his stores in small towns,
  </a>
  <a href="#22" id="22">
   and causing the failure of many small businesses.
  </a>
  <a href="#23" id="23">
   He was also criticized for his anti-union policies.
