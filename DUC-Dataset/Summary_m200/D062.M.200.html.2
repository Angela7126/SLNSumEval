   Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last Tuesday's Northern California earthquake.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   With Congress already moving to grant up to $3 billion in relief, earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the state's share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible, and as soon as is practical.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Deukmejian should be commended, as well, for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape .

   The governor is wrong, however, in his campaign to distance himself from the California Department of Transportation on the issue of what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse, and what could or should have been done to have prevented it.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   While Deukmejian is not necessarily blaming Caltrans, he seems to be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as: "What did you know and when did you know it"?
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   The governor's answer, which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake, was that no one in Caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake.
