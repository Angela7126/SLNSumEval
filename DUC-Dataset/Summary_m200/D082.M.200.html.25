   While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News said.

   Sakharov, who did not mention the name of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, described as "anti-democratic" some measures taken to quell nationalist unrest, particularly the toxic gas believed to have been used against demonstrators in Soviet Georgia earlier in 1989. A friend of the family, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he heard estimates that 70,000 mourners viewed the body before it was returned to Sakharov's apartment at midnight .
