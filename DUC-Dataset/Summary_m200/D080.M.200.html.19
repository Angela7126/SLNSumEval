   Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty Thursday, 01/18/1990, of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach, a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history.

   An eight-man, four-woman jury -- 10 of the members parents themselves -- acquitted the Buckeys of 52 counts of molestation after deliberating for nine weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two years.

   The jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations.

   Most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been molested, but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Buckeys were culpable.

   Jurors were critical of the prosecutors' methods.
