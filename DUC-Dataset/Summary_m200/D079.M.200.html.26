   (09/15/1988) The most intense hurricane on record surged toward Texas on 09/15/1988 after battering the Yucatan Peninsula with 160 mph winds, leveling slums, pummeling posh resorts and forcing tens of thousands to flee.

   (09/15/1988) The hurricane, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.

   (09/17/1988) The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm as it blustered northwestward on 09/17/1988 but it threw tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees along the Texas-Mexico border.

   (09/17/1988) At least 109 people have been killed and more than 800,000 left homeless since Gilbert ripped through the Caribbean with 175 mph wind earlier this week, then crossed the Yucatan Peninsula and Gulf of Mexico before slamming into northeastern Mexico.
