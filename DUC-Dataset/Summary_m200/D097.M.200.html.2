   Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   New York-based American International Group Inc. expects net losses related to Hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   Analysts said AIG has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages.
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   AIG insured property in Puerto Rico, the eastern Caribbean Islands and the coastal regions of the Carolinas.
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   That amount takes into consideration what St. Paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimates that Cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis.

   That would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter.
