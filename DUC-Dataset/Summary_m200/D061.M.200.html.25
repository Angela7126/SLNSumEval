   Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused flooding in the Dominican Republic on Sept. 10, 1988 night as the hurricane's center passed just south of the Barahona peninsula, then less than 100 miles from neighboring Haiti.

   Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula on Sept. 13, 1988 and leveled thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel.

   As Gilbert moved away from the Yucatan Peninsula on Sept. 13, 1988 night, the hurricane formed a double eye, two concentric circles of thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has crossed land and is moving over the water again.

   Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage.
