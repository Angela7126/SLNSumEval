   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev returned to power
  </a>
  <a href="#2" id="2">
   as the coup against him collapsed while he was vacationing in Crimea.
  </a>
  <a href="#3" id="3">
   The coup unraveled swiftly
  </a>
  <a href="#4" id="4">
   as the junta was unable to cope with thousands of people
  </a>
  <a href="#5" id="5">
   who erected barricades around Yeltsin's stronghold, the Russian Parliament.
  </a>
  <a href="#6" id="6">
   The national legislature demanded Gorbachev's reinstatement and nullified the coup leaders' decrees.
  </a>
  <a href="#7" id="7">
   The Communist Party, seeking to salvage its image, denounced the takeover.
  </a>
  <a href="#8" id="8">
   The coup people thought they could take over by neutralizing Gorbachev.
  </a>
  <a href="#9" id="9">
   However, the real issue was not Gorbachev but the new political culture of freedom and democracy his reforms had created.
  </a>
  <a href="#10" id="10">
   Gorbachev initiated the changes
  </a>
  <a href="#11" id="11">
   but his standing was transformed when he was trumped by Russia's President Boris Yeltsin who, unlike Gorbachev, challenged the Communist Party and stayed close to the Russian people.
  </a>
  <a href="#12" id="12">
   Gorbachev and Yeltsin at first appeared as equals while launching a purge of the Communist Party,
  </a>
  <a href="#13" id="13">
   although Gorbachev balked at Yeltsin's proposals to ban the Communist Party.
  </a>
  <a href="#14" id="14">
   Later, Yeltsin made it clear in the Russian Parliament
  </a>
  <a href="#15" id="15">
   that Gorbachev has authority only if agreeing to share power
  </a>
  <a href="#16" id="16">
   and intensify the march toward a democracy and a free economy.
  </a>
  <a href="#17" id="17">
   There is speculation that Gorbachev orchestrated the coup
  </a>
  <a href="#18" id="18">
   in order to ferret out the disloyal.
