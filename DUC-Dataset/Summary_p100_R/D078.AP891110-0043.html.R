<a href="#1" id="1">The Star Award depicted a naked, muscular male much like the Oscar, just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a sword.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette and that the academy's trademark and service marks for the Oscar and the Academy Award names and symbols are unaffected.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Academy President Karl Malden said the ruling ``comes as a shock to me.''</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only was an honorary award but also was used to promote the film industry, and therefore did not have a ``limited purpose,'' as required by the copyright act.</a>
