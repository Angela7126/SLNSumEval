<a href="#2" id="2">Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry, possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard spokesman, who was not identified.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">There were no casualties, he said.</a>
<a href="#5" id="5">Freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its vicinity to the ports of Delfzijl in the Netherlands and Emden in West Germany.</a>
