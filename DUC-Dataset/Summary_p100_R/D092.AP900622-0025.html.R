<a href="#1" id="1">``Iran is in a very active seismic region,'' he said, and that there have been many smaller quakes.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">``It's very similar to what we had in Armenia,'' said Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight.</a>
