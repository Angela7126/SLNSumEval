<a href="#0" id="0">Iranian news media reacted with little emotion Thursday to a killer earthquake that left an estimated 25,000 people dead in northern Iran.</a>
<a href="#1" id="1">Roughly the same number died in a December, 1988, quake in nearby Soviet Armenia.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The radio, like the agency, also kept listeners informed about the areas hit and the number of casualties.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">The only detail reported for hours was that, when the quake hit, Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer match between Brazil and Scotland.</a>
<a href="#4" id="4">Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani declared a three-day period of mourning for quake victims.</a>
