<a href="#1" id="1">``There is a danger of many people who hold Nelson Mandela in very, very high esteem taking great umbrage'' at any public protest, Dinkins said.</a>
<a href="#2" id="2">The mayor also asked members of the ``organized Jewish community'' to dissuade more radical groups from disrupting the visit, the Daily News said.</a>
<a href="#3" id="3">Rabbi Abraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute announced his Coalition of Concern will hold a protest at Mandela's public welcome in New York because of the anti-apartheid leader's ``unbending anti-Israel stance.''</a>
