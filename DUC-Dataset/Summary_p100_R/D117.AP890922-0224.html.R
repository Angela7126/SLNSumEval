<a href="#0" id="0">This year's six nominees were chosen Thursday from 102 books considered by a panel headed by David Lodge, a British literary critic and novelist who was nominated for the prize last year for his book, ``Nice Work.''</a>

<a href="#2" id="2">Ishiguro, previously nominated for the award, ``was beaten as the Booker favorite in 1986, which makes his chances that much stronger this time in our view,'' said William Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe.</a>
